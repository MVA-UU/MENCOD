The secondary outcomes were the VAS pain score at 2, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after surgery, the frequency with which patients pushed the button (FPB) of the patient-controlled analgesia system, and the fentanyl consumption at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. Other outcomes were satisfaction scores regarding pain control and the overall recovery process, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and length of hospital stay (HS).Preoperatively and throughout the surgery, Group L received intravenous lidocaine infusion (a 1.5-mg/kg bolus followed by a 2-mg/kg/h infusion until the end of the surgical procedure) and Group C received normal saline infusion as a placebo.The VAS scores and fentanyl consumption were significantly lower in Group L compared with Group C except at 48 h after surgery (p<.05). Total fentanyl consumption, total FPB, length of HS, and satisfaction scores were also significantly lower in Group L compared with Group C (p<.05).Intraoperative systemic infusion of lidocaine decreases pain perception during microdiscectomy, thus reducing the consumption of opioid and the severity of postoperative pain. This effect contributes to reduce the length of HS.",1

It is hypothesized that patients with lumbar spinal stenosis treated with IPD have a faster short-term recovery, an equal outcome after 2 years and less back pain compared with bony decompression.A randomized design with variable block sizes was used, with allocations stratified according to center. Allocations were stored in prepared opaque, coded and sealed envelopes, and patients and research nurses were blind throughout the follow-up. Five neurosurgical centers (including one academic and four secondary level care centers) included participants. 211 participants were referred to the Leiden-The Hague Spine Prognostic Study Group. 159 participants with INC based on lumbar spinal stenosis at one or two levels with an indication for surgery were randomized into two groups. Patients and research nurses were blinded for the allocated treatment throughout the study period. 80 participants received an IPD and 79 participants underwent spinal bony decompression. The primary outcome at long-term (2-year) follow-up was the score for the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire. Repeated measurement analyses were applied to compare outcomes over time.At two years, the success rate according to the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire for the IPD group [69 % (95 % CI 57-78 %)] did not show a significant difference compared with standard bony decompression [60 % (95 % CI 48-71 %) p value 0.2]. Reoperations, because of absence of recovery, were indicated and performed in 23 cases (33 %) of the IPD group versus 6 (8 %) patients of the bony decompression group (p < 0.01). Furthermore, long-term VAS back pain was significantly higher [36 mm on a 100 mm scale (95 % CI 24-48)] in the IPD group compared to the bony decompression group [28 mm (95 % CI 23-34) p value 0.04].This double-blinded study could not confirm the advantage of IPD without bony decompression over conventional 'simple' decompression, two years after surgery. Moreover, in the IPD treatment arm, the reoperation rate was higher and back pain was even slightly more intense compared to the decompression treatment arm.",1

Double-blind randomization of interspinous implant or bony decompression for treatment of spinal stenosis related intermittent neurogenic claudication,"Decompressive laminotomy is the standard surgical procedure in the treatment of patients with canal stenosis related intermittent neurogenic claudication. New techniques, such as interspinous process implants, claim a shorter hospital stay, less post-operative pain and equal long-term functional outcome. A comparative (cost-) effectiveness study has not been performed yet. This protocol describes the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on (cost-) effectiveness of the use of interspinous process implants versus conventional decompression surgery in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.Patients (age 40-85) presenting with intermittent neurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis lasting more than 3 months refractory to conservative treatment, are included. Randomization into interspinous implant surgery versus bony decompression surgery will take place in the operating room after induction of anesthesia. The primary outcome measure is the functional assessment of the patient measured by the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ), at 8 weeks and 1 year after surgery. Other outcome parameters include perceived recovery, leg and back pain, incidence of re-operations, complications, quality of life, medical consumption, absenteeism and costs. The study is a randomized multi-institutional trial, in which two surgical techniques are compared in a parallel group design. Patients and research nurses are kept blinded of the allocated treatment during the follow-up period of 1 year.Currently decompressive laminotomy is the golden standard in the surgical treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. Whether surgery with interspinous implants is a reasonable alternative can be determined by this trial.Dutch Trial register number: NTR1307.",1

Interspinous implants have been on the market for more than 10 years, but no prospective study comparing its outcome with decompression has been performed.After power calculation, 100 patients were included: 50 in the X-Stop group and 50 in the decompression group. Patients with symptomatic 1- or 2-level lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication relieved on flexion were included. X-Stop operations were performed under local anesthesia.The mean patient age was 69 (49-89) years, and the male/female distribution was 56/44. Minimal dural sac area was in all cases except two 80 mm or less.The noninferiority hypothesis included 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up, and included. intention-to-treat as well as as-treated analyses.The primary outcome meansure was the Zürich Claudication Questionnaire, and the secondary outcome measures was the visual analogue scale pain, Short-Form 36 (SF-36), complications, and reoperations.The primary and secondary outcome measures of patients in both groups improved significantly. The results were similar at 6, 12, and 24 months and at no time point could any statistical difference between the 2 types of surgery be identified. Three patients (6%) in the decompression group underwent further surgery, compared with 13 patients (26%) in the X-Stop group (P = 0.04). Results were identical in intention-to-treat and as-treated analyses.For spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication, decompressive surgery as well as X-Stop are appropriate procedures. Similar results were achieved in both groups, however, with a higher number of reoperations in the X-Stop group. Patients having X-Stop removal and decompression experienced results similar to those randomized to primary decompression.1.",1

The X STOP Interspinous Process Distraction System (St. Francis Medical Technologies, Concord, Calif.), a new interspinous implant for patients whose symptoms are exacerbated in extension and relieved in flexion, has been available in Europe since June 2002. This study reports the results from a prospective, randomized trial of the X STOP conducted at nine centers in the U.S. Two hundred patients were enrolled in the study and 191 were treated; 100 received the X STOP and 91 received non-operative therapy (NON OP) as a control. The Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) was the primary outcomes measurement. Validated for lumbar spinal stenosis patients, the ZCQ measures physical function, symptom severity, and patient satisfaction. Patients completed the ZCQ upon enrollment and at follow-up periods of 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. Using the ZCQ criteria, at 6 weeks the success rate was 52% for X STOP patients and 10% for NON OP patients. At 6 months, the success rates were 52 and 9%, respectively, and at 1 year, 59 and 12%. The results of this prospective study indicate that the X STOP offers a significant improvement over non-operative therapies at 1 year with a success rate comparable to published reports for decompressive laminectomy, but with considerably lower morbidity.",1

High-quality comparative data with these devices are lacking.Patients presenting with intermittent neurogenic claudication secondary to moderate LSS who failed at least 6 months of nonsurgical management were randomly allocated to treatment with the Superion spacer or a control spacer (X-Stop) and followed for 2 years.A total of 391 randomized patients were implanted with Superion (n = 190) or control (n = 201) spacers at 29 sites in the United States between August 2008 and December 2011. Implants were successfully implanted in 99.5% of patients with Superion and 99.0% of control patients. The primary composite endpoint of this study was met, which demonstrated that the Superion spacer was noninferior to the X-Stop spacer. Leg pain, the predominant patient complaint, decreased in severity by 70% during 2 years in each group. Most (77%) patients achieved leg pain clinical success (improvement ≥20 mm) at 2 years. Back pain clinical success (improvement ≥20 mm) was 68%, with no differences between groups. Oswestry Disability Index clinical success (≥15% point improvement) was achieved in 65% of patients.

The purpose of this prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial was to compare 2-year clinical outcomes in patients with moderate LSS treated with the Superion® (Experimental) or the X-Stop®, a FDA-approved interspinous spacer (Control). Methods A total of 250 patients with moderate LSS unresponsive to conservative care were randomly allocated to treatment with the Experimental (n = 123) or Control (n = 127) interspinous spacer and followed through 2 years post-treatment. Complication data were available for all patients and patient-reported outcomes were available for 192 patients (101 Experimental, 91 Control) at 2 years. Results Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) Symptom Severity and Physical Function scores improved 34% to 36% in both groups through 2 years (all p &lt; 0.001). Patient Satisfaction scores at 2 years were 1.8 ± 0.9 with Experimental and 1.6 ± 0.8 with Control. Axial pain decreased from 59 ± 26 mm at baseline to 21 ± 26 mm at 2 years with Experimental and from 55 ± 26 mm to 21 ± 25 mm with Control (both p &lt; 0.001). Extremity pain decreased from 67 ± 24 mm to 14 ± 22 mm at 2 years with Experimental and from 63 ± 24 mm to 18 ± 23 mm with Control (both p &lt; 0.001). Back function assessed with the Oswestry Disability Index similarly improved with Experimental (37 ± 12% to 18 ± 16%) and Control (39 ± 12% to 20 ± 16%) (both p &lt; 0.001). Freedom from reoperation at the index level was 84% for Experimental and 83% for Control (log-rank: p = 0.38) at 2 years. Conclusions Both interspinous spacers effectively alleviated pain and improved back function to a similar degree through 2 years in patients with moderate LSS who were unresponsive to conservative care.

There is a trend towards performing less invasive surgical procedures, but no multicentre randomized controlled trials have evaluated the relative efficacy of these techniques at short and long-term.A multicentre randomized controlled trial [the Spinal Stenosis Trial (SST) (part of the NORDSTEN study)] including 465 patients aged 18-80 years with neurogenic claudication or radiating pain and MRI findings indicating lumbar spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis is performed to compare three posterior decompression techniques: unilateral laminotomy with crossover, bilateral laminotomy and spinous process osteotomy. The primary outcome is change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI 2 years postoperatively). Secondary outcomes are change in EQ-5D, Zurich Claudication Questionnaire, and Numeric Rating Scale for leg-pain and back-pain. Also recorded were Global Perceived Effect score, complications, length of hospital stay, reoperation rate 2 years postoperatively, difference in recurrence of symptoms or postoperative instability, and MRI change in the dural sac area. Further, a 5 and 10 years follow-up is planned with the same outcome measures.Newer and less invasive techniques are increasingly favoured in surgery for LSS.

Materials and Methods The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial comprising 152 patients; 80 were randomized to TDR and 72 to fusion. Mean age was 40 years (21 to 55) and 59% were women. All patients suffered from CLBP with varying degrees of leg pain and had not responded to a nonsurgical treatment program. Diagnosis was based on clinical examination, radiographs, and MRI. Primary outcome measure was global assessment (GA) of back pain and secondary outcome measures were back and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), EQ5D, and SF-36. All measures were collected from SweSpine, the Swedish national register for spinal surgery, at 1, 2, and 5 years. Follow-up rate at 5 years were 99.3% with no crossover.

Patients aged 25-65 years with CLBP for at least 2 years and with radiologic evidence of disc degeneration at L4-L5, L5-S1, or both were eligible to participate in the study. The surgical group (n=222) included three different fusion techniques, not analyzed separately in this study. Patients in the nonsurgical group (n=72) were treated with different kinds of physical therapy. The surgical group comprised 49.5% men, and the mean age was 43 years. The corresponding figures for the nonsurgical group were 48.6% and 44 years. The patients had suffered from low back pain for a mean of 7.8 and 8.5 years and been on sick leave due to back pain for a mean of 3.2 and 2.9 years, respectively. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to measure pain. The Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire, the Million Score and the General Function Score (GFS) were used to measure disability. The Zung Depression Scale was used to measure depressive symptoms. The overall result was assessed by the patient and by an independent observer. Records from the Swedish Social Insurance were used to evaluate work disability. Patients who changed groups were included in the analyses of significance according to the intention-to-treat principle.At the 2-year follow-up 289 of 294 (98%) patients, including 25 who had changed groups, were examined. Back pain was reduced in the surgical group by 33% (64 to 43), compared with 7% (63 to 58) in the nonsurgical group (P=0.0002). Pain improved most during the first 6 months and then gradually deteriorated. Disability according to Oswestry was reduced by 25% (47 to 36) compared with 6% (48 to 46) among nonsurgical patients (P=0.015), according to Million by 28% (64 to 46) compared with 8% (66 to 60) (P=0.004), and accordingtoGFS by 31% (49 to 34) compared with 4% (48 to 46) (P=0.005). The depressive symptoms, according to Zung, were reduced by 20% (39 to 31) in the surgical group compared with 7% (39 to 36) in the nonsurgical group (P=0.123). In the surgical group 63% (122/195) rated themselves as ""much better"" or ""better"" compared with 29% (18/62) in the nonsurgical group (P<0.0001). The ""net back to work rate"" was significantly in favor of surgical treatment, or 36% vs. 13% (P=0.002). The early complication rate in the surgical group was 17%.Lumbar fusion in a well-informed and selected group of patients with severe CLBP can diminish pain and decrease disability more efficiently than commonly used nonsurgical treatment.",1

Treatment was decompressive surgery or usual nonsurgical care. The primary outcomes were measures of bodily pain and physical function on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) and the modified Oswestry Disability Index at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 and 2 years.A total of 289 patients were enrolled in the randomized cohort, and 365 patients were enrolled in the observational cohort. At 2 years, 67% of patients who were randomly assigned to surgery had undergone surgery, whereas 43% of those who were randomly assigned to receive nonsurgical care had also undergone surgery. Despite the high level of nonadherence, the intention-to-treat analysis of the randomized cohort showed a significant treatment effect favoring surgery on the SF-36 scale for bodily pain, with a mean difference in change from baseline of 7.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 14.1); however, there was no significant difference in scores on physical function or on the Oswestry Disability Index. The as-treated analysis, which combined both cohorts and was adjusted for potential confounders, showed a significant advantage for surgery by 3 months for all primary outcomes; these changes remained significant at 2 years.In the combined as-treated analysis, patients who underwent surgery showed significantly more improvement in all primary outcomes than did patients who were treated nonsurgically.

METHOD: Sixty consecutive patients with an average age of 58 years (34-81) who were selected for primary lumbosacral decompression were randomly assigned into two groups with equal number of patients, decompression alone or decompression with Wallis implant. The patients had an average follow-up of 40 months. Patients were assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) (Boonstra et al., Int J Rehabil Res 31:165-169, 2008; Price et al., Pain 17:45-56, 1983) pain score for back and leg pain, and the Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire (ODI) (Smeets et al., Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken) 63:S158-S173, 2011). RESULTS: The results in both the groups did not reveal a significant difference in the clinical outcome assessment of back pain score or ODI. With the Wilcoxon two-sample test, no difference in median values was achieved (p value 0.0787 for ODI and p value 0.1926 for back pain). The average ODI in the Wallis group dropped from 50.93 to 29.11. The average VAS for the Wallis group back pain dropped from 7.79 to 4.22. CONCLUSION: The Wallis implant is a safe medical device. This study revealed a reduction in pain and functional disability in patients treated with decompression surgery for lumbar stenosis, with or without Wallis. The Wallis group improved more, but it was not statistically significant. The risk of complications is lower than other interspinous devices.",1

The patients were treated from July 2008 to July 2011 at 1 institution. Of the 77 patients, 40 allocated to undergo posterior lumbar discectomy with Wallis implantation and 37 without Wallis implantation. The primary outcomes were the visual analog scale score, Japanese Orthopedics Association score, and Oswestry Disability Index. The secondary outcomes were the intervertebral disc height, range of motion of the operated segments, complications, and operating time.At 3 years, the improvements in the primary outcomes were not different between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). The disc height was significantly greater in the Wallis group than in the control group (P < 0.001). Two patients in the Wallis group and three patients in the control group underwent further surgery to treat repeated prolapse of the index segment or an adjacent segment. No significant difference was found in the complication rate between the 2 groups (P > 0.05).We found that discectomy combined with Wallis implantation was not beneficial for pain relief or lumbar function improvement compared with lumbar discectomy alone. Although the Wallis implant was associated with maintenance of the intervertebral disc height and limited range of motion of the spine, it is probably incapable of preventing recurrent herniation or adjacent segment degeneration.",1

METHODS: 165 patients were enrolled; 146 patients with a single level disc herniation (L2 to L5) were randomized: 75 investigational (herniectomy and DIAM) and 71 control (herniectomy alone) treated and followed up for 24 months. RESULTS: Significant improvements overtime (P < 0.001) in both groups but not significantly different between groups for visual analog scale (VAS) back pain at 6 months (investigational -3.97 ± 2.55 vs control-3.37 ± 3.15, P = 0.228) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 12 months (-38.55 ± 20.10 vs -37.19 ± 22.61, P = 0.719). For both outcomes, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups, at all postoperative time points. Although the enrolment ended before the intended sample size (308 patients) was reached, the number of patients reaching the VAS back pain minimally clinically important difference (MCID) of ?2.2 at 6 months was higher in the investigational (79.4 % vs control 57.1 %, P = 0.008). These results were sustained throughout 24 months (82.8 vs 64.4 %, P < 0.05). In average, surgical duration (P < 0.001), blood loss (P = 0.029) and skin incision (P < 0.001) in the investigational were 10 min longer, 22.5 ml greater and 2.0 cm wider than control group (median values). Improved tertiary outcomes from BL to 24 mo in both groups (investigational vs control): VAS leg pain (mean decrease -6.41 ± 2.57 to -6.41 vs -5.61 ± to -3.30); improved quality of life (SF-36: 20.68 ± 9.44 vs 16.90 ± 10.74); pain medication reduction: 56.7 vs 47.9 %; return to work: 45.7 vs 38.0 %. Adverse event rates: 68.5 % investigational and 66.2 % control. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized controlled trial to report equivalent efficacy and safety of herniectomy with or without DIAM spinal stabilizing device. Leg pain, back pain and the level of disability were not significantly different between groups; however, number of patients reaching the MCID for back pain was significantly higher in the investigational group at 6 through 24 months.",1

Devices to fuse the SIJ are now commercially available, but high-quality evidence supporting their effectiveness is limited.To compare the safety and effectiveness of conservative management (CM) to minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion (SIJF) in patients with chronic LBP originating from the SIJ.Prospective, multicenter randomized controlled trial.One hundred three adults in spine clinics with chronic LBP originating from the SIJ.Patients were randomly assigned to CM (n = 51) or SIJF using triangular titanium implants (n = 52). CM consisted of optimization of medical therapy, individualized physiotherapy, and adequate information and reassurance as part of a multifactorial treatment. The primary outcome was the difference in change in self-rated LBP at 6 months using a 0 - 100 visual analog scale (VAS). Other effectiveness and safety endpoints, including leg pain, disability using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), quality of life using EQ-5D, and SIJ function using active straight leg raise test (ASLR), were assessed up to 12 months.At 12 months, mean LBP improved by 41.6 VAS points in the SIJF group vs. 14.0 points in the CM group (treatment difference of 27.6 points, P < 0.0001). Mean ODI improved by 25.0 points in the SIJF group vs. 8.7 points in the CM group (P < 0.0001). Mean improvements in leg pain and EQ-5D scores were large after SIJF and superior to those after CM. CM patients were allowed to crossover to SIJF after 6 months. Patients who crossed to surgical treatment had no pre-crossover improvement in pain and ODI scores; after crossover, improvements were as large as those originally assigned to SIJF. One case of postoperative nerve impingement occurred in the surgical group. Two SIJF patients had recurrent pain attributed to possible device loosening and one had postoperative hematoma. In the CM group, one crossover surgery patient had recurrent pain requiring a revision surgery.The primary limitation was lack of blinding and the subjective nature of self-assessed outcomes.For patients with chronic LBP originating from the SIJ, minimally invasive SIJF with triangular titanium implants was safe and more effective than CM in relieving pain, reducing disability, and improving patient function and quality of life. Our findings will help to inform decisions regarding its use as a treatment option in this patient population.Key words: Sacroiliac joint dysfunction, pelvic girdle pain, randomized controlled trial, quality of life, spine implants.",1

Methods At 31 investigational sites, 541 patients with single-level cervical disc disease with radiculopathy were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups: 276 investigational group patients underwent anterior cervical discectomy and arthroplasty with the Prestige disc, and 265 control group patients underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Clinical outcomes included Neck Disability Index, the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and neck and arm pain scores. Radiographs were assessed for angle of motion and fusion. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were evaluated preoperatively, intraoperatively, and at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 60, and 84 months. Results Of the 541 patients treated, 395 patients (73%; 212 investigational and 183 control patients) completed 7 years of clinical follow-up. Significant improvements achieved by 1.5 months in both groups were sustained at 7 years. In the investigational group, mean Neck Disability Index improvements from preoperative scores were 38.2 and 37.5 at 60 and 84 months, respectively. In the control group, the corresponding means were 33.8 and 31.9. The differences between the investigational and control groups at the 60-month and 84-month periods were significant (p = 0.014 and 0.002, respectively). The overall rates of maintenance or improvement in neurological status in the investigational group were significantly higher: 92.2% and 88.2% at 60 months and 84 months, respectively, compared with 85.7% and 79.7% in the control group (p = 0.017 and 0.011, respectively). At 84 months, the percentage of working patients in the investigational group was 73.9%, and in the control group, 73.1%. Postoperatively, the implant effectively maintained average angular motion of 6.67° at 60 months and 6.75° at 84 months. Cumulative rates for surgery at the index level were lower (p &lt; 0.001) in the investigational group (11 [4.8%] of 276) when compared with the control group (29 [13.7%] of 265) (based on life-table method), and there were statistical differences between the investigational and control groups with specific regard to the rate of subsequent revision and supplemental fixation surgical procedures. Rates for additional surgical procedures that involved adjacent levels were lower in the investigational group than in the control group (11 [4.6%] of 276 vs 24 [11.9%] of 265, respectively).

Methods Five hundred forty-one patients with single-level cervical DDD and radiculopathy were enrolled at 32 sites and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 276 patients in the investigational group underwent anterior cervical discectomy and decompression and arthroplasty with the PRESTIGE ST Cervical Disc System (Medtronic Sofamor Danek); 265 patients in the control group underwent decompressive ACDF. Eighty percent of the arthroplasty-treated patients (223 of 276) and 75% of the control patients (198 of 265) completed clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations at routine intervals for 2 years after surgery. Analysis of all currently available postoperative 12- and 24-month data indicated a two-point greater improvement in the neck disability index score in the investigational group than the control group. The arthroplasty group also had a statistically significant higher rate of neurological success (p = 0.005) as well as a lower rate of secondary revision surgeries (p = 0.0277) and supplemental fixation (p = 0.0031). The mean improvement in the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Summary scores was greater in the investigational group at 12 and 24 months, as was relief of neck pain.

METHODS Patients from 30 investigational sites were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: investigational patients (209) underwent arthroplasty using a Prestige LP artificial disc, and control patients (188) underwent ACDF with a cortical ring allograft and anterior cervical plate. Patients were evaluated preoperatively, intraoperatively, and at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Efficacy and safety outcomes were measured according to the Neck Disability Index (NDI), Numeric Rating Scales for neck and arm pain, 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), gait abnormality, disc height, range of motion (investigational) or fusion (control), adverse events (AEs), additional surgeries, and neurological status. Treatment was considered an overall success when all 4 of the following criteria were met: 1) NDI score improvement of ≥ 15 points over the preoperative score, 2) maintenance or improvement in neurological status compared with preoperatively, 3) no serious AE caused by the implant or by the implant and surgical procedure, and 4) no additional surgery (supplemental fixation, revision, or nonelective implant removal). Independent statisticians performed Bayesian statistical analyses. RESULTS The 24-month rates of overall success were 81.4% for the investigational group and 69.4% for the control group. The posterior mean for overall success in the investigational group exceeded that in the control group by 0.112 (95% highest posterior density interval = 0.023 to 0.201) with a posterior probability of 1 for noninferiority and 0.993 for superiority, demonstrating the superiority of the investigational group for overall success. Noninferiority of the investigational group was demonstrated for all individual components of overall success and individual effectiveness end points, except for the SF-36 Mental Component Summary. The investigational group was superior to the control group for NDI success. The proportion of patients experiencing any AE was 93.3% (195/209) in the investigational group and 92.0% (173/188) in the control group, which were not statistically different. The rate of patients who reported any serious AE (Grade 3 or 4) was significantly higher in the control group (90 [47.9%] of 188) than in the investigational group (72 [34.4%] of 209) with a posterior probability of superiority of 0.996. Radiographic success was achieved in 51.0% (100/196) of the investigational patients (maintenance of motion without evidence of bridging bone) and 82.1% (119/145) of the control patients (fusion). At 24 months, heterotopic ossification was identified in 27.8% (55/198) of the superior levels and 36.4% (72/198) of the inferior levels of investigational patients.

To establish an evidence-based rationale for cervical TDR to serve as a viable alternative to ACDF, cervical arthroplasty must establish equivalent or superior clinical outcomes while maintaining motion. The authors report on 98 patients from a single investigational site involved in 3 separate prospective, randomized, controlled investigational device exemption multicenter trials comparing cervical arthroplasty to ACDF with a 2–6-year follow-up. Methods Patients with 1- and 2-level cervical disc disease producing radiculopathy and/or myelopathy were randomized prospectively under 3 separate investigational device exemption pivotal trials to undergo ACDF with plate or artificial disc placement. The 3 arthroplasty systems evaluated were the Bryan cervical disc, Kineflex/C disc, and Discover cervical disc. The patients were evaluated with pre- and postoperative serial neurological examinations, radiographs, and clinical outcome indices at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months.

Overall, angular motion was improved by 0.91° in the combined arthroplasty group and reduced by 7.8° in the combined ACDF group (p &lt; 0.0001). In the ACDF group there was a fusion rate of 97% (36 of 37 cases). In the arthroplasty group there was a 5.6% incidence of bridging heterotopic ossification (3 cases). There were a total of 4 reoperations (7.5%) in the combined arthroplasty group with 1 (1.9%) at the adjacent level. There were 3 reoperations (8.1%) in the ACDF group, all at the adjacent level. Conclusions The prospective, intermediate-term (average follow-up &gt; 3 years) results of cervical TDR at the authors' site are encouraging. Patients treated with the artificial discs showed significantly better clinical results, maintained motion at the treated level, and trended toward less adjacent-level disease.",1

This ""gold-standard"" technique has demonstrated good clinical and radiographic outcomes. Common adverse effects of this procedure are associated with the adjacent level degeneration and bone-graft harvest. Several investigators have independently reported successful short-term outcomes with the BRYAN Cervical Disc Prosthesis. In addition, a significant body of knowledge has been collected regarding the wear patterns and adjacent level effects of this device in human and animal models.As part of an FDA IDE trial, 3 centers collected prospective outcomes data on 115 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio to ACDF (Control group) or arthroplasty with the BRYAN Cervical Disc Prosthesis (Investigational group).Demographic and surgical data were generally similar in the 2 populations. Outcomes data collected at routine postoperative intervals for 24 months demonstrated that the Investigational group had statistically significant (P<0.05) improvements as assessed by the Neck Disability Index, the Neck Pain Score, and SF-36 Physical component scores. The improvement in the Mental Component Subscore values for the BRYAN and control groups was equivalent at 24 months (P=0.055). Arm pain relief was similar in both groups (P=0.152). During the course of the 2-year follow-up, 4 patients in the Control group required surgical intervention and 3 patients in the Investigational group required ACDF for adjacent level disease.At 24 months, cervical arthroplasty with the BRYAN Cervical Disc Prosthesis compares favorably with ACDF as defined by standard outcomes scores.",1

Level 1 evidence.To report functional outcomes at 48 months follow-up on prospectively randomized patients to either the Bryan cervical disc prosthesis or anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) at a single site.Surgical treatment of cervical disc pathology can involve discectomy and fusion (ACDF), the gold standard technique. The safety and effectiveness of this procedure has been established and demonstrated in the literature, however, limitations have evolved and alternatives such as disc replacement are being investigated. Intervertebral disc replacement is designed to preserve motion, both at affected and adjacent levels avoiding limitations of fusion such as adjacent level degeneration. New onset degenerative changes and possible recurring neurologic symptoms may be deferred or eliminated with cervical disc replacement. A recent multicenter trial with 24 months follow-up has shown the Bryan disc to compare favorably with ACDF. Continued follow-up is needed to further evaluate and compare functional outcomes in both these cohorts.A total of 47 patients were enrolled at our site as part of an ongoing multicenter prospectively randomized study investigating ACDF versus Bryan cervical disc prosthesis. Functional outcomes are now reported at 48 months follow-up for our cohort of participants. Neck disability index score (NDI), VAS neck and arm and SF-36 both physical and mental as well as complications and reoperations will be reported.Functional outcome data collected at routine follow-up for 48-months has favorably demonstrated improved functional outcomes for NDI, neck/arm pain VAS scores, and the SF-36 physical/mental health component scores for the Bryan arthroplasty and ACDF cohorts. The NDI scores for the Bryan arthroplasty preoperatively was 51 and at 48 months 10. For ACDF preoperative NDI score was also 51 and at 48 months 16.7. At 48 months NDI success, measured by >or=15 points NDI improvement demonstrated a 93.3% success for Bryan arthroplasty and an 82.4% success for ACDF. VAS neck pain scores for the Bryan arthroplasty preoperatively was 76.2 and at 48 months was 13.6. VAS neck pain scores for ACDF preoperatively was 80.6 and at 48 months was 28.1. Arm Pain scores were also measured and for the Bryan arthroplasty preoperatively measured 78.8 and at 48 months 10.8. For ACDF arm pain scores preoperatively measured 77.1 and at 48 months 21.7. These outcomes have not been associated with any degradation of outcome measures from 2 to 4 years. During the 48 months of follow-up at our institution we also report 6 secondary surgeries in our control group (ACDF) and only 1 in our investigational group (Bryan). Of the 6 surgeries in the control group performed, 3 or 12% to date were for adjacent level degenerative disease and 1 or 4% for remote level degenerative disc disease. The remaining 2 surgeries were performed on the same patient for a pseudarthrosis. In the investigational group there was only 1 secondary surgery performed to date for adjacent level disease 5%.At 48 months, cervical arthroplasty with the Bryan cervical disc prosthesis continues to compare favorably to ACDF at our institution. There has been no degradation of functional outcomes from 24 to 48 months for NDI, VAS of neck and arm, and SF-36. There has been a lower incidence of secondary surgeries for the Bryan arthroplasty cohort to date.",1

Previous studies have evaluated the efficacy of this alternative without the scientific rigor of a concurrent control population. This study is a pooled data set from 3 centers involved in the U.S. FDA Investigational Device Exemption trial evaluating the Bryan artificial cervical disc.The purpose of this study is to examine the functional outcome and radiographic results of this prospective, randomized trial to determine the role of the Bryan artificial cervical disc replacement for patients with 1-level cervical disc disease; 12-month follow-up is available for 110 patients and 24 month follow-up complete for 99 patients. There are 30 males and 26 females in the Bryan group and 32 males and 27 females in the fusion group. The average age was 43 years (Bryan) and 46 years (fusion). Disability and pain were assessed using the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of the neck and of the arm pain. SF-36 outcome measures were obtained including the physical component as well as the mental component scores. Range of motion was determined by independent radiologic assessment of flexion-extension radiographs. We report a prospective, randomized study comparing the functional outcome of cervical disc replacement to an anterior cervical fusion with results of 99 patients at 2 years. Prospective data were collected before surgery and at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery.The average operative time for the control group was 1.1 hours and the Bryan Group 1.7 hours. Average blood loss was 49 mL (control) and 64 mL (Bryan). Average hospital stay was 0.6 days (control) and 0.9 days (Bryan). The mean NDI before surgery was not statistically different between groups: 47 (Bryan) and 49 (control). Twelve-month follow-up NDI is 10 (Bryan) and 18 (control) (P = 0.013). At 2-year follow-up, NDI for the Bryan group is 11 and the control group is 20 (P = 0.005). The mean arm pain VAS before surgery was 70 (Bryan) and 71 (control). At 1-year follow-up, Bryan arm pain VAS was 12 and control 23 (P = 0.031). At 2-year follow-up, the average arm pain VAS for the Bryan group was 14 and control 28 (P = 0.014). The mean neck pain VAS before surgery was 72 (Bryan) and 73 (control). One-year follow-up scores were 17 (Bryan) and 28 (control) (P = 0.05). At 2 years: 16 (Bryan) and 32 (control) (P = 0.005). SF-36 scores: Physical component--Before surgery Bryan 34 and control 32. At 24 months: Bryan 51 and control 46 (P = 0.009). More motion was retained after surgery in the disc replacement group than the plated group at the index level (P < 0.006 at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months). The disc replacement group retained an average of 7.9 degrees of flexion-extension at 24 months. In contrast, the average range of motion in the fusion group was 0.6 degrees at 24 months. There were 6 additional operations in this series: 4 in the control group and 2 in the investigational group. There were no intraoperative complications, no vascular or neurologic complications, no spontaneous fusions, and no device failures or explantations in the Bryan cohort.The Bryan artificial disc replacement compares favorably to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for the treatment of patients with 1-level cervical disc disease. At the 2-year follow-up, there are statistically significant differences between the groups with improvements in the NDI, the neck pain and arm pain VAS scores, and the SF-36 physical component score in the Bryan disc population.",1

Few of these trials, however, blinded the patients. We, therefore, conducted the Norwegian Cervical Arthroplasty Trial, and present 2-year clinical outcome after arthroplasty or fusion. Methods This multicenter trial included 136 patients with single-level cervical disc disease. The patients were randomized to arthroplasty or fusion, and blinded to the treatment modality. The surgical team was blinded to randomization until nerve root decompression was completed. Primary outcome was the self-rated Neck Disability Index. Secondary outcomes were the numeric rating scale for pain and quality of life questionnaires Short Form-36 and EuroQol-5Dimension-3 Level. Results There was a significant improvement in the primary and all secondary outcomes from baseline to 2-year follow-up for both arthroplasty and fusion ( P &lt; 0.001), and no observed significant between-group differences at any follow-up times. However, linear mixed model analyses, correcting for baseline values, dropouts and missing data, revealed a difference in Neck Disability Index ( P = 0.049), and arm pain ( P = 0.027) in favor of fusion at 2 years. The duration of surgery was longer ( P &lt; 0.001), and the frequency of reoperations higher ( P = 0.029) with arthroplasty. Conclusion The present study showed excellent clinical results and no significant difference between treatments at any scheduled follow-up.

There has therefore been a call to compare outcomes between different arthroplasty implants. We report the clinical outcomes, at 2-years follow-up, of a randomized controlled trial comparing two fundamentally different implants—the NUNEC Cervical Arthroplasty System (RTI Surgical, Inc., Florida, United States), is a PEEK on PEEK articulating device with inferior ball and superior trough secured by cam lock screws and the PRESTIGE LP Cervical Disc System (Medtronic, Minnesota, United States), is a titanium ceramic composite articulating device with superior ball and inferior trough secured by keels. Material and Methods A review of 52 patients with symptomatic degenerative disc disease causing cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy enrolled in this United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) Research Ethics Committee approved study has been performed. Preoperatively patients were randomized into the two treatment groups (surgery with NUNEC Cervical Arthroplasty System or PRESTIGE LP Cervical Disc System) and blinded until after surgery. All procedures were performed by or under direct supervision of two senior surgeons at the host institution. Patient reported outcome measures (neck disability index (NDI), visual analogue scale (VAS) for arm and neck pain and hospital anxiety and depression scale) were collected preoperatively and at follow-up. Surgical time, blood loss, and complications have also been reviewed. Outcomes have been compared between groups. Results Data for 47 patients is reported (1 withdrawal due to relocation, 4 nonattendance at follow-up excluded). There were 51 NUNEC implants used (3 one level, 12 two level, 4 three level, and 3 four level) and 52 PRESTIGE LP implants used (6 one level, 12 two level, 6 three level, and 1 four level). There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of the number of operated levels between the two implant groups and therefore analysis of data has been performed using the means for each group. There was no statistically significant difference in the preoperative outcome scores or demographics between the groups. In the NUNEC group NDI improved from 49 to 45.6, VAS neck from 7.5 to 4.7, VAS arms from 7.2 to 4, depression from 8.5 to 8.3, and anxiety from 9.2 to 8.6. In the PRESTIGE LP group NDI improved from 56 to 44, VAS neck from 7.2 to 4.5, VAS arms from 6.4 to 4.5, depression from 9.1 to 8, and anxiety from 9.5 to 9.2. There was no statistically significant difference in the postoperative outcomes between the groups. There were no reoperations in either group for ASD. Conclusion There has been a call for studies comparing different CDA implants. We report the outcomes at 2 years of a randomized controlled trial comparing the NUNEC cervical arthroplasty system and the PRESTIGE LP cervical disc system. No statistically significant difference was found in outcome measures between the two implants.

Both Bryan disc arthroplasty with modified techniques and ProDisc-C arthroplasty were reported to avoid the postoperative local kyphosis. There have been no studies comparing the alignment changes after Bryan disc arthroplasty with ProDisc-C arthroplasty.We conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial enrolling patients with cervical disc disease. Ultimately 20 patients received Bryan disc arthroplasty with modified surgical techniques and 26 patients received ProDisc-C arthroplasty. Functional spinal unit (FSU) and overall cervical alignment (Cobb angle of C2/7) were compared at final follow-up.(1) FSU angle: the FSU angle was maintained for the Bryan disc group (from 0.8 to 0.6 degrees) without statistical significance; the FSU angle increased 2.9 degrees for the ProDisc-C group (from -0.3 to 2.6 degrees) with statistical significance. (2) Overall alignment: the overall alignments did not change for both Bryan disc and ProDisc-C groups.Bryan disc arthroplasty with modified techniques can maintain the lordosis of FSU, whereas ProDisc-C arthroplasty can restore the lordosis of FSU.

Objective To prospectively examine the 7- and 10-year outcomes of cervical arthroplasty to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Summary of background data Degeneration of the cervical discs causing radiculopathy is a frequent source of surgical intervention, commonly treated with ACDF. Positive clinical outcomes are associated with arthrodesis techniques, yet there remains a long-term concern for adjacent segment change. Cervical disc arthroplasty has been designed to mitigate some of the challenges associated with arthrodesis whereas providing for a similar positive neurological outcome. As data has been collected from numerous prospective US FDA IDE trials, longer term outcomes regarding adjacent segment change may be examined. Methods As part of an FDA IDE trial, a single center collected prospective outcomes data on 47 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio to ACDF or arthroplasty. Results Success of both surgical interventions remained high at the 10-year interval. Both arthrodesis and arthroplasty demonstrated statistically significant improvements in neck disability index, visual analog scale neck and arm pain scores at all intervals including 7- and 10-year periods. Arthroplasty demonstrated an advantage in comparison to arthrodesis as measured by final 10-year NDI score (8 vs. 16, P = 0.0485). Patients requiring reoperation were higher in number in the arthrodesis cohort (32%) in comparison with arthroplasty (9%) (P = 0.055). Conclusion At 7 and 10 years, cervical arthroplasty compares favorably with ACDF as defined by standard outcomes scores in a highly selected population with radiculopathy. Level of evidence 1.",1

METHODS A prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter FDA-approved clinical trial was conducted at 30 US centers, comparing the low-profile titanium ceramic composite-based Prestige LP ADR (n = 209) at 2 levels with ACDF (n = 188). Clinical and radiographic evaluations were completed preoperatively, intraoperatively, and at regular postoperative intervals to 84 months. The primary end point was overall success, a composite variable that included key safety and efficacy considerations. RESULTS At 84 months, the Prestige LP ADR demonstrated statistical superiority over fusion for overall success (observed rate 78.6% vs 62.7%; posterior probability of superiority [PPS] = 99.8%), Neck Disability Index success (87.0% vs 75.6%; PPS = 99.3%), and neurological success (91.6% vs 82.1%; PPS = 99.0%). All other study effectiveness measures were at least noninferior for ADR compared with ACDF. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall rate of implant-related or implant/surgical procedure–related adverse events up to 84 months (26.6% and 27.7%, respectively). However, the Prestige LP group had fewer serious (Grade 3 or 4) implant- or implant/surgical procedure–related adverse events (3.2% vs 7.2%, log hazard ratio [LHR] and 95% Bayesian credible interval [95% BCI] −1.19 [−2.29 to −0.15]). Patients in the Prestige LP group also underwent statistically significantly fewer second surgical procedures at the index levels (4.2%) than the fusion group (14.7%) (LHR −1.29 [95% BCI −2.12 to −0.46]). Angular range of motion at superior- and inferior-treated levels on average was maintained in the Prestige LP ADR group to 84 months. CONCLUSIONS The low-profile artificial cervical disc in this study, Prestige LP, implanted at 2 adjacent levels, maintains improved clinical outcomes and segmental motion 84 months after surgery and is a safe and effective alternative to fusion.

Current cervical total disc replacement designs incorporate constrained and unconstrained metal-on-metal or metal-on-polymer articulating designs with various means of fixation.A total of 380 patients from 18 investigational sites were prospectively enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized, treated surgically, and evaluated postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. Clinical outcomes include overall success, visual analogue scale pain (right arm, left arm, and neck), neck disability index, neurological status, Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Status Survey questionnaires, range of motion, and adverse events. Bayesian statistical methods were used to analyze the outcomes.Overall success results demonstrated statistical superiority of the randomized SECURE-C group compared with the randomized ACDF group at 24 months, with a posterior probability of 100% using the protocol-specified criteria and 98.1% using Food and Drug Administration-defined criteria. At 24 months postoperatively, SECURE-C demonstrated clinically significant improvement in pain and function in terms of neck disability index, visual analogue scale, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. At 24 months, the percentage of patients experiencing secondary surgical interventions at the index level was statistically lower for the SECURE-C group (2.5%) than the ACDF group (9.7%). At 24 months, 84.6% of as-treated SECURE-C patients were range-of-motion successes. Satisfaction was high among SECURE-C patients.The selectively constrained SECURE-C Cervical Artificial Disc is as safe and effective as the standard of care, an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. SECURE-C is statistically superior in terms of overall success, index-level subsequent surgical procedures, and patient satisfaction, making it an attractive surgical option for patients with symptomatic cervical disc disease.1.",1

Although the long-term outcome of single-level disc replacement has been extensively described, there have not been previous reports of the 5-year outcome of 2-level cervical disc replacement. METHODS This study reports the 5-year results of a prospective, randomized US FDA investigational device exemption (IDE) study conducted at 24 centers in patients with 2-level, contiguous, cervical spondylosis. Clinical outcomes at up to 60 months were evaluated, including validated outcome measures, incidence of reoperation, and adverse events. The complete study data and methodology were critically reviewed by 3 independent surgeon authors without affiliation with the IDE study or financial or institutional bias toward the study sponsor. RESULTS A total of 225 patients received the Mobi-C cervical total disc replacement device and 105 patients received ACDF. The Mobi-C and ACDF follow-up rates were 90.7% and 86.7%, respectively (p = 0.39), at 60 months. There was significant improvement in all outcome scores relative to baseline at all time points. The Mobi-C patients had significantly more improvement than ACDF patients in terms of Neck Disability Index score, SF-12 Physical Component Summary, and overall satisfaction with treatment at 60 months. The reoperation rate was significantly lower with Mobi-C (4%) versus ACDF (16%). There were no significant differences in the adverse event rate between groups. CONCLUSIONS Both cervical total disc replacement and ACDF significantly improved general and disease-specific measures compared with baseline. However, there was significantly greater improvement in general and disease-specific outcome measures and a lower rate of reoperation in the 2-level disc replacement patients versus ACDF control patients.

METHODS A prospective randomized, US FDA investigational device exemption pivotal trial of the Mobi-C cervical artificial disc was conducted at 24 centers in the US. Three hundred thirty patients with degenerative disc disease were randomized and treated with cervical total disc replacement (225 patients) or the control treatment, anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) (105 patients). Patients were followed up at regular intervals for 4 years after surgery. RESULTS At 48 months, both groups demonstrated improvement in clinical outcome measures and a comparable safety profile. Data were available for 202 TDR patients and 89 ACDF patients in calculation of the primary endpoint. TDR patients had statistically significantly greater improvement than ACDF patients for the following outcome measures compared with baseline: Neck Disability Index scores, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Summary scores, patient satisfaction, and overall success. ACDF patients experienced higher subsequent surgery rates and displayed a higher rate of adjacent-segment degeneration as seen on radiographs.

Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has been the standard treatment for these indications since the procedure was first developed in the 1950s. While TDR has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative to ACDF for treatment of patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD) at a single level of the cervical spine, few studies have focused on the safety and efficacy of TDR for treatment of 2 levels of the cervical spine. The primary objective of this study was to rigorously compare the Mobi-C cervical artificial disc to ACDF for treatment of cervical DDD at 2 contiguous levels of the cervical spine. Methods This study was a prospective, randomized, US FDA investigational device exemption pivotal trial of the Mobi-C cervical artificial disc conducted at 24 centers in the US. The primary clinical outcome was a composite measure of study success at 24 months. The comparative control treatment was ACDF using allograft bone and an anterior plate. A total of 330 patients were enrolled, randomized, and received study surgery. All patients were diagnosed with intractable symptomatic cervical DDD at 2 contiguous levels of the cervical spine between C-3 and C-7. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio (TDR patients to ACDF patients). Results A total of 225 patients received the Mobi-C TDR device and 105 patients received ACDF. At 24 months only 3.0% of patients were lost to follow-up. On average, patients in both groups showed significant improvements in Neck Disability Index (NDI) score, visual analog scale (VAS) neck pain score, and VAS arm pain score from preoperative baseline to each time point. However, the TDR patients experienced significantly greater improvement than ACDF patients in NDI score at all time points and significantly greater improvement in VAS neck pain score at 6 weeks, and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. On average, patients in the TDR group also maintained preoperative segmental range of motion at both treated segments immediately postoperatively and throughout the study period of 24 months. The reoperation rate was significantly higher in the ACDF group at 11.4% compared with 3.1% for the TDR group. Furthermore, at 24 months TDR demonstrated statistical superiority over ACDF based on overall study success rates. Conclusions The results of this study represent the first available Level I clinical evidence in support of cervical arthroplasty at 2 contiguous levels of the cervical spine using the Mobi-C cervical artificial disc. These results continue to support the use of cervical arthroplasty in general, but specifically demonstrate the advantages of 2-level arthroplasty over 2-level ACDF.

Data were collected pre- and perioperatively at 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following surgery. The key clinical outcome measures were a Visual Analog Scale assessing back pain, the Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire, and the SF-36 Health Survey.Patients in both groups improved significantly following surgery. Patients in the CHARITE artificial disc group recovered faster than patients in the control group. Patients in the CHARITE artificial disc group had lower levels of disability at every time interval from 6 weeks to 24 months, compared with the control group, with statistically lower pain and disability scores at all but the 24 month follow-up (P < 0.05). At the 24-month follow-up period, a significantly greater percentage of patients in the CHARITE artificial disc group expressed satisfaction with their treatment and would have the same treatment again, compared with the fusion group (P < 0.05). The hospital stay was significantly shorter in the CHARITE artificial disc group (P < 0.05). The complication rate was similar between both groups.This prospective, randomized, multicenter study demonstrated that quantitative clinical outcome measures following lumbar total disc replacement with the CHARITE artificial disc are at least equivalent to clinical outcomes with anterior lumbar interbody fusion. These results support earlier reports in the literature that total disc replacement with the CHARITE artificial disc is a safe and effective alternative to fusion for the surgical treatment of symptomatic disc degeneration in properly indicated patients. The CHARITE artificial disc group demonstrated statistically significant superiority in two major economic areas, a 1-day shorter hospitalization, and a lower rate of reoperations (5.4% compared with 9.1%).

Results for various TDRs seem to be similar, but differences in study design and outcome measures pose challenges in definitively comparing devices. The purpose of this study was to perform a direct comparison of 2 lumbar TDRs in a prospective, randomized trial.TDR was performed in 457 patients from 21 sites (261 patients in the investigational group (Kineflex-L Disc; metal-on-metal design anchored with keels, 204 randomized and 57 nonrandomized training cases), and 196 in the control group (CHARITE artificial disc; metal with polyethylene core with teeth for anchoring; 190 randomized and 6 nonrandomized training cases). All patients were treated nonoperatively for single-level symptomatic disc degeneration for at least 6 months prior to surgery. Perioperative data were collected. Clinical outcome data were collected prospectively, as approved by the Food and Drug Administration, through 24-month follow-up. Primary outcome measures used were the Oswestry Disability Index, visual analogue scales assessing pain, patient satisfaction, and reoperations. Success was defined to be at least 15-point improvements in Oswestry Disability Index scores, no reoperation, and no major adverse events. Radiographical measures included range of motion, disc space height, and assessment for device migration, subsidence, and fusion at the TDR level.There were no significant differences between the groups when comparing operative time, blood loss, or length of hospital stay. Both groups improved significantly on Oswestry Disability Index and visual analogue scale scores (P < 0.01) with no differences between the groups. Success rates were similar (68.1% investigational vs. 67.4% control). At 24-month follow-up, 94.1% of the investigational group and 91.9% of controls were satisfied with outcome.

Subjects were randomized to receive laminectomy and Coflex interlaminar stabilization or laminectomy and posterolateral spinal fusion with spinal instrumentation in a 2:1 ratio. Overall device success required a 15-point reduction in Oswestry Disability Index, no reoperations, no major device-related complications, and no postoperative epidural injections.Patient follow-up at minimum 2 years was 95.3% and 97.2% in the Coflex and fusion control groups, respectively. Patients taking Coflex experienced significantly shorter operative times (P < 0.0001), blood loss (P < 0.0001), and length of stay (P < 0.0001). There was a trend toward greater improvement in mean Oswestry Disability Index scores in the Coflex cohort (P = 0.075). Both groups demonstrated significant improvement from baseline in all visual analogue scale back and leg parameters. Patients taking Coflex experienced greater improvement in Short-Form 12 physical health outcomes (P = 0.050) and equivalent mental health outcomes. Coflex subjects experienced significant improvement in all Zurich Claudication Questionnaire outcomes measures compared with fusion (symptom severity [P = 0.023]; physical function [P = 0.008]; satisfaction [P = 0.006]). Based on the Food and Drug Administration composite for overall success, 66.2% of Coflex and 57.7% of fusions succeeded (P = 0.999), thus demonstrating noninferiority. The overall adverse event rate was similar between the groups, but Coflex had a higher reoperation rate (10.7% vs. 7.5%, P = 0.426). At 2 years, fusions exhibited increased angulation (P = 0.002) and a trend toward increased translation (P = 0.083) at the superior adjacent level, whereas Coflex maintained normal operative and adjacent level motion.Coflex interlaminar stabilization is a safe and efficacious alternative, with certain advantages compared with lumbar spinal fusion in the treatment of spinal stenosis and low-grade spondylolisthesis.1.",1

The object of the current study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of coflex Interlaminar Stabilization compared with PSF to treat low-grade spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis. Methods This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter FDA investigational device exemption (IDE) trial comparing coflex Interlaminar Stabilization with laminectomy and PSF. A total of 322 patients from 21 sites in the US were enrolled between 2006 and 2008 for the IDE trial. The current study evaluated only the subset of patients from this overall cohort with Grade 1 spondylolisthesis (99 in the coflex group and 51 in the fusion group). Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive decompression and coflex interlaminar stabilization or decompression and posterolateral spinal fusion with spinal instrumentation. Data collected included perioperative outcomes, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), back and worse leg visual analog scale (VAS) scores, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey, Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ), and radiographic outcomes at a minimum of 2 years. The FDA criteria for overall device success required the following to be met: 15-point reduction in ODI, no reoperations, no major device-related complications, and no postoperative epidural injections. Results At a minimum of 2 years, patient follow-up was 94.9% and 94.1% in the coflex and fusion control groups, respectively. There were no group differences at baseline for any demographic, clinical, or radiographic parameter. The average age was 63 years in the coflex cohort and 65 years in the fusion cohort. Coflex subjects experienced significantly shorter operative times (p &lt; 0.0001), less estimated blood loss (p &lt; 0.0001), and shorter length of stay (p &lt; 0.0001) than fusion controls. Both groups experienced significant improvements from baseline at 2 years in ODI, VAS back, VAS leg, and ZCQ, with no significant group differences, with the exception of significantly greater ZCQ satisfaction with coflex at 2 years. FDA overall success was achieved in 62.8% of coflex subjects (59 of 94) and 62.5% of fusion controls (30 of 48) (p = 1.000). The reoperation rate was higher in the coflex cohort (14 [14.1%] of 99) compared with fusion (3 [5.9%] of 51, p = 0.18), although this difference was not statistically significant. Fusion was associated with significantly greater angulation and translation at the superior and inferior adjacent levels compared with baseline, while coflex showed no significant radiographic changes at the operative or index levels. Conclusions Low-grade spondylolisthesis was effectively stabilized by coflex and led to similar clinical outcomes, with improved perioperative outcomes, compared with PSF at 2 years. Reoperation rates, however, were higher in the coflex cohort. Patients in the fusion cohort experienced significantly increased superior and inferior level angulation and translation, while those in the coflex cohort experienced no significant adjacent or index level radiographic changes from baseline. Coflex Interlaminar Stabilization is a less invasive, safe, and equally efficacious clinical solution to PSF to treat low-grade spondylolisthesis, and it appears to reduce stresses at the adjacent levels.

Adverse events and secondary surgical procedures are reported on the cohorts through current follow-up, which include 110 patients (68 PCM, 42 ACDF) at 7 years.At 5 years postoperative, all patient-reported outcomes-neck and arm pain visual analogue scale score, neck disability index, and general health (36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical and mental component scores: physical component summary, mental component summary)-were significantly improved from baselines in both groups, and mean scores were significantly better in the PCM group for neck disability index (P=0.001), neck pain (P=0.002), general health (Pphysical component summary=0.014; Pmental component summary=0.004), and patient satisfaction (P=0.005). PCM patients trended toward fewer 2- to 7-year device-related serious adverse events (1/214, 0.5% PCM; 2/190, 1.1% ACDF) and secondary surgical procedures (7/211, 3.3% PCM; 14/290, 7.6% ACDF). Adjacent-level degeneration was radiographically more frequent after ACDF (33.1% PCM, 50.9% ACDF; P=0.006) and was the primary indication for the increase in late-term secondary surgical procedures after ACDF.The long-term results show good clinical outcomes after ACDF and PCM arthroplasty. PCM patients showed greater improvement in neck disability index and neck pain scores with a lower rate of radiographical adjacent-level degeneration and a trend toward fewer secondary surgical procedures. These data support PCM arthroplasty to be a viable and sustainable alternative to ACDF.1.",1

The PCM Cervical Disc is a nonconstrained motion-sparing alternative to ACDF.Patients 18 to 65 years of age with single-level symptomatic cervical spondylosis with radiculopathy and/or myelopathy unresponsive to nonoperative treatment were enrolled, including patients with prior nonadjacent or adjacent single-level fusions. The per-protocol patient sample at 2 years included 342 patients (189 PCM, 153 ACDF). Longitudinal outcomes were comparatively evaluated.At 2 years postoperatively, clinical measures-neck and arm pain visual analogue scale, Neck Disability Index (NDI), SF-36, and neurological status-were significantly improved from preoperative baselines in both groups. Mean NDI score at 2 years was significantly lower in PCM group (P = 0.029). There were no statistical differences between groups in rates of surgery-related serious adverse events (5.6% PCM, 7.4% ACDF) or secondary surgical procedures (5.2% PCM, 5.4% ACDF). Patients with PCM reported lower dysphagia scores (8.8/100 vs. 12.1/100; P = 0.045) and higher patient satisfaction (82.8/100 vs. 81.4/100). Overall success, a composite endpoint including minimum 20% NDI improvement, no major complications, no neurological worsening, no secondary surgical procedures, and meeting radiographical criteria of motion for PCM and fusion for ACDF, was significantly greater in the PCM group (75.1% vs. 64.9%; P = 0.020).The treatment of symptomatic single-level cervical spondylosis with PCM achieves clinical outcomes that are at least equivalent to ACDF while maintaining motion. At 2 years, patients with PCM had lower NDI scores, statistically lower rate of prolonged dysphagia, greater patient satisfaction, and superior overall success.",1

The dysphagia data for both PCM and anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) patients were reviewed from 5 centers to (1) compare the severity of dysphagia, (2) compare the postoperative incidence of dysphagia, and (3) to compare the resolution of perioperative dysphagia.Dysphagia and dysphonia after anterior surgical approaches to the cervical spine have been previously reported. The current prospective, randomized investigation quantifies clinical dysphagia based on 3 criteria-severity, incidence, and resolution-in a time-course evaluation.Patients between 18 and 65 years with 1-level symptomatic cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy for progressive neurologic symptoms, were randomized to undergo anterior decompression and PCM arthroplasty (N=151) or ACDF (control) (N=100). Patients self-reported dysphagia severity using the Bazaz scale preoperatively and at follow-up. The Bazaz scale has 4 classes of severity based upon the problems with swallowing that the patient has with both liquids and solids.The Bazaz results demonstrate that although both the PCM and ACDF groups exhibited an initial postoperative problem with swallowing, the PCM group continued to improve with increasing time after implantation, whereas the ACDF only improved minimally. The PCM treatments indicated significantly lower incidence of dysphagia at 3 and 12 months postoperatively compared with ACDF controls (P<0.05). An increase in dysphagia severity at either the 6-week or 3-month follow-up visit was reported in 35 (42%) PCM and 29 (64%) ACDF subjects. Long-term resolution of these symptoms was noted in 74% (26/35) of the PCM subjects as compared with 41.4% (12/29) of the ACDF subjects (P=0.015).In a prospective randomized clinical study the incidence of postoperative dysphagia and the long-term resolution of the dysphagia was greatly improved in the PCM group compared with the instrumented ACDF control group.",1

In addition to preserving motion, evidence suggests that cervical TDR may result in a lower incidence of subsequent surgical intervention than treatment with fusion. The goal of this study was to evaluate subsequent surgery rates up to 5 years in patients treated with TDR or ACDF at 1 or 2 contiguous levels between C-3 and C-7. METHODS This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, unblinded clinical trial. Patients with symptomatic degenerative disc disease were enrolled to receive 1- or 2-level treatment with either TDR as the investigational device or ACDF as the control treatment. There were 260 patients in the 1-level study (179 TDR and 81 ACDF patients) and 339 patients in the 2-level study (234 TDR and 105 ACDF patients). RESULTS At 5 years, the occurrence of subsequent surgical intervention was significantly higher among ACDF patients for 1-level (TDR, 4.5% [8/179]; ACDF, 17.3% [14/81]; p = 0.0012) and 2-level (TDR, 7.3% [17/234]; ACDF, 21.0% [22/105], p = 0.0007) treatment. The TDR group demonstrated significantly fewer index- and adjacent-level subsequent surgeries in both the 1- and 2-level cohorts. CONCLUSIONS Five-year results showed treatment with cervical TDR to result in a significantly lower rate of subsequent surgical intervention than treatment with ACDF for both 1 and 2 levels of treatment.

Results including neck disability index, visual analog scale (VAS) neck and arm pain, Short Form-36 (SF-36), neurological examination, device success, adverse event occurrence, and VAS patient satisfaction were analyzed.Demographics were similar between the 2 patient groups (ProDisc-C: 42.1 ± 8.4 yr, 44.7% males; ACDF: 43.5 ± 7.1 yr, 46.2% males). Rates of follow-up at 2 years were 98.1% ProDisc-C and 94.8% ACDF, and at 5 years 72.7% ProDisc-C and 63.5% ACDF. For all clinical outcomes for both groups, there was a statistically and clinically significant improvement at 2 and 5 years compared with baseline. At 5 years, ProDisc-C patients had statistically significantly less neck pain intensity and frequency. Both groups scored high VAS satisfaction scores at 5 years, with ProDisc-C 86.56 and ACDF 82.74. There were no reports of device failures or implant migration with ProDisc-C. The ProDisc-C patients maintained motion at their index level. At 5 years, the ProDisc-C patients had a statistically significantly lower rate of reoperation compared with ACDF patients (2.9% vs. 11.3%).Five-year results show that TDR with ProDisc-C is a safe and effective treatment of single-level symptomatic cervical disc disease. Clinical outcomes were comparable with ACDF. ProDisc-C patients maintained motion at the index level and had significantly less neck pain intensity and frequency as well as a lower probability of secondary surgery.",1

METHODS: We report on the single-site results from a larger multicenter trial of 13 sites using an approved US Food and Drug Administration protocol (prospective, randomized controlled non-inferiority design). Patients were randomized one-to-one to either the ProDisc-C device or ACDF. All enrollees were evaluated pre- and post-operatively at regular intervals through month 84. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for neck and arm pain/intensity, Neck Disability Index (NDI), Short-Form 36 (SF-36), and satisfaction were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were randomized to each arm of the study. Nineteen additional patients received the ProDisc-C via continued access. NDI improved with the ProDisc-C more than with ACDF. Total range of motion was maintained with the ProDisc-C, but diminished with ACDF. Neck and arm pain improved more in the ProDisc-C than ACDF group. Patient satisfaction remained higher in the ProDisc-C group at 7 years. SF-36 scores were higher in the TDA group than ACDF group at 7 years; the difference was not clinically significant. Six additional operations (two at the same level; four at an adjacent level) were performed in the ACDF, but none in the ProDisc-C group. CONCLUSIONS: The ProDisc-C implant appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of SCDD. Patients with the implant retained motion at the involved segment and had a lower reoperation rate than those with an ACDF.",1

A noninferiority design with a 1:1 randomization was used. <h3>Patient sample</h3> Two hundred nine patients were randomized and treated (106 ACDF; 103 ProDisc-C). <h3>Outcome measures</h3> Visual analog scale (VAS) pain and intensity (neck and arm), VAS satisfaction, neck disability index (NDI), neurological exam, device success, adverse event occurrence, and short form-36 (SF-36) standardized questionnaires. <h3>Methods</h3> A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial was performed. Patients were enrolled and treated in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved protocol. Patients were assessed pre– and postoperatively at six weeks, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. <h3>Results</h3> Demographics were similar between the two patient groups (ProDisc-C: 42.1±8.4 years, 44.7% males; Fusion: 43.5 ± 7.1 years, 46.2% males). The most commonly treated level was C5–C6 (ProDisc-C: 56.3%; Fusion=57.5%). NDI and SF-36 scores were significantly less compared with presurgery scores at all follow-up visits for both the treatment groups (p<.0001). VAS neck pain intensity and frequency as well as VAS arm pain intensity and frequency were statistically lower at all follow-up timepoints compared with preoperative levels (p<.0001) but were not different between treatments. Neurologic success (improvement or maintenance) was achieved at 24 months in 90.9% of ProDisc-C and 88.0% of Fusion patients (p=.638). Results show that at 24 months postoperatively, 84.4% of ProDisc-C patients achieved a more than or equal to 4° of motion or maintained motion relative to preoperative baseline at the operated level. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of secondary surgeries with 8.5% of Fusion patients needing a re-operation, revision, or supplemental fixation within the 24 month postoperative period compared with 1.8% of ProDisc-C patients (p=.033). At 24 months, there was a statistically significant difference in medication usage with 89.9% of ProDisc-C patients not on strong narcotics or muscle relaxants, compared with 81.5% of Fusion patients. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The results of this clinical trial demonstrate that ProDisc-C is a safe and effective surgical treatment for patients with disabling cervical radiculopathy because of single-level disease. By all primary and secondary measures evaluated, clinical outcomes after ProDisc-C implantation were either equivalent or superior to those same clinical outcomes after Fusion.",1

Data were collected preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (ODQ), and patient satisfaction rates were evaluated at these intervals, as well as range of motion, return to work, and recreational and ambulatory status. There were 28 ProDisc patients and 11 who underwent fusion. Six patients had two-level surgery. Estimated blood loss (ProDisc = 69 mL versus fusion = 175 mL) and operative time (ProDisc = 75 minutes versus fusion = 219 minutes) were significantly different (P < 0.01). Hospital stays were shorter (ProDisc = 2.1 days versus fusion = 3.5 days [P < 0.01]) for ProDisc patients. There was a significantly greater reduction in the ODQ scores at 3 months in the ProDisc group compared with the fusion group (P < 0.05). No difference was noted in VAS. A trend was identified at 6 months in patient satisfaction rates favoring ProDisc versus fusion (P = 0.08), and motion was significantly improved in ProDisc patients compared with the fusion group (P = 0.02). Ambulatory status as well as recreational activity improved faster in the ProDisc group.

Serving as the control, ACDF was performed at 1 level in 81 patients and 2 levels in 105 patients. Study selection criteria, fusion technique, and outcome measures were identical, with the only exception being the number of levels that were pathological and operated.Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores, visual analog scales assessing neck and arm pain, and SF-12 scores improved significantly in both groups. Significant differences were observed between groups on NDI and SF-12 PCS scores through 60 months. Fusion rates were 93.3% in the 1-level group and 86.1% in the 2-level (60 months, not significantly different).

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to investigate efficacy and safety of i-Factor Bone Graft (i-Factor) compared with local autograft in single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for cervical radiculopathy. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA i-Factor is a composite bone substitute material consisting of the P-15 synthetic collagen fragment adsorbed onto anorganic bone mineral and suspended in an inert biocompatible hydrogel carrier. P-15 has demonstrated bone healing efficacy in dental, orthopedic, and nonhuman applications. METHODS Patients randomly received either autograft (N = 154) or i-Factor (N = 165) in a cortical ring allograft. Study success was defined as noninferiority in fusion, Neck Disability Index (NDI), and Neurological Success endpoints, and similar adverse events profile at 12 months. RESULTS At 12 months (follow-up rate 87%), both i-Factor and autograft subjects demonstrated a high fusion rate (88.97% and 85.82%, respectively, noninferiority P = 0.0004), significant improvements in NDI (28.75 and 27.40, respectively, noninferiority P < 0.0001), and high Neurological Success rate (93.71% and 93.01%, respectively, noninferiority P < 0.0001). There was no difference in the rate of adverse events (83.64% and 82.47% in the i-Factor and autograft groups, respectively, P = 0.8814). Overall success rate consisting of fusion, NDI, Neurological Success and Safety Success was higher in i-Factor subjects than in autograft subjects (68.75% and 56.94%, respectively, P = 0.0382). Improvements in VAS pain and SF-36v2 scores were clinically relevant and similar between the groups. A high proportion of patients reported good or excellent Odom outcomes (81.4% in both groups). CONCLUSION i-Factor has met all four FDA mandated noninferiority success criteria and has demonstrated safety and efficacy in single-level ACDF for cervical radiculopathy. i-Factor and autograft groups demonstrated significant postsurgical improvement and high fusion rates.

There is a paucity of data available regarding the comparative performance of lumbar TDR.Patients presenting with symptomatic single-level lumbar DDD who failed at least 6 months of nonsurgical management were randomly allocated (2:1) to treatment with an investigational TDR device (activL, n = 218) or FDA-approved control TDR devices (ProDisc-L or Charité, n = 106). The hypothesis of this study was that a composite effectiveness outcome at 2 years in patients treated with activL would be noninferior (15% delta) to that in controls.The primary composite endpoint of this study was met, which demonstrated that the activL TDR was noninferior to control TDR (P < 0.001). A protocol-defined analysis of the primary composite endpoint also confirmed that activL was superior to controls (P = 0.02). Radiographic success was higher with activL versus controls (59% vs. 43%; P < 0.01). Mean back pain severity improved by 74% with activL and 68% with controls. Oswestry Disability Index scores decreased by 67% and 61% with activL and controls, respectively. Patient satisfaction with treatment was over 90% in both groups at 2 years. Return to work was approximately 1 month shorter (P = 0.08) with activL versus controls. The rate of device-related serious adverse events was lower in patients treated with activL versus controls (12% vs. 19%; P = 0.13). Surgical reintervention rates at the index level were comparable (activL 2.3%, control 1.9%).The single-level activL TDR is safe and effective for the treatment of symptomatic lumbar DDD through 2 years.2.",1

A new bioactive composite material designed specifically for vertebroplasty showed promising results in animals and nonrandomized clinical studies and was subsequently compared with PMMA in a randomized study. This study represents the first prospective study evaluating vertebroplasty comparing PMMA with another material with 24-month follow-up.Using 2:1 randomization, vertebroplasty was performed with Cortoss on 162 patients and PMMA on 94 patients. Inclusion criteria were painful osteoporotic VCFs with a visual analogue scale pain score of at least 50 mm on a 100-mm scale and at least 30% disability as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index. Evaluations at pretreatment, treatment day, and 7 posttreatment intervals out to 24 months included pain, disability, neurological status, adverse events, quality of life, patient satisfaction, analgesic use, and independently reviewed radiographs.Noninferiority of Cortoss relative to PMMA was observed, with Cortoss-treated patients experiencing significant pain relief at 3 months (P = 0.0395) and better maintenance or improvement in function at 24 months (P = 0.0299). Incidence of serious device-related adverse events was 4.3% in both groups; none were life threatening.Vertebroplasty using either Cortoss or PMMA provides effective, immediate, and lasting pain relief and prevents further loss of function. Both materials performed comparably at most time points; Cortoss demonstrated better results for pain reduction at 3 months and for function at 24 months.",1

Clinical and biomechanical studies evaluating these two distinct constructs are numerous; however, no prospective, randomized study comparing them has been done.A multicenter trial of 140 patients: 78 were randomized to the cylindrical threaded titanium cage device treatment arm and 62 patients randomized into the control group. All had autogenous iliac crest bone graft packed into the device. All patients had a single-level stand-alone anterior lumbar interbody fusion at either the L4-L5 or L5-S1 interspace for symptomatic degenerative disc disease. Radiographic fusion data were collected as well as multiple types of outcome data, including pain/disability scores, neurologic status, and overall health.At 12 months, 97% of the cylindrical threaded titanium cage device group and 40% of the control group demonstrated radiographic fusion. At 24 months, 97% of the cylindrical threaded titanium cage group and 52% of the control group showed radiographic fusion. These fusion rate differences are statistically significant (P < 0.001). The Oswestry and neurologic scores were not significantly different between groups.This is the first prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial that compares fusion cage results to control data.Cylindrical threaded titanium cages have a higher fusion rate, comparable improvements in clinical outcome (Oswestry, Low Back Pain Questionnaire, SF-36), and fewer secondary supplemental fixation procedures compared to the femoral ring allograft control.",1

Prior 2-year data from the treatment arm of a sham-controlled randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed maintenance of clinical improvements at 2 years following radiofrequency (RF) ablation of the basivertebral nerve (BVN).The purpose of this RCT was to compare the effectiveness of intraosseous RF ablation of the BVN to standard care for the treatment of chronic LBP in a specific subgroup of patients suspected to have vertebrogenic related symptomatology.A prospective, parallel, open label RCT was conducted at 20 U.S. sites.A total of 140 patients with chronic LBP of at least 6 months duration, with Modic Type 1 or 2 vertebral endplate changes between L3 and S1, were randomized 1:1 to undergo either RF ablation of the BVN or continue standard care.Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12-months postprocedure. Secondary outcome measures included a 10-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for LBP, ODI and VAS responder rates, SF-36, and EQ-5D-5L. The primary endpoint was a between-arm comparison of the mean change in ODI from baseline to 3 months post-treatment.Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive RF ablation or to continue standard care. Self-reported patient outcomes were collected using validated questionnaires at each study visit. An interim analysis to assess for superiority was prespecified and overseen by an independent data management committee when a minimum of 60% of patients had completed their 3-month primary endpoint visit.The interim analysis showed clear statistical superiority (p<.001) for all primary and secondary patient-reported outcome measures in the RF ablation arm compared with the standard care arm. This resulted in a data management committee recommendation to halt enrollment in the study and offer early cross-over to the control arm. These results are comprised of the outcomes of the 104 patients included in the intent-to-treat analysis of the 3-month primary endpoint, which included 51 patients in the RF ablation arm and 53 patients in the standard care arm. Baseline ODI was 46.1, VAS was 6.67, and mean age was 50 years. The percentage of patients with LBP symptoms ≥5 years was 67.3%. Comparing the RF ablation arm to the standard care arm, the mean changes in ODI at 3 months were -25.3 points versus -4.4 points, respectively, resulting in an adjusted difference of 20.9 points (p<.001). Mean changes in VAS were -3.46 versus -1.02, respectively, an adjusted difference of 2.44 cm (p<.001). In the RF ablation arm, 74.5% of patients achieved a ≥10-point improvement in ODI, compared with 32.7% in the standard care arm (p<0.001).Minimally invasive RF ablation of the BVN led to significant improvement of pain and function at 3-months in patients with chronic vertebrogenic related LBP.",1

In addition, to evaluate the radiographic outcomes of lumbar artificial disc replacement at either L4-L5 or L5-S1 with the CHARITE artificial disc as compared to anterior lumbar interbody fusion with cylindrical cages and iliac crest bone graft; and to determine if a correlation exists between clinical outcomes and surgical accuracy of TDR placement within the disc space.Prior investigators have reported excellent radiographic results with the CHARITE artificial disc for the treatment of lumbar degenerative disc disease. These encouraging results are the product of retrospective reviews without a control. Very few studies have reported on the segmental motion of an intervertebral level implanted with an artificial disc, and no studies have reported a correlation of radiographic and clinical outcomes.A prospective, randomized, multicenter, US Food and Drug Administration, investigational device exemption study with 24-month follow-up was performed at 14 centers throughout the United States. A total of 304 subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio, with 205 in the investigational group (TDR with the CHARITE artificial disc) and 99 in the control group (anterior lumbar interbody fusion with BAK cages and iliac crest bone graft). A total of 71 TDR training cases were performed (up to 5 at each site) before randomization beginning at each site. Plain radiographs were analyzed for each subject in both groups regarding range of motion (ROM) in flexion/extension, restoration of disc space height, and subsidence. Prosthesis placement in the coronal and midsagittal planes was analyzed for the 276 patients with TDR. Correlations were performed between prosthesis placement and clinical outcomes.Patients in the investigational group had a 13.6% mean increase, and those in the control group an 82.5% decrease in mean flexion/extension ROM at 24 months postoperatively compared to baseline. Patients in the investigational group had significantly better restoration of disc height than the control group (P < 0.05). There was significantly less subsidence in the investigational group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The surgical technical accuracy of CHARITE artificial disc placement was divided into 3 groups: I, ideal (83%); II, suboptimal (11%); and III, poor (6%), and correlated with clinical outcomes. The flexion/extension ROM and prosthesis function improved with the surgical technical accuracy of radiographic placement (P = 0.003).Preoperative ROM in flexion/extension was restored and maintained in patients receiving a TDR. TDR with the CHARITE artificial disc resulted in significantly better restoration of disc space height, and significantly less subsidence than anterior interbody fusion with BAK cages. Clinical outcomes and flexion/extension ROM correlated with surgical technical accuracy of CHARITE artificial disc placement. In the majority of cases, placement of the CHARITE artificial disc was ideal.",1

No long-term, randomized, prospective study on the CHARITE disc or any other artificial disc has been published to date.The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and effectiveness at the five-year follow-up time point of lumbar total disc replacement using the CHARITE artificial disc (DePuy Spine, Raynham, MA) with that of anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) with BAK cages and iliac crest autograft, for the treatment of single-level degenerative disc disease from L4 to S1, unresponsive to nonoperative treatment.Randomized controlled trial-five-year follow-up.Ninety CHARITE patients and 43 BAK patients.Self-reported measures: visual analog scale (VAS); validated Oswestry disability index (ODI version 1.0); Short-Form 36 Questionnaire, and patient satisfaction. Physiologic measures: radiographic range of motion, disc height, and segmental translation. Functional measures: work status.Of the 375 subjects enrolled in the CHARITE IDE trial, 277 were eligible for the five-year study and 160 patients thereof completed the five-year follow-up. The completers included 133 randomized patients. Overall success was defined as improvement> or =15 pts in ODI vs. baseline, no device failure, absence of major complications, and maintenance or improvement of neurological status. Additional clinical outcomes included an ODI questionnaire as well as VAS, SF-36, and patient satisfaction surveys. Work status was tracked for all patients. Safety assessments included occurrence and severity of adverse events and device failures. Radiographic analyses such as index- and adjacent-level range of motion, segmental translation, disc height, and longitudinal ossification were also carried out.Overall success was 57.8% in the CHARITE group vs. 51.2% in the BAK group (Blackwelder's test: p=0.0359, Delta=0.10). In addition, mean changes from baseline for ODI (CHARITE: -24.0 pts vs. BAK: -27.5 pts), VAS pain scores (CHARITE: -38.7 vs. BAK: -40.0), and SF-36 questionnaires (SF-36 Physical Component Scores [PCS]: CHARITE: 12.6 pts vs. BAK: 12.3 pts) were similar across groups. In patient satisfaction surveys, 78% of CHARITE patients were satisfied vs. 72% of BAK patients. A total of 65.6% patients in the CHARITE group vs. 46.5% patients in the BAK group were employed full-time. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.0403). Long-term disability was recorded for 8.0% of CHARITE patients and 20.9% of BAK patients, a difference that was also statistically significant (p=0.0441). Additional index-level surgery was performed in 7.7% of CHARITE patients and 16.3% of BAK patients. Radiographic findings included operative and adjacent-level range of motion (ROM), intervertebral disc height and segmental translation. At the five-year follow-up, the mean ROM at the index level was 6.0 degrees for CHARITE patients and 1.0 degrees for BAK patients. Changes in disc height were also similar for both CHARITE and BAK patients (0.7 mm for both groups, p=0.9827). Segmental translation was 0.4 and 0.8mm in patients implanted with CHARITE at L4-L5 vs. L5-S1, respectively, and 0.1mm in BAK patients.The results of this five-year, prospective, randomized multicenter study are consistent with the two-year reports of noninferiority of CHARITE artificial disc vs. ALIF with BAK and iliac crest autograft. No statistical differences were found in clinical outcomes between groups. In addition, CHARITE patients reached a statistically greater rate of part- and full-time employment and a statistically lower rate of long-term disability, compared with BAK patients. Radiographically, the ROMs at index- and adjacent levels were not statistically different from those observed at two-years postsurgery.",1

This cohort includes 71 nonrandomized cases, 205 randomized cases, and 313 continued access cases, all receiving the CHARITE Artificial Disc, as well as 99 randomized cases in the control group (ALIF with threaded fusion cages and autograft). A detailed analysis was performed of clinical chart notes, operative notes, and adverse event reports for all patients requiring reoperation following their index surgery.Of the 589 patients with TDR, 52 (8.8%) required reoperation. Of the 99 patients with lumbar fusion, 10 (10.1%) required reoperation, and an additional 2 required surgery for adjacent level disease (P = 0.7401). There were 24 TDR patients who underwent a repeated anterior retroperitoneal approach, with 22 (91.7%) having had a successful removal of the prosthesis. Seven of the 24 TDR prostheses requiring removal were revised to another CHARITE Artificial Disc. The mean time to reoperation in all patients was 9.7 months. A total of 29 patients (4.9%) in the TDR group required posterior instrumentation and fusion as did 10 (10.1%) in the control group (P = 0.0562). At 2 years or more follow-up, 93.9%(553/589 = 93.9%) of patients receiving TDR with the CHARITE Artificial Disc had a successfully functioning prosthesis with a mean of over 7 degrees of flexion-extension mobility.Lumbar TDR with the CHARITE Artificial Disc did not preclude any further procedures at the index level during primary insertion, with nearly one third being revisable to a new motion-preserving prosthesis and just over two thirds being successfully converted to ALIF and/ or posterior pedicle screw arthrodesis, the original alternative procedure.",1

Patients provided preoperative and postoperative clinical assessment data out to 24 months using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short Form-12 (SF-12) Health Survey, and Visual Analog Pain Scale for back and leg pain. Patients with symptomatic recurrent disc herniation were recorded.In total, 48 males and 32 females with an average age of 47.2 years were included. Mean ODI scores for subjects treated with cAM graft demonstrated statistically greater improvement at 6 weeks (14.49 vs. 21.82; P=0.05) and 24 months (6.62 vs. 14.40; P=0.02) compared with controls. Similarly, SF-12 Physical Component Scores demonstrated statistically greater gains in the cAM group at both the 6 weeks and 24 months. None of the subjects in the cAM graft group sustained a recurrent herniation at the same surgical level, whereas 3 patients in the control group sustained a recurrent herniation at the same surgical level, with 2 requiring fusion to manage persistent pain.The data demonstrate statistically superior clinical outcomes following lumbar microdiscectomy as measured by ODI and SF-12 (physical composite scale) and a lower rate of recurrent herniation with the use of a cAM tissue graft compared with traditional microdiscectomy.",1

Study success required superiority of annular closure on both end points at 2-year follow-up.Patients received lumbar microdiscectomy with additional bone-anchored annular closure device (n=276 participants) or lumbar microdiscectomy only (control; n=278 participants). This research was supported by Intrinsic Therapeutics. Two authors received study-specific support morethan $10,000 per year, 8 authors received study-specific support less than $10,000 per year, and 11 authors received no study-specific support.Among 554 randomized participants, 550 (annular closure device: n=272; control: n=278) were included in the modified intent-to-treat efficacy analysis and 550 (annular closure device: n=267; control: n=283) were included in the as-treated safety analysis. Both co-primary end points of the study were met, with recurrent herniation (50% vs. 70%, P<.001) and composite end point success (27% vs. 18%, P=.02) favoring annular closure device. The frequency of symptomatic reherniation was lower with annular closure device (12% vs. 25%, P<.001). There were 29 reoperations in 24 patients in the annular closure device group and 61 reoperations in 45 control patients. The frequency of reoperations to address recurrent herniation was 5% with annular closure device and 13% in controls (P=.001). End plate changes were more prevalent in the annular closure device group (84% vs. 30%, P<.001). Scores for back pain, leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index, and health-related quality of life at regular visits were comparable between groups over 2-year follow-up.In patients at high risk of herniation recurrence after lumbar microdiscectomy, annular closure with a bone-anchored implant lowers the risk of symptomatic recurrence and reoperation. Additional study to determine outcomes beyond 2 years with a bone-anchored annular closure device is warranted.",1

Optimal treatment of VCFs should address pain, function, and deformity. Kiva is a novel implant for vertebral augmentation in the treatment of VCFs.A total of 300 subjects with 1 or 2 painful osteoporotic VCFs were randomized to blindly receive Kiva (n = 153) or BK (n = 147). Subjects were followed through 12 months. The primary endpoint was a composite at 12 months defined as a reduction in fracture pain by at least 15 mm on the visual analogue scale, maintenance or improvement in function on the Oswestry Disability Index, and absence of device-related serious adverse events. Secondary endpoints included cement usage, extravasation, and adjacent level fracture.A mean improvement of 70.8 and 71.8 points in the visual analogue scale score and 38.1 and 42.2 points in the Oswestry Disability Index was noted in Kiva and BK, respectively. No device-related serious adverse events occurred. Despite significant differences in risk factors favoring the control group at baseline, the primary endpoint demonstrated noninferiority of Kiva to BK. Analysis of secondary endpoints revealed superiority with respect to cement use and site-reported extravasation and a positive trend in adjacent level fracture warranting further study.The KAST study successfully established that the Kiva system is noninferior to BK based on a composite primary endpoint assessment incorporating pain-, function-, and device-related serious adverse events for the treatment of VCFs due to osteoporosis. Kiva was shown to be noninferior to BK and revealed a positive trend in several secondary endpoints.1.",1

Artificial disc replacement in the spine is designed to preserve motion at the intervertebral segment and subsequently reduce adjacent segment degeneration. This is the first study to compare a metal-on-metal artificial lumbar disc replacement with circumferential fusion. Here we report the 2-year follow-up results.Forty-four patients were treated with the FlexiCore and 23 patients were treated with fusion. The FlexiCore treatment group consisted of 23 men and 21 women, with an average age of 36 and an average body mass index of 28. Thirty-two of the FlexiCore surgeries were performed at L5-S1, and 12 were performed at L4-L5. The control treatment group consisted of 10 men and 13 women, with an average age of 41 and an average body mass index of 28. Seventeen of the control surgeries were performed at L5-S1, 5 were performed at L4-L5, and 1 was a 2-level fusion performed at L4-L5 and L5-S1. Prospective data were collected before surgery and after surgery at 6 weeks, and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Disability and pain were assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index and the Visual Analog Scale. Range of motion was determined by independent radiologic assessment of flexion/extension and lateral bending radiographs.The mean Oswestry Disability Index scores were 62 (FlexiCore) and 58 (control) before surgery, 36 (FlexiCore) and 50 (control) at 6 weeks, and 6 (FlexiCore) and 12 (control) at 2 years. The mean Visual Analog Scale scores were 86 (FlexiCore) and 82 (control) before surgery, 32 (FlexiCore) and 43 (control) at 6 weeks, and 16 (FlexiCore) and 20 (control) at 2 years. The FlexiCore group's angular rotation averaged 2.8 degrees before surgery and 3.8 degrees at 6 weeks after surgery. The group's lateral bending averaged 4.7 degrees before surgery and 4.2 degrees at 6 weeks after surgery. The average operative time (skin to skin) was 82 minutes for the FlexiCore group versus 179 minutes for the control group (P < 0.001). The average estimated blood loss was 97 mL for the FlexiCore group versus 179 mL for the control group (P < 0.02). The average hospital stay was 2 days for the FlexiCore group versus 3 days for the control group (P < 0.005).These initial results from 2 study sites demonstrate that the FlexiCore compares very favorably to circumferential fusion for the treatment of lumbar DDD unresponsive to conservative treatment.

Minimally invasive procedures, including percutaneous therapies under local anesthesia, are increasingly gaining attention. One of these treatments is Percutaneous Laser Disc Decompression (PLDD). This treatment can be carried out in an outpatient setting and swift recovery and return to daily routine are suggested. Thus far, no randomized trial into cost-effectiveness of PLDD versus standard surgical procedure has been performed. We present the design of a randomized controlled trial, studying the cost-effectiveness of PLDD versus conventional open discectomy in patients with sciatica from lumbar disc herniation.The study is a randomized prospective multi-center trial, in which two treatment strategies are compared in a parallel group design. Patients (age 18-70 years) visiting the neurosurgery department of the participating hospitals, are considered for inclusion in the trial when sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation has lasted more than 8 weeks. Patients with disc herniation smaller than 1/3 of the spinal canal diameter, without concomitant lateral recess stenosis or sequestration, are eligible for participation, and are randomized into one of two treatment arms; either Percutaneous Laser Disc Decompression or conventional discectomy. The functional outcome of the patient, as assessed by the Roland Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica at 8 weeks and 1 year after treatment, is the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome parameters are recovery as perceived by the patient, leg and back pain, incidence of re-intervention, complications, quality of life, medical consumption, absence of work and secondary costs.Open discectomy is still considered to be the golden standard in the surgical treatment of lumbar disc herniation.

Blinding was impossible because of the nature of the interventions. This study was funded by the Healthcare Insurance Board of the Netherlands.The primary outcome, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, showed noninferiority of PLDD at 8 (-0.1; [95% confidence interval (CI), -2.3 to 2.1]) and 52 weeks (-1.1; 95% CI, -3.4 to 1.1) compared with conventional surgery. There was, however, a higher speed of recovery in favor of conventional surgery (hazard ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.42-0.97]). The number of reoperations was significantly less in the conventional surgery group (38% vs. 16%).

Objective To assess effectiveness of microdiscectomy in lumbar disc herniation patients with 6 to 12 weeks of symptoms but no absolute indication for surgery. Summary of background data There is limited evidence in favor of discectomy for prolonged symptoms of lumbar disc herniation. However, only one randomized trial has directly compared discectomy with conservative treatment. Methods Fifty-six patients (age range, 20-50 years) with a lumbar disc herniation, clinical findings of nerve root compression, and radicular pain lasting 6 to 12 weeks were randomized to microdiscectomy or conservative management. Fifty patients (89%) were available at the 2-year follow-up. Leg pain intensity was the primary outcome measure. Results There were no clinically significant differences between the groups in leg or back pain intensity, subjective disability, or health-related quality of life over the 2-year follow-up, although discectomy seemed to be associated with a more rapid initial recovery. In a subgroup analysis, discectomy was superior to conservative treatment when the herniation was at L4-L5. Conclusions Lumbar microdiscectomy offered only modest short-term benefits in patients with sciatica due to disc extrusion or sequester. Spinal level of the herniation may be an important factor modifying effectiveness of surgery, but this hypothesis needs verification.",1

METHODS Under approved institutional ethics review, 230 patients (1:1 ratio) randomized to either DA or D+ILS (coflex, Paradigm Spine) were treated at 7 sites in Germany. Patients had moderate to severe LSS at 1 or 2 adjacent segments from L-3 to L-5. Outcomes were evaluated up to 2 years postoperatively, including Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, the presence of secondary surgery or lumbar injections, neurological status, and the presence of device- or procedure-related severe adverse events. The composite clinical success (CCS) was defined as combining all 4 of these outcomes, a success definition validated in a US FDA pivotal trial. Additional secondary end points included visual analog scale (VAS) scores, Zürich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) scores, narcotic usage, walking tolerance, and radiographs. RESULTS The overall follow-up rate was 91% at 2 years. There were no significant differences in patient-reported outcomes at 24 months (p &gt; 0.05). The CCS was superior for the D+ILS arm (p = 0.017). The risk of secondary intervention was 1.75 times higher among patients in the DA group than among those in the D+ILS group (p = 0.055). The DA arm had 228% more lumbar injections (4.5% for D+ILS vs 14.8% for DA; p = 0.0065) than the D+ILS one. Patients who underwent DA had a numerically higher rate of narcotic use at every time point postsurgically (16.7% for D+ILS vs 23% for DA at 24 months). Walking Distance Test results were statistically significantly different from baseline; the D+ILS group had &gt; 2 times the improvement of the DA. The patients who underwent D+ILS had &gt; 5 times the improvement from baseline compared with only 2 times the improvement from baseline for the DA group. Foraminal height and disc height were largely maintained in patients who underwent D+ILS, whereas patients treated with DA showed a significant decrease at 24 months postoperatively (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study showed no significant difference in the individual patient-reported outcomes (e.g., ODI, VAS, ZCQ) between the treatments when viewed in isolation. The CCS (survivorship, ODI success, absence of neurological deterioration or device- or procedure-related severe adverse events) is statistically superior for ILS. Microsurgical D+ILS increases walking distance, decreases compensatory pain management, and maintains radiographic foraminal height, extending the durability and sustainability of a decompression procedure.

The primary composite endpoint was the proportion of patients who were free of any intraoperative CSF leakage during Valsalva maneuver after dural repair, CSF leak/pseudomeningocele, and unplanned retreatment of the surgical site. Each component was then analyzed individually as a secondary endpoint. Patients were followed for 4 mo after surgery.The primary composite endpoint at the 120-d follow-up was achieved in 91.2% of the test sealant group compared with 90.6% of the control, thus showing that the test sealant was statistically significantly noninferior to DuraSeal ( P = .0049). Post hoc analysis of the primary composite endpoint at 14 d demonstrated superiority of the test sealant over the control ( P = .030). Primary endpoint failures in the control group tended to occur early in follow-up period, while a majority of test dural sealant failures were identified through protocol-required radiographic imaging at the 120-d follow-up visit.The test sealant, Adherus Dural Sealant, is a practical, safe, and effective adjunct to achieving a watertight dural closure after primary dural closure in cranial procedures.",1

Surgical technique, number of treated levels, and type of implant has been shown to be of possible importance.One hundred thirty-six patients from a randomized controlled trial between artificial disc replacement and ACDF in 1 or 2 surgical levels were evaluated regarding dysphagia. Evaluation was done with the dysphagia short questionnaire preoperatively, at 4 weeks, 3 months, and 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Reconstruction in the artificial disc replacement group was performed with the Discover artificial disc. Bone graft and anterior plating was used in the ACDF group. Type of implant was blinded to the patients and the surgeon until time of implantation.Demographics and dysphagia short questionnaire levels were similar in both groups preoperative. At 4 weeks of follow-up postoperatively, dysphagia was significantly higher in both groups than baseline levels, P < 0.01. No significant differences were seen between the groups until follow-up at 2 years, which showed significantly higher dysphagia short questionnaire levels in the ACDF group, P = 0.04. The difference was statistically significant in both patients treated with 1- and 2-level surgery, P = 0.029 and P = 0.032, respectively. A logistic regression model showed a stronger association to type of implant than to number of surgical levels. Duration of surgery was highly associated to number of surgical levels but did not differ significantly between types of implant.Long-term postoperative dysphagia could be explained by bulk of implant or decreased motion in the cervical spine. However, it is doubtful if differences between the groups in this study can be interpreted as a clinically important difference.2.",1

Although most postoperative dysphagia is mild and transient, severe dysphagia can have profound effects on overall patient health and on surgical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of local to intravenous (IV) steroid administration during ACDF on postoperative dysphagia and dysphonia.This was a single-blinded, prospective, randomized clinical trial. Seventy-five patients undergoing ACDF with cervical plating were randomized into 3 groups: control (no steroid), IV steroid (10 mg of IV dexamethasone at the time of closure), or local steroid (40 mg of local triamcinolone). Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were collected for dysphagia, dysphonia, and neck pain postoperatively for 1 year.Patient demographics were similar. Postoperative day 1 PROMs showed significantly lower scores for dysphonia (p = 0.015) and neck pain (p = 0.034) in the local steroid group. At 2 weeks postoperatively, the local steroid cohort showed significantly decreased prevalence of severe dysphagia (Eating Assessment Tool-10 [EAT-10], severe dysphagia, p = 0.027) compared with the control and IV steroid groups. Both steroid groups had significantly less severe dysphagia when compared with the control group at the 6-week and 3-month time points. At 1 year postoperatively, both steroid groups had significantly reduced dysphagia rates (p = 0.014) compared with the control group.Both local and IV steroid administration after cervical plating in ACDF yielded better PROMs for dysphagia compared with a control group. This finding is particularly evident in the reduced number of patients who reported severe dysphagia symptoms following ACDF with local steroid application within the first 2 postoperative weeks. Future studies should attempt to stratify dysphagia severity when reporting outcomes related to anterior cervical spine surgery.Therapeutic Level I.

In total, 153 patients were included.Self-assessment with Neck Disability Index (NDI) as a primary outcome variable and EQ-5D and visual analog scale as secondary outcome variables.Patients were randomly allocated to either treatment with the Depuy Discover artificial disc or fusion with iliac crest bone graft and plating. Randomization was blinded to both patient and caregivers until time for implantation. Adverse events, complications, and revision surgery were registered as well as loss of follow-up.Data were available in 137 (91%) of the included and initially treated patients. Both groups improved significantly after surgery. NDI changed from 63.1 to 39.8 in an intention-to-treat analysis. No statistically significant difference between the ADR and the ACDF groups could be demonstrated with NDI values of 39.1 and 40.1, respectively. Nor in secondary outcome measures (EQ-5D and visual analog scale) could any statistically significant differences be demonstrated between the groups. Nine patients in the ADR group and three in the fusion group underwent secondary surgery because of various reasons. Two patients in each group underwent secondary surgery because of adjacent segment pathology. Complication rates were not statistically significant between groups.Artificial disc replacement did not result in better outcome compared to fusion measured with NDI 2 years after surgery.",1

In the present study, they evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the artificial disc based on data obtained at a single investigational site.Patients with primary, single-level cervical disc disease producing radiculopathy and/or myelopathy were randomized prospectively to undergo anterior cervical discectomy with either fusion or artificial disc placement. The patients were evaluated with pre- and postoperative serial radiographic studies; the authors also evaluated neck disability indices, visual analog scale scores for pain, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey scores, and neurological status at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Analysis of the early results obtained in the 33 patients indicated an absence of device-related complications. Preliminary analysis revealed that improvement in all clinical outcome measures was excellent for both treatment groups; however, in patients treated with the artificial cervical disc, motion at the treated level was maintained.The preliminary results documented at this investigational site are encouraging. Evaluation of data acquired in the Bryan disc treatment group showed that improvements in the clinical parameters were similar to those in the fusion group. Additionally in the artificial disc-treated group, there was radiographic evidence that motion was maintained. It is theorized that motion preservation may potentially reduce the rate of adjacent-level cervical disc disease that has been documented in patients who undergo ACDF.",1

METHODS In this single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial, patients were included if they had persistent signs and symptoms of radiculopathy with corresponding imaging-confirmed lumbar disc herniation. Patients were randomly allocated to the PTED or the MED group by computer-generated randomization codes. The primary outcome was the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score 1 year after surgery. Secondary outcomes included scores of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey bodily pain and physical function scales, EuroQol Group’s EQ-5D , and the visual analog scales for back pain and leg pain. Data including duration of operation, in-bed time, length of hospital stay, surgical cost and total hospital cost, complications, and reoperations were recorded. RESULTS A total of 153 participants were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups (PTED vs MED), and 89.5% (137 patients) completed 1 year of follow-up. Primary and secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between the treatment groups at each prespecified follow-up point (p &gt; 0.05). For PTED, there was less postoperative improvement in ODI score in the median herniation subgroup at 1 week (p = 0.027), 3 months (p = 0.013), 6 months (p = 0.027), and 1 year (p = 0.028) compared with the paramedian subgroup. For MED, there was significantly less improvement in ODI score at 3 months (p = 0.008), 6 months (p = 0.028), and 1 year (p = 0.028) in the far-lateral herniation subgroup compared with the paramedian subgroup. The total complication rate over the course of 1 year was 13.75% in the PTED group and 16.44% in the MED group (p = 0.642). Five patients (6.25%) in the PTED group and 3 patients (4.11%) in the MED group suffered from residue/recurrence of herniation, for which reoperation was required. CONCLUSIONS Over the 1-year follow-up period, PTED did not show superior clinical outcomes and did not seem to be a safer procedure for patients with lumbar disc herniation compared with MED. PTED had inferior results for median disc herniation, whereas MED did not seem to be the best treatment option for far-lateral disc herniation.

This prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the clinical outcomes of percutaneous PDD as compared to conservative care (CC) through 1 year. Patients (n = 115) had neck/arm pain >50 on the visual analog scale (VAS) pain scale and had failed at least 30 days of failed CC. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either PDD (n = 62) or CC (n = 58). Clinical outcome was determined by VAS pain score, neck disability index (NDI) score, and SF-36 health survey, collected at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The PDD group had significantly lower VAS pain scores at all follow-up time points (PDD vs. CC: 6 weeks, -46.87 +/- 2.71 vs. -15.26 +/- 1.97; 3 months, -53.16 +/- 2.74 vs. -30.45 +/- 2.59; 6 months, -56.22 +/- 2.63 vs. -40.26 +/- 2.56; 1 year, -65.73 +/- 2.24 vs. -36.45 +/- 2.86; GEE, P < 0.0001).

Additional investigation has suggested that a subset of patients may benefit further by avoiding repeated readmissions due to serious adverse events (SAEs) if they receive one vertebral augmentation approach over another.The primary aim was to assess the effect of 2 different augmentation procedures on readmission rates for SAEs.The KAST trial is a pivotal, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial conducted to evaluate an implant-based vertebral augmentation approach (implant) against BK. Post-hoc analysis was performed to evaluate SAEs and readmission rates.Twenty-one sites in North America and Europe.The treatment effect of vertebral implant versus BK on SAEs requiring unplanned readmission was evaluated by estimating the risk of SAEs associated with readmissions in KAST while controlling for key baseline covariates using multivariate Poisson regression modeling.Forty (27.8%) patients with implants had 69 SAEs associated with readmission compared to 44 (31.2%) patients with BK having 103 events. The risk for all SAEs leading to readmission was 34.4% lower with the implant than for BK (95% confidence interval = 11.1%, 51.7%; P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that the risk of SAEs associated with readmission was decreased in subjects treated with the implant compared to BK, and increased in patients with prior histories of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) or significant osteoporosis.The power of the KIVA study was based on clinical efficacy criteria to meet FDA requirements and recommendations for equivalency or noninferiority. The primary endpoint in this post-hoc analysis is SAEs associated with readmissions; as a result, the sample size is underpowered, although the results remain significant.The augmentation approaches compared here have similar pain relief and quality of life effects; the implant showed a lower risk of readmissions.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01123512.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the twenty-four-month results of a clinical trial of the ProDisc-L total disc replacement as compared with spinal fusion for the treatment of degenerative disc disease at two contiguous vertebral levels from L3 to S1.A total of 237 patients were treated in a randomized controlled trial designed as a non-inferiority study for regulatory application purposes. Blocked randomization was performed with use of a 2:1 ratio of total disc arthroplasty to circumferential arthrodesis. Evaluations, including patient self-assessments, physical and neurological examinations, and radiographic examinations, were performed preoperatively, six weeks postoperatively, and three, six, twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four months postoperatively.At twenty-four months, 58.8% (eighty-seven) of 148 patients in the total disc replacement group were classified as a statistical success, compared with 47.8% (thirty-two) of sixty-seven patients in the arthrodesis group; non-inferiority was demonstrated. The mean Oswestry Disability Index in both groups significantly improved from baseline (p < 0.0001); the mean percentage improvement for the total disc replacement group was significantly better than that for the arthrodesis group (p = 0.0282). An established clinical criterion for success, a ≥15-point improvement in the Oswestry Disability Index from baseline, occurred in 73.2% (109) of 149 patients in the total disc replacement group and 59.7% (thirty-seven) of sixty-two patients in the arthrodesis group. The Short Form-36 physical component scores were significantly better for the total disc replacement group as compared with the arthrodesis group (p = 0.0141 at twenty-four months). Visual analog scale scores for satisfaction significantly favored total disc replacement from three to twenty-four months. At twenty-four months, 78.2% (111) of 142 patients in the total disc replacement group and 62.1% (thirty-six) of fifty-eight patients in the arthrodesis group responded ""yes"" when asked if they would have the same surgery again. Lumbar spine range of motion on radiographs averaged 7.8° at the superior disc and 6.2° at the inferior disc in patients with total disc replacement. Reduction in narcotics usage significantly favored the total disc replacement group at twenty-four months after surgery (p = 0.0020).Despite the relatively short duration of follow-up and design limitations, the present study suggests that two-level lumbar disc arthroplasty is an alternative to and offers clinical advantages in terms of pain relief and functional recovery in comparison with arthrodesis. Longer-term follow-up is needed to determine the risks for implant wear and/or degenerative segment changes.",1

Radiographic results of a multicenter, prospective randomized study comparing 1-level cervical total disc replacement (TDR-C) with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Objective. To evaluate the effect on device-level lordosis, cranial and caudal adjacent level lordosis, and overall cervical sagittal alignment (C2–C6) after TDR-C or ACDF. Summary of Background Data. Cervical total disc replacement (TDR-C) has emerged as a promising alternative to ACDF in a select group of patients. The maintenance and/or improvement of sagittal balance is essential in preserving functionality after reconstructive spinal procedures. Recent studies have documented changes in spinal alignment after TDR-C, however, no studies have compared these changes to those noted in matched group of patients that have undergone ACDF. Methods. Radiographic data were obtained from the randomized group of a multicenter, randomized, prospective, controlled study comparing TDR-C (ProDisc-C, Synthes Spine, West Chester, PA) with ACDF in the treatment of 1-level cervical disc disease. Complete radiographic data were available for 89 TDR-C patients (average age: 42.2 years) and 91 ACDF patients (average age: 41.7 years). Cervical lordosis at the device level, cranial and caudal adjacent levels, and total cervical lordosis (C2–C6) were independently measured before surgery and 2 years after surgery using custom image stabilization software (Quantitative Motion Analysis, Medical Metrics, Inc, Houston, TX). Results. C5–C6 was the most common operative level (TDR-C: 54%; ACDF: 55%). At 2 years after surgery, the TDR-C group experienced statistically significant changes in lordosis of 3.0° (P < 0.001), 0.90° (P = 0.006), and −1.9° (P < 0.001) at the operative, cranial, and caudal adj-acent levels, respectively. ACDF experienced changes in lordosis of 4.2° (P < 0.001), 1.0° (P = 0.001), and −1.5° (P = 0.001), respectively. The between-group differences were significant at the operative level (P = 0.03) and the caudal adjacent level (P = 0.05). Total cervical lordosis increased in both TDR-C and ACDF by 3.1° and 3.8°, respectively (P = 0.49). Conclusion. In both TDR-C and ACDF, lordosis increased at the device-level, cranial adjacent level, and in total cervical lordosis, while lordosis decreased at the caudal adjacent level. Although ACDF facilitated a greater increase in device level lordosis (+1.25°) and less loss of lordosis at the caudal adjacent level compared with TDR-C (−0.39°), the clinical relevance of the small differences remain unknown. In both cervical disc arthroplasty and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, lordosis increased at the device-level, cranial adjacent level, and in total cervical lordosis, while lordosis decreased at the caudal adjacent level. Although anterior cervical discectomy and fusion facilitated a greater increase in device level lordosis (+1.25°) and less loss of lordosis at the caudal adjacent level compared with arthroplasty (−0.39°), the clinical relevance of the small differences remain unknown.",1

Minimal invasive discectomy with tubular retractors is hypothesised to cause less tissue damage and result in lower blood loss, less postoperative pain and faster recovery. We previously reported our 1 and 2-year results, and found no better outcomes of tubular discectomy compared with open microdiscectomy. Until now, no studies on tubular discectomy have reported results with more than 2 years of follow-up. Studies with long-term follow-up are required to determine if clinical outcomes are sustained and to assess specific long-term outcomes such as reoperation rate and iatrogenic low back pain due to impaired spinal integrity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the 5-year results of tubular discectomy compared with conventional microdiscectomy.The study was designed as a double-blind randomised controlled trial. 325 patients with a symptomatic lumbar disc herniation were randomly allocated to tubular discectomy (166 patients) or conventional microdiscectomy (159 patients). Repeated standardised follow-up measurements were performed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 26, 38, 52, 78, 104, 156, 208 and 260 weeks after randomisation. Main outcomes are the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica (RDQ), Visual Analogue Scale for leg pain and low back pain, self-perceived recovery and reoperation incidence.There was no clinically significant difference between tubular discectomy and conventional microdiscectomy regarding the main clinical outcomes at any time point during the 5 years of follow-up. RDQ scores at 5 years were 4.3 (95% CI 3.3 to 5.2) in the tubular discectomy group and 3.4 (95% CI 2.4 to 4.5) in the conventional microdiscectomy group. The mean difference of 0.9 (95% CI -0.6 to 2.2) was not significant. Mean differences for leg pain and back pain were 0.2 (95% CI -5.5 to 6.0) and 0.4 (95% CI -5.9 to 6.7), respectively. 77% of patients allocated to conventional discectomy reported complete or near-complete recovery of symptoms compared with 74% of patients allocated to tubular discectomy (p=0.79). The reoperation rate was 18% in the tubular discectomy group and 13% in the conventional discectomy group (p=0.29).Long-term functional and clinical outcome did not differ between patients allocated to tubular discectomy and conventional microdiscectomy. Primary and secondary outcome measures did not support the hypothesised advantages of tubular discectomy over conventional microdiscectomy.ISRCTN51857546.",1

A randomized controlled trial,"The concept of minimally invasive lumbar disc surgery comprises reduced muscle injury. The aim of this study was to evaluate creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in serum and the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the multifidus muscle on magnetic resonance imaging as indicators of muscle injury. We present the results of a double-blind randomized trial on patients with lumbar disc herniation, in which tubular discectomy and conventional microdiscectomy were compared. In 216 patients, CPK was measured before surgery and at day 1 after surgery. In 140 patients, the CSA of the multifidus muscle was measured at the affected disc level before surgery and at 1 year after surgery. The ratios (i.e. post surgery/pre surgery) of CPK and CSA were used as outcome measures. The multifidus atrophy was classified into three grades ranging from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe atrophy), and the difference between post and pre surgery was used as an outcome. Patients’ low-back pain scores on the visual analogue scale (VAS) were documented before surgery and at various moments during follow-up. Tubular discectomy compared with conventional microdiscectomy resulted in a nonsignificant difference in CPK ratio, although the CSA ratio was significantly lower in tubular discectomy. At 1 year, there was no difference in atrophy grade between both groups nor in the percentage of patients showing an increased atrophy grade (14% tubular vs. 18% conventional). The postoperative low-back pain scores on the VAS improved in both groups, although the 1-year between-group mean difference of improvement was 3.5 mm (95% CI; 1.4–5.7 mm) in favour of conventional microdiscectomy. In conclusion, tubular discectomy compared with conventional microdiscectomy did not result in reduced muscle injury. Postoperative evaluation of CPK and the multifidus muscle showed similar results in both groups, although patients who underwent tubular discectomy reported more low-back pain during the first year after surgery.",1

Several fibrosis inhibitors have been used in the past in an endeavor for better functional outcome.The goal of this study was to evaluate DuraSeal Xact Adhesion Barrier and Sealant System (DSX), a polyethylene glycol-based synthetic fibrosis inhibitor, for its ability to reduce postoperative pain after lumbar microdiscectomy.This is a prospective randomized controlled study.Twenty patients between 19 and 71 years of age about to undergo elective lumbar single-level discectomy were randomized into two groups of 10.Assessments included the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, the short form (SF)-36 questionnaire, and the Oswestry low back pain scale, preoperatively and at discharge, and 30, 90, and 180 days after surgery.One group was treated with DSX, and the control group received the local standard of care. DSX was applied as a thin layer on the nerve root and surrounding area after microdiscectomy.The VAS pain scale was lower at all time points in the DSX treatment group than in the control group. The reductions at 30, 90, and 180 days for DSX and control groups, respectively, were 43.9% versus 35.6%, 64.3% versus 44.8%, and 75.4% versus 59.6%. The SF-36 scores in the DSX treatment group showed more improvement than in the control group as soon as 30 days for physical functioning, general health, vitality, social functioning, mental health, and emotional patterns, and by 90 days for bodily pain and general health. The Oswestry pain score was lower at all time points in the DSX treatment group than in the control group. The reductions at 30, 90, and 180 days for DSX and control groups, respectively, were 41.5% versus 34.3%, 68.2% versus 42.4%, and 73.3% versus 55.4%. Wound healing was normal in the DSX treatment group, there were no complications related to DSX use, and no patient in either group required reoperation.Although this study is too small to have conclusions of efficacy and will need confirmation by larger trials, treatment of a microdiscectomy site with DSX for fibrosis prevention shows promising results in terms of safety, reduction of postoperative pain and functional results when compared to control with the additional advantage of being suitable for use in the presence of a dural tear.",1

Transmuscular tubular diskectomy has been introduced to increase the rate of recovery, although evidence is lacking of its efficacy.To determine outcomes and time to recovery in patients treated with tubular diskectomy compared with conventional microdiskectomy.The Sciatica Micro-Endoscopic Diskectomy randomized controlled trial was conducted among 328 patients aged 18 to 70 years who had persistent leg pain (>8 weeks) due to lumbar disk herniations at 7 general hospitals in The Netherlands from January 2005 to October 2006. Patients and observers were blinded during the follow-up, which ended 1 year after final enrollment.Tubular diskectomy (n = 167) vs conventional microdiskectomy (n = 161).The primary outcome was functional assessment on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) for sciatica (score range: 0-23, with higher scores indicating worse functional status) at 8 weeks and 1 year after randomization. Secondary outcomes were scores on the visual analog scale for leg pain and back pain (score range: 0-100 mm) and patient's self-report of recovery (measured on a Likert 7-point scale).Based on intention-to-treat analysis, the mean RDQ score during the first year after surgery was 6.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6 to 6.8) for tubular diskectomy and 5.4 (95% CI, 4.6 to 6.2) for conventional microdiskectomy (between-group mean difference, 0.8; 95% CI, -0.2 to 1.7). At 8 weeks after surgery, the RDQ mean (SE) score was 5.8 (0.4) for tubular diskectomy and 4.9 (0.5) for conventional microdiskectomy (between-group mean difference, 0.8; 95% CI, -0.4 to 2.1). At 1 year, the RDQ mean (SE) score was 4.7 (0.5) for tubular diskectomy and 3.4 (0.5) for conventional microdiskectomy (between-group mean difference, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.03 to 2.6) in favor of conventional microdiskectomy. On the visual analog scale, the 1-year between-group mean difference in improvement was 4.2 mm (95% CI, 0.9 to 7.5 mm) for leg pain and 3.5 mm (95% CI, 0.1 to 6.9 mm) for back pain in favor of conventional microdiskectomy. At 1 year, 107 of 156 patients (69%) assigned to tubular diskectomy reported a good recovery vs 120 of 151 patients (79%) assigned to conventional microdiskectomy (odds ratio, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.99]; P = .05).Use of tubular diskectomy compared with conventional microdiskectomy did not result in a statistically significant improvement in the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 2-year results of tubular diskectomy compared with conventional microdiskectomy. METHODS: Three hundred twenty-eight patients with persistent leg pain caused by lumbar disk herniation were randomly assigned to undergo tubular diskectomy (167 patients) or conventional microdiskectomy (161 patients). Main outcome measures were scores from Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica, Visual Analog Scale for leg pain and low-back pain, and Likert self-rating scale of global perceived recovery. RESULTS: On the basis of intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant difference between tubular diskectomy and conventional microdiskectomy in Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica scores during 2 years after surgery (between-group mean difference [Δ] = 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.3-1.6). Patients treated with tubular diskectomy reported more leg pain (Δ = 3.3 mm; 95% CI, 0.2-6.2) and more low-back pain (Δ = 3.0 mm; 95% CI, −0.2-6.3) than those patients treated with conventional microdiskectomy. At 2 years, 71% of patients assigned to tubular diskectomy documented a good recovery vs 77% of patients assigned to conventional microdiskectomy (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.45-1.28; P = .35). Repeated surgery rates within 2 years after tubular diskectomy and conventional microdiskectomy were 15% and 10%, respectively (P = .22).

Main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years at 1 year and societal costs, estimated from patient reported utilities (US and Netherlands EuroQol, Short Form Health Survey-6D, and Visual Analog Scale) and diaries on costs (health care, patient costs, and productivity).Quality-adjusted life-years during all 4 quarters and according to all utility measures were not statistically different between tubular diskectomy and conventional microdiskectomy (difference for US EuroQol, -0.012; 95% confidence interval, -0.046 to 0.021). From the healthcare perspective, tubular diskectomy resulted in nonsignificantly higher costs (difference US $460; 95% confidence interval, -243 to 1163). From the societal perspective, a nonsignificant difference of US $1491 (95% confidence interval, -1335 to 4318) in favor of conventional microdiskectomy was found. The nonsignificant differences in costs and quality-adjusted life-years in favor of conventional microdiskectomy result in a low probability that tubular diskectomy is more cost-effective than conventional microdiskectomy.Tubular diskectomy is unlikely to be cost-effective compared with conventional microdiskectomy.",1

Receiving less attention has been comparing TDR devices. Additionally, there is concern about metal-on-metal implants, with little data available for spine devices.The study included 204 patients receiving Kineflex-L (investigational) and 190 receiving CHARITÉ (control). Outcome measure included Oswestry Disability Index, visual analog pain scales (VAS), patient satisfaction, neurological status, complications, reoperations, and a composite success score. Radiographic assessment included range of motion, subsidence, and heterotrophic ossification. In 32 investigational patients, serum ion analysis was performed for cobalt and chromium. These values were compared with Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency values to merit monitoring total hip replacement patients for potential wear problems.Mean Oswestry and VAS scores in both groups improved significantly by 6 weeks and remained improved during 5-year follow-up (Oswestry Disability Index, scores in both groups were approximately 60 preoperatively vs. 20 at 2- and 5-year follow-up; P < 0.01; VAS scores improved >50% by 6 weeks and remained significantly improved; P < 0.05). Approximately 11% of both groups underwent reoperation. Radiographic analysis found segmental range of motion decreased at 3 month, then increased through 24 months, and was maintained thereafter. Serum ion level analysis found the greatest mean value at any follow-up point was less than 20% of Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommended minimum value to merit monitoring hip replacement patients.This prospective, randomized study comparing two TDRs found no significant differences in outcomes during 5-year follow-up. Both provided statistically significant improvements by 6 weeks that were maintained. This results support other studies.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Lumbar disc herniation patients with annular defect widths ≥6 mm are at high risk for recurrent herniation following limited discectomy. Recurrent herniation is associated with worse clinical outcomes and greater healthcare costs. A novel ACD may reduce the incidence of recurrent herniation and the associated burdens. METHODS A decision analytical modeling approach with a Markov method was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the ACD versus conventional discectomy. Health states were created by projecting visual analogue scale (VAS) onto Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Direct costs were calculated based on Humana and Medicare 2014 claims to represent private and public payer data, respectively. Indirect costs were calculated for lost work days using 2016 US average annual wages. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was compared to willingness-to-pay thresholds. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted. RESULTS Patients with the ACD had less symptomatic reherniations, reoperations, and complications and gained 0.0328 QALYs within the first 2 years. Total direct medical costs for the ACD group were similar to control. When productivity loss was considered, using the ACD became $2076 cheaper, per patient, than conventional discectomy. Based on direct costs alone, the ICER comparing ACD to control equaled $6030 per QALY. When indirect costs are included, the ICER became negative, which indicates that superior quality of life was attained at less cost. CONCLUSION For lumbar disc herniations patients with annular defects ≥6 mm, the ACD was, at 2 years, a highly cost-effective surgical modality compared to conventional lumbar discectomy.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether implantation of a bone-anchored annular closure device (ACD) following limited lumbar discectomy reduced the risk of recurrent herniation and complications during the first year of follow-up compared to limited lumbar discectomy alone (Controls) and whether this risk was influenced by patient characteristics.In this randomized multicenter trial, patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation and with a large annular defect following limited lumbar discectomy were randomized to bone-anchored ACD or Control groups. The risks of symptomatic reherniation, reoperation, and device- or procedure-related serious adverse events were reported over 1 year of follow-up.Among 554 patients (ACD 276; Control 278), 94% returned for 1-year follow-up. Bone-anchored ACD resulted in lower risks of symptomatic reherniation (8.4% vs. 17.3%, P = .002) and reoperation (6.7% vs. 12.9%, P = .015) versus Controls. Device- or procedure-related serious adverse events through 1 year were reported in 7.1% of ACD patients and 13.9% of Controls (P = .009). No baseline patient characteristic significantly influenced these risks.Among patients with large annular defects following limited lumbar discectomy, additional implantation with a bone-anchored ACD lowered the risk of symptomatic reherniation and reoperation over 1 year follow-up. Device- or procedure-related serious adverse events occurred less frequently in the ACD group. These conclusions were not influenced by patient characteristics. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01283438).",1

Clinical and radiological outcome was measured by NDI, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) neck pain, VAS arm pain, SF36, EQ-5D, patients' self-reported perceived recovery, radiographic cervical curvature, and adjacent segment degeneration parameters at baseline and until two years after surgery. BBraun Medical paid €298.837 to cover the costs for research nurses.The NDI declined from 41 to 47 points at baseline to 19 ± 15 in the ACD group, 19 ± 18 in the ACDF group, and 20 ± 22 in the ACDA group after surgery (p=.929). VAS arm and neck pain declined to half its baseline value and decreased below the critical value of 40 mm. Quality of life, measured by the EQ-5D, increased in all three groups. Adjacent segment degeneration parameters were comparable in all three groups as well. No statistical differences were demonstrated between the treatment groups.The hypothesis that ACDA would lead to superior clinical outcome in comparison to ACDF or ACD could not be confirmed during a 2-year follow-up time period.

Methods: Lumbar discectomy patients with an annular defect ≥6 mm width were randomized to receive additional implantation with a bone-anchored annular closure device (ACD, n=272) or no additional implantation (controls, n=278). Over 3 years follow-up, main outcomes were symptomatic reherniation, reoperation, and the percentage of patients who achieved the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) without a reoperation for leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score, and SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. Results were compared between older (≥60 years) and younger (<60 years) patients. We additionally analyzed data from two postmarket ACD registries to determine consistency of outcomes between the randomized trial and postmarket, real-world results. Results: Among all patients, older patients suffered from crippling or bed-bound preoperative disability more frequently than younger patients (57.9% vs 39.1%, p=0.03). Among controls, female sex, higher preoperative ODI, and current smoking status, but not age, were associated with greater risk of reherniation and reoperation. Compared to controls, the ACD group had lower risk of symptomatic reherniation (HR=0.45, p<0.001) and reoperation (HR=0.54, p=0.008), with risk reductions comparable in older vs younger patients. The percentage of patients achieving the MCID without a reoperation was higher in the ACD group for leg pain (81% vs 72%, p=0.04), ODI (82% vs 73%, p=0.03), PCS (85% vs 75%, p=0.01), and MCS (59% vs 46%, p=0.007), and this benefit was comparable in older versus younger patients.

Low-dose lumbar computed tomography (CT) and clinical investigations were performed preoperatively and 12 months after the operation. RESULTS: A total of 554 patients were randomized. After exclusion of dropouts, the per-protocol population included 493 patients (251 in the control group and 242 in the ACD group); the follow-up rate was ? 90%. The number of patients showing EPC at baseline was similar in both groups. The number of patients showing EPC and the total EPC lesion area significantly increased in both groups over time, but significantly increased more in the EPC group for the superior and inferior endplate (all P < 0.0001). There was no association of pre-existing number and size of EPC with sex, age, or smoking habits.

Percutaneous vertebroplasty (the injection of bone cement into the fractured vertebral body) is a relatively new procedure used to treat these fractures. There is increasing interest to examine the efficacy and safety of percutaneous vertebroplasty and to study the possibility of a placebo effect or whether the pain relief is from local anesthetics placed directly on the bone during the vertebroplasty procedure.Our goal is to test the hypothesis that patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures who undergo vertebroplasty have less disability and pain at 1 month than patients who undergo a control intervention. The control intervention is placement of local anesthesia near the fracture, without placement of cement. One hundred sixty-six patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures will be recruited over 5 years from US and foreign sites performing the vertebroplasty procedure. We will exclude patients with malignant tumor deposit (multiple myeloma), tumor mass or tumor extension into the epidural space at the level of the fracture. We will randomly assign participants to receive either vertebroplasty or the control intervention. Subjects will complete a battery of validated, standardized measures of pain, functional disability, and health related quality of life at baseline and at post-randomization time points (days 1, 2, 3, and 14, and months 1, 3, 6, and 12). Both subjects and research interviewers performing the follow-up assessments will be blinded to the randomization assignment. Subjects will have a clinic visit at months 1 and 12.

PROCON is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial comparing cervical anterior discectomy without fusion, with fusion with a stand alone cage or with implantation of a disc. The study population will be enrolled from patients with a single level cervical disc disease without myelopathic signs. Each treatment arm will need 90 patients. The patients will be followed for a minimum of five years, with visits scheduled at 6 weeks, 3 months, 12 months, and then yearly. At one year postoperatively, clinical outcome and self reported outcomes will be evaluated. At five years, the development of adjacent disc disease will be investigated.The results of this study will contribute to the discussion whether additional fusion or arthroplasty is needed and cost effective.",1

A randomized controlled trial,"To investigate the efficacy of adding supplemental fusion or arthroplasty after cervical anterior discectomy for symptomatic mono-level cervical degenerative disease (radiculopathy), which has not been substantiated in controlled trials until now.A randomized controlled trial is reported with 9 years follow up comparing anterior cervical anterior discectomy without fusion, with fusion by cage standalone, or with disc prosthesis. Patients suffering from symptomatic cervical disk degeneration at one level referred to spinal sections of department of neurosurgery or orthopedic surgery of a large general hospital with educational facilities were eligible. Neck Disability Index (NDI), McGill Pain Questionnaire Dutch language version (MPQ-DLV), physical-component summary (PCS), and mental-component summary (MCS) of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and re operation rate were evaluated.142 patients between 18 and 55 years were allocated. The median follow-up was 8.9±1.9 years (5.6 to 12.2 years). The response rate at last follow-up was 98.5%. NDI at the last follow-up did not differ between the three treatment groups, nor did the secondary outcomes as MPQ-DLV and PCS or MCS from SF-36. The major improvement occurred within the first 6 weeks after surgery. Afterward, it remained stable. Eleven patients underwent surgery for recurrent symptoms and signs due to nerve root compression at the index or adjacent level.This randomized trial could not detect a difference between three surgical modalities for treating a single-level degenerative disk disease. Anterior cervical discectomy without implant seems to be similar to anterior cervical discectomy with fusion by cage stand-alone or with disk prosthesis. Due to the small study sample size, this statement should be considered as inconclusive so far.ISRCTN41681847.",1

However, PEEK or metal cages have some undesirable imaging characteristics, leading to a search for alternative materials not creating artifacts on images; silicon nitride ceramic. Whether patients treated with silicon nitride ceramic cages have similar functional outcome as patients treated with PEEK cages is not known. We present the design of the CASCADE trial on effectiveness of ceramic cages versus PEEK cages in patients with cervical disc herniation and/or osteophytes.Patients (age 18-75 years) with monoradicular symptoms in one or both arms lasting more than 8 weeks, due to disc herniation and/or osteophytes, are eligible for the trial. The study is designed as a randomized controlled equivalence trial in which patients are blinded to the type of cage for 1 year. The total follow-up period is 2 years. The primary outcome measure is improvement in the Neck and Disability Index (NDI). Secondary outcomes measures include improvement in arm pain and neck pain (VAS), SF-36 and patients' perceived recovery. The final elements of comparison are perioperative statistics including operating time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and adverse events. Lateral plane films at each follow-up visit and CT scan (at 6 months) will be used to judge fusion and the incidence of subsidence. Based on a power of 90% and assuming 8% loss to follow-up, 100 patients will be randomized into the 2 groups. The first analysis will be conducted when all patients have 1 year of follow-up, and the groups will be followed for 1 additional year to judge stability of outcomes.While the new ceramic cage has received the CE Mark based on standard compliance and animal studies, a randomized comparative study with the golden standard product will provide more conclusive information for clinicians.

Still, complications such as subsidence and migration of the cage are frequently seen. A lack of osteointegration and fibrous tissues surrounding PEEK cages are held responsible. Ceramic implants made of silicon nitride show better biocompatible and osteoconductive qualities, and therefore are expected to lower complication rates and allow for better fusion.Purpose of this study is to show that fusion with the silicon nitride cage produces non-inferior results in outcome of the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire at all follow-up time points as compared to the same procedure with PEEK cages.Methods/DesignThis study is designed as a double blind multi-center randomized controlled trial with repeated measures analysis. 100 patients (18–75 years) presenting with symptomatic lumbar degenerative disorders unresponsive to at least 6 months of conservative treatment are included. Patients will be randomly assigned to a PEEK cage or a silicon nitride cage, and will undergo a transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with pedicle screw fixation. Primary outcome measure is the functional improvement measured by the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. Secondary outcome parameters are the VAS leg, VAS back, SF-36, Likert scale, neurological outcome and radiographic assessment of fusion. After 1 year the fusion rate will be measured by radiograms and CT. Follow-up will be continued for 2 years. Patients and clinical observers who will perform the follow-up visits will be blinded for type of cage used during follow-up. Analyses of radiograms and CT will be performed independently by two experienced radiologists.DiscussionIn this study a PEEK cage will be compared with a silicon nitride cage in the treatment of symptomatic degenerative lumbar disc disorders.

Threaded cages have now been developed for use in anterior cervical interbody fusions to obviate the need for allografts or autogenous bone grafting procedures while providing initial stability during the fusion process.Patients with symptomatic cervical discogenic radiculopathy were treated with either anterior cervical discectomy with uninstrumented bone-only fusion (ACDF) or BAK/C fusion cage(s). Independent radiographic assessment of fusion was made and patient-based outcome was assessed by visual analog pain scale and a Short Form (SF)-36 Health Status Questionnaire.Data analysis included 344 patients at 1 year and 180 at 2 years. When the two cage groups (hydroxya, patite-coated or noncoated) were compared with the ACDF group, similar outcomes were noted for duration of surgery, hospital stay, improvements in neck pain and radicular pain in the affected limb, improvements in the SF-36 Physical Component subscale and Mental Component subscale, and the patients' perception of overall surgical outcome. Symptom improvements were maintained at 2 years. A greater percentage of patients with ACDF needed an iliac crest bone harvest than did BAK/C patients (67% vs.- 3%). Successful fusion for one-level procedures at 12 months was 97.9% for the BAK/C groups and 89.7% for the ACDF group (P < 0.05). The complication rate for the ACDF group was 20.4% compared with an overall complication rate of 11.8% with BAK/C. There was no difference in complications that necessitated a second operative procedure.These results demonstrate that outcomes after a cervical fusion procedure with a threaded cage are the same as those of a conventional uninstrumented bone-only anterior discectomy and fusion with a low risk of complications and rare need for autogenous bone graft harvest.",1

The authors of studies of anterior cervical fusion for disc-related disease have documented satisfying clinical results and infrequent complications. Recently, cervical disc arthroplasty has entered clinical trials as an alternative to fusion. Although the results of anecdotal reports and prospective studies support this procedure, these studies have not conferred the validity of a controlled randomized study. In the present study, the author presents data obtained in such a study. Methods. After symptoms failed to respond to conservative therapy, 46 patients with one-level discogenic cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy were randomized to undergo arthroplasty or fusion as part of a US Food and Drug Administration medical device study. In all patients there was a minimum follow-up duration of 1 year. Equivalent results for the relief of arm pain and neck pain were noted in both treatment groups. Treatment parameters other than operative time were similar. No neurological or serious systemic complications occurred. Conclusions. Although extended follow-up data and larger patient populations are needed, the results of this study indicate that arthroplasty is a viable alternative to cervical fusion.",1

Preserving the motion of ADR devices aims to prevent immobilization side effects such as adjacent-segment pathology (ASP). However, long-term follow-up evaluations using MRI are needed to investigate if this intent is achieved. METHODS The authors performed a randomized controlled trial with 153 patients (mean age 47 years) undergoing surgery for cervical radiculopathy. Eighty-three patients received an ADR and 70 patients underwent fusion surgery. Outcomes after 5 years were assessed using patient-reported outcome measures using the Neck Disability Index (NDI) score as the primary outcome; motion preservation and heterotopic ossification by radiography; ASP by MRI; and secondary surgical procedures. RESULTS Scores on the NDI were approximately halved in both groups: the mean score after 5 years was 36 (95% confidence interval [CI] 31–41) in the ADR group and 32 (95% CI 27–38) in the fusion group (p = 0.48). There were no other significant differences between the groups in six other patient-related outcome measures. Fifty-four percent of the patients in the ADR group preserved motion at the operated cervical level and 25% of the ADRs were spontaneously fused. Seventeen ADR patients (21%) and 7 fusion patients (10%) underwent secondary surgery (p = 0.11), with 5 patients in each group due to clinical ASP. CONCLUSIONS In patients with cervical DDD and radiculopathy decompression as well as ADR, surgery did not result in better clinical or radiological outcomes after 5 years compared with decompression and fusion surgery.

The primary outcome measure was the change in the physical-component summary score of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36; range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life) 2 years after surgery. The secondary outcome measure was the score on the Oswestry Disability Index (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more disability related to back pain). Patients were followed for 4 years.A total of 66 patients (mean age, 67 years; 80% women) underwent randomization. The rate of follow-up was 89% at 1 year, 86% at 2 years, and 68% at 4 years. The fusion group had a greater increase in SF-36 physical-component summary scores at 2 years after surgery than did the decompression-alone group (15.2 vs. 9.5, for a difference of 5.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 11.3; P=0.046). The increases in the SF-36 physical-component summary scores in the fusion group remained greater than those in the decompression-alone group at 3 years and at 4 years (P=0.02 for both years). With respect to reductions in disability related to back pain, the changes in the Oswestry Disability Index scores at 2 years after surgery did not differ significantly between the study groups (-17.9 in the decompression-alone group and -26.3 in the fusion group, P=0.06). More blood loss and longer hospital stays occurred in the fusion group than in the decompression-alone group (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The cumulative rate of reoperation was 14% in the fusion group and 34% in the decompression-alone group (P=0.05).Among patients with degenerative grade I spondylolisthesis, the addition of lumbar spinal fusion to laminectomy was associated with slightly greater but clinically meaningful improvement in overall physical health-related quality of life than laminectomy alone.

Essentially, this condition is treated by performing a decompression of neural structures. Posterolateral lumbar fusion and posterior pedicle-based dynamic stabilization are additional techniques performed to ensure improved prognosis. However, to date, the selection of a surgical procedure for lumbar spinal stenosis due to degenerative spondylolisthesis remains debatable, especially in terms of the addition of instrumentation because of the few available prospective, randomized studies.We randomly assigned patients who had 1 level lumbar spinal stenosis due to degenerative spondylolisthesis at the L4/5 level to undergo either decompression alone (decompression group), decompression plus fusion (fusion group), or decompression plus stabilization (stabilization group). Outcomes were assessed using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association and Visual Analogue Scale scores.In total, 85 patients underwent randomization. The follow-up rate at 5 years was 86.4%. The fusion and stabilization groups showed higher blood loss and a longer operative time than the decompression group.

No prior randomized controlled trial with adequate study power has been performed.A total of 335 patients were randomized in 2:1 fashion to receive either OP-1 Putty or autograft in the setting of an uninstrumented posterolateral arthrodesis performed for degenerative spondylolisthesis and symptomatic spinal stenosis. Patients were observed serially with radiographs, clinical examinations, and appropriate clinical indicators, including ODI, Short-Form 36, and visual analog scale scores. Serum samples were examined at regular intervals to assess the presence of antibodies to OP-1. The primary end point, Overall Success, was analyzed at 24 months. The study was extended to include additional imaging data and long-term clinical follow-up at 36+ months. At the 36+ month time point, CT scans were obtained in addition to plain radiographs to evaluate the presence and location of new bone formation. Modified Overall Success, including improvements in ODI, absence of retreatment, neurologic success, absence of device-related serious adverse events, angulation and translation success, and new bone formation by CT scan (at 36+ months), was then calculated using the 24-month primary clinical endpoints, updated retreatment data, and CT imaging and radiographic end points.OP-1 Putty was demonstrated to be statistically equivalent to autograft with respect to the primary end point of modified overall success. The use of OP-1 Putty when compared to autograft was associated with statistically lower intraoperative blood loss and shorter operative times. Although patients in the OP-1 Putty group demonstrated an early propensity for formation of anti-OP-1 antibodies, this resolved completely in all patients with no clinical sequelae.OP-1 Putty is a safe and effective alternative to autograft in the setting of uninstrumented posterolateral spinal arthrodesis performed for degenerative spondylolisthesis and symptomatic spinal stenosis.",1

Use of rhBMP-2 on an absorbable collagen sponge in posterolateral lumbar arthrodesis requires the addition of a bulking agent to provide resistance against compression and to serve as an osteoconductive scaffold for new bone formation.We performed a prospective, randomized, multicenter pilot study to investigate the use of rhBMP-2 on an absorbable collagen sponge combined with a ceramic-granule bulking agent as a replacement for autogenous iliac crest bone graft in single-level posterolateral lumbar arthrodesis with instrumentation. The investigational group (twenty-five patients) was treated with a 1.5 mg/mL solution of rhBMP-2 on two strips of absorbable collagen sponge (total dose of rhBMP-2, 12 mg) combined with 10 cm(3) of ceramic granules. The control group (twenty-one patients) received iliac crest bone graft. Clinical outcomes were assessed with use of well-established instruments. Radiographs were reviewed to assess consolidation of fusion.Eighty-eight percent (twenty-two) of the twenty-five patients in the investigational group and 86% (eighteen) of the twenty-one patients in the control group were considered to have completed the twenty-four-month follow-up. At all follow-up intervals, there were significant improvements in the clinical outcome measures, including the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, Short Form-36 scores, and back and leg pain scores, in both groups. At twenty-four months, the improvement in the mean ODI score, as compared with the preoperative score, was 28.2 points in the investigational group and 23.0 points in the control group. By twenty-four months, 95% (eighteen) of nineteen patients in the investigational group compared with 70% (fourteen) of twenty in the control group had a radiographically documented fusion. The overall success rate was 81% (seventeen of twenty-one) in the investigational group and 55% (eleven of twenty) in the control group (p = 0.345).Compared with an iliac crest bone graft, the combination of an absorbable collagen sponge soaked with rhBMP-2 and ceramic granules resulted in trends toward improvements in clinical outcomes and toward a higher rate of radiographic fusion.

Secondary outcomes included self-reported LBP (visual analogue scale [VAS]), quality of life (EuroQol [EQ-5D]), emotional distress (Hopkins Symptom Checklist [HSCL-25]), occupational status, patient satisfaction, drug use, complications, and additional back surgery.Patients were randomly assigned to lumbar TDR or MDR. Self-reported outcome measures were collected 8 years after treatment. The study was powered to detect a difference of 10 ODI points between the groups. The study has not been funded by the industry.A total of 605 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 173 were randomly assigned treatment. Seventy-seven patients (90%) randomized to surgery and 74 patients (85%) randomized to rehabilitation responded at 8-year follow-up.

Twenty-one patients (24%) randomized to rehabilitation had crossed over and had undergone back surgery since inclusion, whereas 12 patients (14%) randomized to surgery had undergone additional back surgery. One serious adverse event after disc replacement is registered (<1%).Substantial long-term improvement can be expected after both disc replacement and MDR. The difference between groups is statistically significant in favor of surgery, but smaller than the prespecified clinically important difference of 10 ODI points that the study was designed to detect. Future research should aim to improve selection criteria for disc replacement and MDR.",1

Shi-style lumbar manipulation (SLM), as an alternative treatment for DLS, is popular in China. SLM is based on the channels and collaterals theory of the traditional Chinese medicine, in which the symptoms are believed to result from channel blockage and joint displacement. However, there is no solid evidence to show the effect of the SLM on the management of symptomatic DLS.We conduct a prospective randomized, blinded, controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of SLM with mechanical lumbar traction and explore whether it could be a potential therapy for symptomatic DLS. A total of 60 patients with symptomatic DLS will be enrolled and treated with the SLM or mechanical lumbar traction for 2 weeks. VAS score and SF-36 questionnaire were assessed at baseline and at 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Any signs of acute adverse reactions, such as lower limb paralysis or syndrome of cauda equina, will be recorded at each visit during treatment.Although the SLM has been used in China for many years to treat symptomatic DLS, there is a lack of consensus about its effectiveness. This trial will provide convincing evidence about the effect of SLM on symptomatic DLS.Registered on 6 January 2019; the trial number is ChiCTR1900020519 .",1

To justify posterior-anterior stabilization, which generates higher costs and potentially higher morbidity vs. posterior-only stabilization, clinical trials with sufficient power and adequate methodology are required. This prospective randomized single-centre pilot trial was designed to enable sufficient sample-size calculation for a randomized multicentre clinical trial (RASPUTHINE). METHODS: Patients with a traumatic thoracolumbar (Th11-L2) incomplete burst fracture (Magerl A3.1.1) were randomly assigned either to the interventional group (posterior-anterior) or to the control group (posterior-only). Primary endpoint of the study was the clinical outcome measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 24 months. Radiological outcome was assessed as secondary endpoint by evaluation of mono- and bisegmental kyphotic angulation and monosegmental fusion. RESULTS: 21 patients were randomly assigned to interventional group (n = 9) or control group (n = 12). One posterior-only treated patient showed a severe initial loss of correction resulting in a crossover to additional anterior bisegmental fusion. The ODI measures at the primary study endpoint showed less but insignificant (p = 0.67) disability for the interventional group over the control group (13.3 vs. 19.3%). Comparison of preoperative bisegmental kyphosis in supine position with the bisegmental kyphosis at 24-month FU in upright position showed a worsened kyphosis for the control group (10.7° ? 15.6°), whereas an improved kyphosis (11° ? 8.3°) was detectable for the interventional group. CONCLUSION: The results of this pilot RCT showed less disability for the posterior-anterior group linked with a significant better restoration of the sagittal profile in comparison with the posterior-only group. To detect a clinically significant difference using the ODI and assuming a 20% loss of FU rate, a total of 266 patients have to be studied in the multicentre trial.",1

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty compared with non-surgical management for patients with cancer who have painful VCFs.The Cancer Patient Fracture Evaluation (CAFE) study was a randomised controlled trial at 22 sites in Europe, the USA, Canada, and Australia. We enrolled patients aged at least 21 years who had cancer and one to three painful VCFs. Patients were randomly assigned by a computer-generated minimisation randomisation algorithm to kyphoplasty or non-surgical management (control group). Investigators and patients were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was back-specific functional status measured by the Roland-Morris disability questionnaire (RDQ) score at 1 month. Outcomes at 1 month were analysed by modified intention to treat, including all patients with data available at baseline and at 1 month follow-up. Patients in the control group were allowed to crossover to receive kyphoplasty after 1 month. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00211237.Between May 16, 2005, and March 11, 2008, 134 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to kyphoplasty (n=70) or non-surgical management (n=64). 65 patients in the kyphoplasty group and 52 in the control group had data available at 1 month. The mean RDQ score in the kyphoplasty group changed from 17·6 at baseline to 9·1 at 1 month (mean change -8·3 points, 95% CI -6·4 to -10·2; p<0·0001). The mean score in the control group changed from 18·2 to 18·0 (mean change 0·1 points; 95% CI -0·8 to 1·0; p=0·83). At 1 month, the kyphoplasty treatment effect for RDQ was -8·4 points (95% CI -7·6 to -9·2; p<0·0001). The most common adverse events within the first month were back pain (four of 70 in the kyphoplasty group and five of 64 in the control group) and symptomatic vertebral fracture (two and three, respectively). One patient in the kyphoplasty group had an intraoperative non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, which resolved and was attributed to anaesthesia.

Few of these trials report on the surgical aspects and radiographical vertebral deformity results.Adults with 1 to 3 VCFs were randomized within 3 months of pain to undergo bilateral BKP (n = 149) or NSM (n = 151). Surgical parameters, subjective quality of life assessments and objective functional (timed up and go) and radiographical assessments were collected.Compared with NSM, the BKP group had greater improvements in SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) scores at 1 month (5.35 points; 95% CI, 3.41-7.30; P < 0.0001) and when averaged across the 24 months (overall treatment effect 2.71 points; 95% CI, 1.34-4.09; P = 0.0001). The kyphoplasty group also had greater functionality by assessing timed up and go (overall treatment effect -2.49 s; 95% CI, -0.82 to -4.15; P = 0.0036). At 24 months, the change in index fracture kyphotic angulation was statistically significantly improved in the kyphoplasty group (average 3.13° of correction for kyphoplasty compared with 0.82° in the control, P = 0.003). Number of baseline prevalent fractures (P = 0.0003) and treatment assignment (P = 0.004) are the most predictive variables for PCS improvement; however, in patients who underwent BKP, there may also be a link with kyphotic angulation. In BKP, the highest quart for kyphotic angulation correction had higher PCS improvement (13.4 points) than the quart having lowest correction of angulation (7.40 points, P = 0.0146 for difference). The most common adverse events temporally related to surgery (i.e., within 30 d) were back pain (20 BKP, 11 NSM) new VCF (11 BKP, 7 NSM), nausea/vomiting (12 BKP, 4 NSM), and urinary tract infection (10 BKP, 3 NSM). Several other adverse events were possibly related to patient positioning in the operating room.Compared with NSM, BKP improves patient quality of life and pain averaged during 24 months and results in better improvement of index vertebral body kyphotic angulation. Perioperative complications may be reduced with more care in patient positioning.2.",1

Methodologic quality was assessed and relevant data were retrieved, and appropriate meta-analysis was performed. Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Results and upper bounds of confidence intervals were compared with predefined clinically relevant differences.Six relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,603 patients were identified and reported two year follow-up results. Patients in TDR group compared with lumbar fusion group demonstrated significant improvements in ODI, VAS scores and complication rates at the two year follow-up. Meanwhile, except for operating time in anterior group, intra-operative blood loss, operating time in posterior group, and reoperation rate were without clinical significance between the two groups. In addition, the range of motion (ROM) was maintained within normal ranges after TDR.The results showed the TDR has significant safety and efficacy comparable to lumbar fusion at two year follow-up. Although superiority compared to fusion could not be proved, by comparing clinical symptoms relieved, motion preserved, and the low reoperation rate during long-term follow-up on TDR, TDR was considered safe and effective. Therefore, the authors suggest adopting TDR on a large scale; with failure of TDR, interbody fusion would be performed.",1

In a previous study, we demonstrated the efficacy of a newly developed inflatable balloon catheter for overcoming the access limitations of pre-existing catheters for patients with severe stenosis or adhesions.This study compared the treatment response of combined PEA with balloon decompression and PEA only in patients with central LSS over 6 months of follow-up.This study used a randomized, single-blinded, active-controlled trial design.This study took place in a single-center, academic, outpatient interventional pain management clinic.This randomized controlled study included 60 patients with refractory central LSS who suffered from chronic lower back pain and/or lumbar radicular pain. Patients failed to maintain improvement for > 1 month with epidural steroid injection or PEA using a balloon-less catheter. Patients were randomly assigned to one of 2 interventions: balloon-less (n = 30) and inflatable balloon catheter (n = 30). The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Global Perceived Effect of Satisfaction (GPES), and Medication Quantification Scale III were each measured at 1, 3, and 6 months after PEA.There was a significant difference between groups in NRS-11 reduction ≥ 50% (or 4 points), ODI reduction ≥ 30% (or 10 points), GPES ≥ 6 and ≥ 4 points at 6 months, and NRS-11 reduction ≥ 50% (or 4 points) at 3 months after PEA (P < .03).

In intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, several approaches are used for handling the missing information - complete case (CC) analysis, mixed-effects model (MM) analysis, last observation carried forward (LOCF) and multiple imputation (MI). This report discusses the consequences of applying the CC, LOCF and MI for the ITT analysis of published data (analysed using the MM method) from the Fracture Reduction Evaluation (FREE) trial.The FREE trial was a randomised, non-blinded study comparing balloon kyphoplasty with non-surgical care for the treatment of patients with acute painful vertebral fractures. Patients were randomised to treatment (1:1 ratio), and stratified for gender, fracture aetiology, use of bisphosphonates and use of systemic steroids at the time of enrolment. Six outcome measures - Short-form 36 physical component summary (SF-36 PCS) scale, EuroQol 5-Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D), Roland-Morris Disability (RMD) score, back pain, number of days with restricted activity in last 2 weeks, and number of days in bed in last 2 weeks - were analysed using four methods for dealing with missing data: CC, LOCF, MM and MI analyses.There were no missing data in baseline covariates values, and only a few missing baseline values in outcome variables. The overall missing-response level increased during follow-up (1 month: 14.5%; 24 months: 28%), corresponding to a mean of 19% missing data during the entire period. Overall patterns of missing response across time were similar for each treatment group. Almost half of all randomised patients were not available for a CC analysis, a maximum of 4% were not included in the LOCF analysis, and all randomised patients were included in the MM and MI analyses. Improved estimates of treatment effect were observed with LOCF, MM and MI compared with CC; only MM provided improved estimates across all six outcomes considered.The FREE trial results are robust as the alternative methods used for substituting missing data produced similar results. The MM method showed the highest statistical precision suggesting it is the most appropriate method to use for analysing the FREE trial data.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT00211211).",1

It involves radiographic-guided injection of various types of bone cement directly into the vertebral fracture site. Uncontrolled studies and two controlled quasi-experimental before-after studies comparing volunteers who were offered treatment to those who refused it, have suggested an early benefit including rapid pain relief and improved function. Conversely, several uncontrolled studies and one of the controlled before-after studies have also suggested that vertebroplasty may increase the risk of subsequent vertebral fractures, particularly in vertebrae adjacent to treated levels or if cement leakage into the adjacent disc has occurred. As yet, there are no completed randomised controlled trials of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The aims of this participant and outcome assessor-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial are to i) determine the short-term efficacy and safety (3 months) of vertebroplasty for alleviating pain and improving function for painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures; and ii) determine its medium to longer-term efficacy and safety, particularly the risk of further fracture over 2 years.A double-blind randomised controlled trial of 200 participants with one or two recent painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures.

This study directly compares the efficacy and safety of OP-1 putty to autograft bone for arthrodesis in patients with symptomatic stenosis in association with degenerative spondylolisthesis.Thirty-six patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis and symptoms of neurogenic claudication underwent laminectomy, bilateral medial facetectomy, and posterolateral fusion using either iliac crest autograft or OP-1 Putty. Oswestry scores and SF-36 questionnaires were used to determine the clinical response to treatment. Independent, blinded neuroradiologists reviewed both static and dynamic radiographs to determine the fusion status. Successful fusion was declared whenthe presence of continuous bridging bone between the transverse processes was observed and less than 5 degrees of angular motion and 2 mm of translational movement was measured using digital calipers.Efficacy data were tabulated for 27 patients at the 24-month time point and an additional 4 patients (without evaluable 24-month results) at the 36-month time point. One patient was not evaluable for radiology, so the data reflect clinical information for 31 patients and radiology for 30 patients. Clinical success, defined as a 20% improvement in the preoperative Oswestry score, was achieved by 17 of 20 (85%) OP-1 Putty patients and 7 of 11 (64%) autograft patients. A successful posterolateral fusion was achieved in 11 of 20 (55%) OP-1 Putty patients and 4 of 10 (40%) autograft patients. SF-36 scores showed similar clinical improvement in both groups. No systemic toxicity, ectopic bone formation, recurrent stenosis, or other adverse events specifically related to the use of the OP-1 Putty implant were observed.This study represents the first clinical trial to demonstrate the safety and similarity of OP-1 Putty as a replacement for autogenous bone graft in the posterolateral fusion environment with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. OP-1 Putty was able to achieve osteoinduction leading to a radiographically solid fusion in the absence of autogenous iliac crest bone graft in 55% of the patients at 24 and 36 months. These results compare favorably to the historical fusion rates reported for uninstrumented arthrodesis in this challenging clinical scenario.",1

Surgical options include anterior cervical foraminotomy and fusion or posterior cervical foraminotomy. Controversy remains regarding the preferable surgical approach. Pertinent clinical evidence is limited to low-quality observational reports. Therefore, treatment decisions are predominantly based on the individual surgeon's preference and skill. The study objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of posterior foraminotomy in comparison to anterior foraminotomy with fusion for the treatment of spondylotic foraminal stenosis.This is a multicenter randomized, controlled, parallel group superiority trial. A total of 88 adult patients are allocated in a ratio of 1:1.

However, its clinical significance is still uncertain due to the lack of conclusive data.The study is a randomized, therapy-controlled, two-centre trial conducted in a clinical setting at two university hospitals. If they meet the criteria, outpatients presenting with degenerative disc disease, facet joint arthrosis or spondylolisthesis will be included in the study and randomized into two groups: a control group undergoing conventional fusion surgery (PLIF - posterior lumbar intervertebral fusion), and an intervention group undergoing fusion surgery using a new flexible pedicle screw system (PLIF + ""topping off""), which was brought on the market in 2013. Follow-up examination will take place immediately after surgery, after 6 weeks and after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months.

Only limited evidence exists on how sagittal alignment affects clinical outcome. Anterior lumbar interbody fusion combined with posterolateral fusion has been proved superior to posterolateral fusion alone regarding outcome and cost-effectiveness. No randomized controlled trial has been published analyzing the effect of anterior support on radiographic measurements of sagittal balance.Between 1996 and 1999, 148 patients with severe chronic low back pain were randomly selected for posterolateral lumbar fusion plus anterior support (PLF + ALIF) or posterolateral lumbar fusion. A total of 92 patients participated. Sagittal balance parameters were examined on full lateral radiographs of the spine: pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT), sacral slope, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, and positioning of C7 plumb line. The type of lumbar lordosis was evaluated and outcome assessed by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).Follow-up rate was 74%. Sagittal balance parameters were similar between randomization groups. None of the parameters differed significantly between patients with an ODI from 0 to 40 and patients with ODI over 40. Balanced patients had a significantly superior outcome as measured by ODI (P < 0.05) compared with unbalanced patients.No difference in the investigated sagittal balance parameters was seen between patients treated with PLF + ALIF or posterolateral fusion alone. Lumbar lordosis and type of lordosis correlated with outcome but could not explain the superior outcome in the group with anterior support. Whether sagittal balance and anterior support during fusion provide a protective effect on adjacent motion segments remains unclear.",1

The morbidity of autologous graft and plating, and the doubt about the mechanical efficacy of plate fixation and the clinical benefits in 1-level fusion have promoted the use of other constructs.Sixty-one patients were randomized to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with interbody implant of tantalum (n = 28) or by means of autologous iliac bone graft and plating (n = 33). Fusion rate and segmental height and alignment were blind assessed by radiographs by 2 independent reviewers. Clinical status was evaluated using pain visual analogue scale, the Neck Disability Index, and the Zung Depression Scale. Patient's subjective satisfaction was recorded. Complications and operative parameters were also taken into account.With an endpoint of 24 months, radiologic and clinical outcomes were similar for both treatments without significant difference. The safety of fusion with tantalum implant was obvious, based on the analysis of complications. Complication rate was considerably higher for the autologous graft plus plating procedure than for implant tantalum (P < 0.005).The efficacy to achieve fusion after 1-level anterior cervical discectomy, with a good radiologic and clinical outcome, using tantalum implant is equivalent to that of autologous graft and anterior plate, being safer as avoids donor-site graft harvesting and plating complications.",1

However, to date, long-term follow-up studies have been performed. We performed a retrospective, single-center study to evaluate the outcomes of 2 cohorts from a previous prospective randomized controlled trial comparing stand-alone tantalum cage (group 1, 27 patients) with autologous bone graft and plating (group 2, 30 patients) for single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at 11 years of follow-up. The usual clinical and radiological outcomes and “overall success,” proposed by the Food and Drug Administration, were evaluated. The improvement in clinical outcomes achieved postoperatively was maintained similarly in the 2 cohorts at 11 years of follow-up. In group 1, the cage had subsided 2–3 mm in 12 patients (44%), segmental lordosis was maintained in 16 patients (59%), adjacent segment degeneration had developed or progressed in 27 of the adjacent segments (50%) in 15 patients (56%), and postoperative nonprogressive deformation of the anterior aspect of the cage was observed in 7 (26%) and minor fragmentation in 3 (11%) patients. In group 2, segmental lordosis was maintained in 90% of the patients and adjacent segment degeneration had developed or progressed in 15 patients (50%). These results show that the clinical and radiological outcomes achieved at mid-term follow-up using a tantalum cage for single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion will be maintained for 11 years postoperatively, similar to the results with autologous bone graft and plating. • We examined the outcomes of a porous tantalum implant for single-level ACDF at 11 year follow-up. • The improvement of outcomes achieved at 2- and 5-year follow-up point was maintained ≤11 years postoperatively. • The radiological changes observed over the 11 years did not compromise the clinical outcomes in the long term. • No implant-related complications were observed at the 11-year follow-up point. • There is a high probability of long-lasting good outcomes treating single-level cervical disc degeneration with tantalum cage.",1

Optimal surgical strategies—discectomy decompression and fusion (DDF) or corpectomy decompression and fusion (CDF)—for patients with aggravated symptoms (within 6 months of presentation) are controversial, particularly in those who are ineligible for conventional treatment. These 2 methods of anterior cervical decompression and fusion for MMA in patients unwilling or unable to wear a conventional cervical collar long term were evaluated. Methods Anterior cervical decompression and fusion were performed in 48 male patients with MMA between September 2007 and September 2010. Patients were randomly treated with anterior cervical discectomy decompression with autologous iliac crest bone grafting and internal plate fixation (DDF group: 24 patients) or anterior cervical corpectomy, posterior longitudinal ligament resection, autologous iliac crest bone grafting, and internal plate fixation (CDF group: 24 patients). Subjective symptom assessments and electromyography (EMG) examinations were conducted both preoperatively and postoperatively. Results Subjective assessments and EMG studies (mean follow-up duration 25.9 months) indicated improvement in 64.6% and 60% of patients, respectively. No significant correlations between the effectiveness of surgery and age at symptom onset, preoperative symptom duration, or postoperative follow-up time were found. Conclusions The lack of a significant difference in effectiveness between DDF and CDF favors DDF as more clinically applicable because of its lower procedural risks. As a second-line alternative to cervical collar treatment, surgical anterior cervical decompression and fusion via DDF or CDF may prevent further deterioration and produce good short-term therapeutic effects in patients with MMA; however, cervical collar treatment is recommended for eligible patients because of its lower associated risks.",1

A prerandomization protocol was used to allocate patients to the three arms of the study: a ring implant containing autologous cancellous bone graft, a solid block implant or autologous tricortical iliac crest bone graft. Patients were followed for 2 years with plain radiological studies, SF-36, and Neck Disability Index questionnaires and neurological assessment. Early in the study the postoperative radiographs of four patients receiving Hedrocel implants showed inferior end-plate lucency raising concerns about delayed or non-fusion. Recruitment to the study was halted by the investigators to allow longer-term follow-up of the implanted patients when only 24 patients had been recruited to the study. Although fusion was subsequently noted in all patients at 12 months there was no further enrolment to the study. At 2 years the radiological and clinical outcomes of the three groups appeared comparable, but the study numbers were too small for any statistical analysis. This study highlights the difficulties that can arise when clinical caution takes precedence over objective measures of clinical progress during a study. In the absence of an independent safety monitoring committee, the investigators were under an ethical obligation to suspend recruitment to this study, until it was clear that the radiological features were not associated with poor clinical outcomes. The use of safety monitoring committees and the clarification of stopping criteria in relation to outcome measures should be considered in open randomized trials of spinal surgical techniques and implants.",1

However, harvesting of bone from the iliac crest is associated with complications. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are extensively used as alternatives, often without sufficient evidence of safety and efficacy. The purpose of this study was to investigate non-inferiority of osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1, also known as BMP-7) in comparison with iliac crest bone graft in posterolateral fusions.This study was a randomized, controlled multicenter trial. Patients who underwent a single-level instrumented posterolateral fusion of the lumbar spine for degenerative or isthmic spondylolisthesis with symptoms of neurological compression were randomized to receive OP-1 combined with local bone (OP-1 group) or autologous bone graft from the iliac crest combined with local bone (autograft group). The primary outcome was overall success, defined as a combination of clinical success and evidence of fusion on computed tomography (CT) scans, at one year postoperatively.One hundred and nineteen patients were included in the study, and analysis of the overall outcome was performed for 113. Non-inferiority of OP-1 compared with iliac crest autograft was not found at one year, with a success rate of 40% in the OP-1 group versus 54% in the autograft group (risk difference = -13.3%, 90% confidence interval [CI] = -28.6% to +2.10%). This was due to the lower rate of fusion (the primary aim of OP-1 application) seen on the CT scans in the OP-1 group (54% versus 74% in the autograft group, p = 0.03). There were no adverse events that could be directly related to the use of OP-1.OP-1 with a collagen carrier was not as effective as autologous iliac crest bone for achieving fusion and cannot be recommended in instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion procedures.Therapeutic Level I.

Numerous preclinical investigations have demonstrated efficacy of osteoinductive proteins in spinal fusion, but few human clinical studies have been reported.Nineteen patients with L3-L4 or L4-L5 degenerative spondylolisthesis underwent posterolateral lumbar fusion using pedicle screw instrumentation. The patients were randomized to receive either OP-1 Putty (3.5 mg OP-1/g of collagen matrix per side) alone (n = 9), or local autograft with HA-TCP granules (n = 10). Fusion status was evaluated using plain radiography and CT scan. Radiographic fusion criteria included less than 5 degrees of angular motion, less than 2 mm of translation, and evidence of bridging bone in the posterolateral lumbar area in which the graft materials were placed following decortication. After a minimum 1-year follow-up, the patients who showed radiographic evidence of fusion underwent instrumentation removal and surgical exploration of the fusion site. Biopsy specimens were taken from the fusion mass and evaluated histologically.Radiographic fusion rate was 7 of 9 OP-1 patients and 9 of 10 control patients. Based on surgical exploration of these 16 patients, new bone formation was macroscopically observed in the posterolateral lumbar region in all cases; however, solid fusion was observed in 4 of 7OP-1 and 7 of 9 HA-TCP/autograft patients. Histologic assessment demonstrated viable bone in 6 of 7 OP-1 patients. All the control (HA-TCP/autograft) specimens contained viable bone and fibrous tissue surrounding ceramic granules, suggesting slow incorporation of the graft material.In a human posterolateral lumbar spine trial, OP-1 reliably induced viable amounts of new bone formation, but the fusion success rate evaluated by surgical exploration was only 4 of 7.",1

The surgical procedure combined posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) and PLF with internal fixation over one or two levels using silicated calcium phosphate (SiCaP) or bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 as graft material in patients with a degenerative disorder of the lumbar spine. Summary of background data Few controlled trials have evaluated the bone graft materials available to surgeons treating patients with spinal disorders, including degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis, and disc herniation. Methods Following randomization, the surgical procedure consisting of PLIF and PLF with internal fixation over one or two levels was performed using SiCaP or BMP-2. No other osteoconductive/osteoinductive graft materials were permitted. Spinal fusion was assessed radiographically at ≤24 months. Clinical outcomes (pain on visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, SF-36) and adverse events (AEs) were monitored. Results One hundred three patients were enrolled. At 12 months, fusion was achieved in 25 of 35 (71.4%) of the SiCaP and 20 of 27 (74.1%) of the BMP-2 group, respectively (P = 1.000). At 24 months, the fusion rate was 78.6% and 84.8% for SiCaP and BMP-2, respectively (P = 0.5613). Clinical outcomes improved similarly in both groups over time. AEs were consistent with this surgical population.

The prevalence and the cause of ASD are not well documented, but ASD are one of the main arguments for introducing the use of motion-preserving techniques as an alternative to fusion. Anterior lumbar interbody fusion combined with posterolateral lumbar fusion (ALIF+PLF) has been proved superior to posterolateral fusion alone regarding outcome and cost-effectiveness.Between 1996 and 1999, 148 patients with severe chronic low back pain were randomly selected for ALIF+PLF or for PLF alone. Ninety-five patients participated. ASD was examined on magnetic resonance imaging with regard to disc degeneration, disc herniation, stenosis, and endplate changes. Disc heights on radiographs taken at index surgery and at long-term follow-up were compared. Outcome was assessed by validated questionnaires.The follow-up rate was 76%. ASD was similar between randomization groups. In the total cohort, endplate changes were seen in 26% of the participants and correlated significantly with the presence of disc degeneration and disc herniation. Disc degeneration and dorsal disc herniation were the parameters registered most frequently and were significantly more pronounced at the first adjacent level than at the second and the third adjacent levels. Patients without disc height reduction over time were significantly younger than patients with disc height reduction. Disc degeneration and stenosis correlated significantly with outcome at the first adjacent level.The cause of the superior outcome in the group with anterior support is still unclear. Compared with the findings reported in the literature, the prevalence of ASD is likely to be in concordance with the expected changes in a nonoperated symptomatic population and therefore not accelerated by fusion.",1

We then followed up on their condition for a mean of 9.1±1.9 years (5.6-12.2 y) later.We aimed to evaluate the annual rate of clinically symptomatic adjacent segment disease (ASD) and to analyze predictive factors.Until recent, ASD has been predominantly evaluated radiologically. It is not known whether all patients had complaints. A frequent cited annual rate of ASD is 2.9%, but a growing number of studies report a lower annual rate. Furthermore, maintaining motion to prevent ASD is one reason for implanting a cervical disk prosthesis. However, the results of studies contradict one another.Participants took part in a randomized controlled trial that ended prematurely because of the publication of evidence that did not justify continuation of the trial. The patients were randomly allocated to 3 groups, each of which received one of the abovementioned treatments. We defined symptomatic ASD as signs and symptoms caused by degeneration of an intervertebral disk adjacent to a level of previous anterior cervical disk surgery. At the last follow-up, we were able to ascertain whether clinically symptomatic ASD was present in any of the participants.The overall annual rate of symptomatic ASD was 0.7%. We found no statistically significant correlations between any of the investigated factors and symptomatic ASD except for the surgical method used. Symptomatic ASD was seen less often in anterior cervical discectomy solely or anterior cervical discectomy with arthroplasty than in anterior cervical discectomy with fusion by plate fixation.The annual rate of symptomatic ASD after an anterior cervical discectomy procedure was estimated to be 0.7%.

Dexamethasone, although potentially protective against perioperative dysphagia and airway compromise, could inhibit fusion, a generally proinflammatory process. The authors conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study of the effects of steroids on swallowing, the airway, and arthrodesis related to multilevel anterior cervical reconstruction in patients who were undergoing ACDF at Albany Medical Center between 2008 and 2012. The objective of this study was to determine if perioperative steroid use improves perioperative dysphagia and airway edema. METHODS A total of 112 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive saline or dexamethasone. Data gathered included demographics, functional status (including modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association myelopathy score, neck disability index, 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey score, and patient-reported visual analog scale score of axial and radiating pain), functional outcome swallowing scale score, interval postoperative imaging, fusion status, and complications/reoperations. Follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, and CT was performed 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery for fusion assessment. RESULTS Baseline demographics were not significantly different between the 2 groups, indicating adequate randomization. In terms of patient-reported functional and pain-related outcomes, there were no differences in the steroid and placebo groups. However, the severity of dysphagia in the postoperative period up to 1 month proved to be significantly lower in the steroid group than in the placebo group (p = 0.027). Furthermore, airway difficulty and a need for intubation trended toward significance in the placebo group (p = 0.057). Last, fusion rates at 6 months proved to be significantly lower in the steroid group but lost significance at 12 months (p = 0.048 and 0.57, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Dexamethasone administered perioperatively significantly improved swallowing function and airway edema and shortened length of stay.

This is the first placebo-controlled study to assess the effect of an electromagnetic stimulus on primary noninstrumented posterolateral lumbar spine fusion surgery as well as the first evaluation of combined magnetic fields as an adjunctive stimulus to lumbar spine fusion.This multicenter investigational study was conducted at 10 clinical sites under an Investigational Device Exemption from the United States Food and Drug Administration. Eligible patients had one-level or two-level fusions (between L3 and S1) without instrumentation, either with autograft alone or in combination with allograft. The combined magnetic field device used a single posterior coil, centered over the fusion site, with one 30-minute treatment per day for 9 months. Randomization was stratified by site and number of levels fused. Evaluation was performed 3, 6, and 9 months after surgery and 3 months after the end of treatment. The primary endpoint was assessment of fusion at 9 months, based on radiographic evaluation by a blinded panel consisting of the treating physician, a musculoskeletal radiologist, and a spine surgeon.Of 243 enrolled patients, 201 were available for evaluation. Among all patients with active devices, 64% healed at 9 months compared with 43% of patients with placebo devices: a significant difference (P = 0.003 by Fisher's exact test). Stratification by gender showed fusion in 67% of women with active devices, compared with 35% of those with placebo devices (P = 0.001 by Fisher's exact test). By contrast, there was not a statistically significant effect of the active device in this male study population. In the overall population of 201 patients, repeated measures analyses of fusion outcomes (by generalized estimating equations) showed a main effect of treatment, favoring the active treatment (P = 0.030). In a model with main effect and a time by treatment interaction, the latter was significant (P = 0.024), indicating acceleration of healing. Performed in the full sample of 243 patients, results of the intent-to-treat analysis were qualitatively the same as in the evaluable sample of 201 patients.This investigational study demonstrates that combined magnetic field treatment of 30 min/d increases the probability of successful spine fusion, and statistical analysis using the generalized estimating equations model suggests an acceleration of the healing process. This is the first randomized clinical trial of noninstrumented primary posterolateral lumbar spine fusion, with evaluation by a blinded, unbiased panel. This is the first double-blind study performed to date assessing noninstrumented fusion outcome with extremely critical radiographic criteria. The lower overall fusion rates in this study are attributed to the high-risk patient group with an average age of 57 years, the use of noninstrumented technique with posterolateral fusion only, and the reliance on extremely critical radiographic and clinical criteria and blinded panel for fusion assessment without surgical confirmation.In conclusion, the adjunctive use of the combined magnetic field device was statistically beneficial in the overall patient population, as has been shown in previous studies of adjunctive bone growth stimulation for spine fusion. For the first time, stratification of fusion success data by gender demonstrated that the female study population responded positively to the adjunctive combined magnetic field treatment, with no statistically significant effect observed in the male study population. Adjunctive use of the combined magnetic field device significantly increased the 9-month success of radiographic spinal fusion and showed an acceleration of the healing process.",1

Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one (n=34 patients) received rhBMP-2 on a collagen sponge carrier; the other (n=33 patients) autogenous iliac crest bone graft.Clinical outcomes were measured using low back and leg pain numerical rating scales, the Short Form (SF)-36, Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire and work status. Plain radiographs and computed tomographic scans were used to evaluate fusion at 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery.In this prospective nonblinded study, 67 patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups who underwent interbody fusion using two cylindrical threaded fusion cages: the investigational group (34 patients), who received rhBMP-2 on an absorbable collagen sponge, and a control group (33 patients), who received autogenous iliac crest bone graft. Clinical data were collected and analyzed by a commercial entity.The mean operative time and blood loss for the investigational rhBMP-2 group was 2.6 hours and 322.8 ml, respectively. For the autograft control group, these values were 3.0 hours and 372.7 ml. The differences were not significant. Although not statistically different, at 24 months, the investigational group's fusion rate of 92.3% was higher than the control's at 77.8%. At all postoperative intervals, the mean Oswestry, back and leg pain scores and physical components of the SF-36 improved in both treatment groups compared with preoperative scores, but no significant differences were found between groups. A statistically significant difference in the change in back pain was found at 24 months for the investigational group. In the control group, two adverse events related to harvesting of the iliac crest graft occurred in two patients (6.1%).This small multicenter, randomized, nonblinded trial showed few statistically significant differences between the study groups. Both groups showed comparable improvements on outcome scores. Overall results show that the use of rhBMP-2 can eliminate the need for harvesting iliac crest graft and may be an equivalent replacement for autograft for use in successful posterior lumbar interbody fusions. Further studies of the use of rhBMP-2 in posterior lumbar interbody fusion cage procedures are needed.",1

The investigational group received a fibular allograft (CORNERSTONE-SR Allograft Ring) with an rhBMP-2-laden collagen carrier inside the graft along with an ATLANTIS anterior cervical plate. The control group received a fibular allograft with cancellous iliac crest autograft placed inside it, along with an ATLANTIS anterior cervical plate. The patients underwent plain radiographs at 6 weeks, then at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, and CT scans at 3 and 6 months after surgery. They also completed general health profiles and self-evaluation scales. Adverse events were evaluated for severity, duration, association with the implant, and the need for a second surgical procedure.All the patients evaluated had solid fusions 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. There were no device-related adverse events. At 24 months, the investigational group had mean improvement superior to that of the control group in neck disability and arm pain scores (P < 0.03 each).This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of using rhBMP-2 safely and effectively in the cervical spine.",1

Patients were evaluated with radiographs, sagittally reformatted computed tomography scans, and Short Form-36 and Oswestry outcome questionnaires.All 11 patients who received rhBMP-2 were judged by three independent radiologists to have solid fusions (at 6, 12, and 24 months postimplantation), whereas only 2 of the 3 control patients, who received the standard treatment of autogenous iliac crest bone, were deemed to be fused. The Oswestry Disability Questionnaire scores of the rhBMP-2 group improved sooner (after 3 months) than those of the autograft group, with both groups demonstrating similar improvement at 6 months. Short Form 36 scores continued to improve up to 24 months.The arthrodesis was found to occur more reliably in patients treated with rhBMP-2-filled fusion cages than in controls treated with autogenous bone graft, although the sample size was limited. There were no adverse events related to the rhBMP-2 treatment. This study is one of the first to show consistent and unequivocal osteoinduction by a recombinant growth factor in-humans.",1

Biologic induction of bone growth has become a commonly used adjunct in obtaining this objective. We undertook this study to objectify the efficacy of rhBMP-2 compared with traditional iliac crest autograft in instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion.Patients undergoing 1- or 2-level instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion were randomized to receive either autograft or rhBMP-2 for their fusion construct. Clinical and radiographical outcome measures were followed for 2 to 4 years postoperatively.One hundred ninety seven patients were successfully randomized among the 8 participating institutions. Adverse events attributable to the study drug were not significantly different compared with controls. However, the control group experienced significantly more graft-site complications as might be expected. 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, Oswestry Disability Index, and leg/back pain scores were comparable between the 2 groups. After 4 years of follow-up, radiographical fusion rates remained significantly higher in patients treated with rhBMP-2 (94%) than those who received autograft (69%) (P = 0.007).The use of rhBMP-2 for instrumented posterolateral lumbar surgery significantly improves the chances of radiographical fusion compared with the use of autograft. However, there is no associated improvement in clinical outcome within a 4-year follow-up period. These results suggest that use of rhBMP-2 should be considered in cases where lumbar arthrodesis is of primary concern.",1

The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of lumbar fusion with posterior transpedicular screws and cognitive intervention and exercises. Sixty patients aged 25-60 years with low back pain lasting longer than 1 year after previous surgery for disc herniation were randomly allocated to the two treatment groups. Experienced back surgeons performed transpedicular fusion. Cognitive intervention consisted of a lecture intended to give the patient an understanding that ordinary physical activity would not harm the disc and a recommendation to use the back and bend it. This was reinforced by three daily physical exercise sessions for 3 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Outcome data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Ninety-seven percent of the patients, including seven of eight patients who had either not attended treatment (n=5) or changed groups (n=2), completed 1-year follow-up. ODI was significantly improved from 47 to 38 after fusion and from 45 to 32 after cognitive intervention and exercises. The mean difference between treatments after adjustment for gender was -7.3 (95% CI -17.3 to 2.7, p=0.15). The success rate was 50% in the fusion group and 48% in the cognitive intervention/exercise group.

The relative efficacy of surgery over nonoperative treatment for the treatment of cLBP remains controversial, and little is known of the long-term comparative outcomes.To compare the clinical outcome at long-term follow-up (LTFU) of patients who were randomized with either spinal fusion or multidisciplinary cognitive-behavioral and exercise rehabilitation for cLBP.Long-term clinical follow-up of three multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of surgery (instrumented or noninstrumented fusion, stabilization) versus nonoperative treatment (multidisciplinary cognitive-behavioral and exercise rehabilitation) in Norway and the United Kingdom.A total of 473 patients with cLBP of at least 1 year's duration who were all considered candidates for spinal fusion.The primary outcome was the Oswestry Disability Index (ODIv2.1a for the United Kingdom and ODIv1 for Norway) score measured at LTFU. Secondary outcomes included visual analog scale (VAS) pain intensity, pain frequency, pain medication use, work status, EuroQol VAS for health-related quality of life, satisfaction with care, and global treatment outcome at LTFU.Patients who consented to LTFU (average 11.4 [range 8-15] years after the initial treatment) completed the outcome questionnaires.Of 473 enrolled patients, 261 (55%) completed LTFU, 140/242 patients randomized to receive surgery and 121/231 randomized to receive multidisciplinary cognitive-behavioral and exercise rehabilitation. The intention-to-treat analysis showed no statistically or clinically significant differences between treatment groups for ODI scores at LTFU (adjusted for baseline ODI, previous surgery, duration of LBP, sex, age, and smoking habit): the mean adjusted treatment effect of fusion was -0.7 points on the 0-100 ODI scale (95% confidence interval [CI], -5.5 to 4.2). An as-treated analysis similarly demonstrated no advantage of surgery (treatment effect, -0.8 points on the ODI (95% CI, -5.9 to 4.3). The results for the secondary outcomes were largely consistent with those of the ODI, showing no relevant group differences.After an average of 11 years follow-up, there was no difference in patient self-rated outcomes between fusion and multidisciplinary cognitive-behavioral and exercise rehabilitation for cLBP. The results suggest that, given the increased risks of surgery and the lack of deterioration in nonoperative outcomes over time, the use of lumbar fusion in cLBP patients should not be favored in health care systems where multidisciplinary cognitive-behavioral and exercise rehabilitation programmes are available.",1

The theoretical assumption that TDA may reduce the incidence of future ALD by preserving motion at the affected segments has, however, never been validated by clinical evidence.One hundred seventy patients with established symptomatic cervical disc disease at 1 or 2 levels participated in 3 prospective randomized clinical trials at 2 institutions. Participating subjects were randomized to receive TDA (treatment; n = 113) or ACDF (control; n = 57) by 6 independent investigating surgeons. Visual analogue pain scores (0-100), Neck Disability Index, neurological examination, and cervical spine radiographs were collected at enrollment and then 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after surgery. Patients with persistent symptoms during the follow-up period were investigated for adjacent segment disease (ASD) with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine, neurophysiology, and subsequent active interventions.At the median follow-up of 42 months (range: 28-54 months), 9 (14.3%) ACDF and 19 (16.8%) TDA patients developed and were actively treated for ASD.

Bone graft alternatives, such as recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rh-BMP2), are now widely used but also have unique risk profiles and substantially increase costs. The purpose of the current study was to compare the efficacy of rh-BMP2 and synthetic silicate calcium phosphate (SiCaP) as bone graft substitutes on fusion rates and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing single-level lumbar stand-alone extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF).A prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical, and radiographic study was performed at a single institution. Thirty patients with L4-L5 degenerative disc disease (DDD) were enrolled. Patients were randomized into one of two groups, 15 underwent lumbar single-level stand-alone XLIF using SiCaP, and 15 using rh-BMP2. Clinical and radiographic results were compared between the study groups. Pain (visual analogue scale) and disability (Oswestry disability index) were assessed preoperatively and at postoperative weeks 1 and 6 and postoperative months 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36. Radiographic evaluations were performed at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Neurological examinations and adverse events were recorded at each visit.No intraoperative complications were observed in either treatment group, and clinical outcomes were similarly improved between bone graft substitutes from baseline to 36 months postoperative. Complications were transient hip flexion weakness (13%), insufficient indirect decompression (7%), subsidence (17%), excessive bone formation (4%), and adjacent segment disease (14%). Complication rates between the groups were similar, though with slightly more instances of subsidence in the SiCaP group and higher rates of excessive bone formation and adjacent segment disease in the rh-BMP2 group. Rates of fusion at different time points were different between the groups, with the SiCaP patients progressing more slowly toward solid fusion. However, at 36 months, 100% of patients undergoing XLIF achieved solid fusion.In stand-alone XLIF, SiCaP and rhBMP-2 bone graft substitutes both resulted in complete long-term fusion. rhBMP-2, however, seemed to result in more rapid early postoperative fusion, though with one instance of excessive bone formation in one patient that required subsequent surgical intervention.",1

Although anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has been the standard of care, a recent RCT suggested similar outcomes for 2-level disease. The quality-of-life benefit afforded by both CTDR and ACDF has never been fully elucidated. The purpose of our investigation was to better define the changes in utility and perceived value for patients undergoing these procedures.Data were derived from LDR's RCT comparing CTDR and ACDF for 2-level cervical disc disease. Using linear regression, we constructed health states on the basis of the stratification of clinical outcomes used in the RCT, namely, neck disability index and visual analogue scale. Data from SF-12 questionnaires, completed preoperatively and at each follow-up visit, were transformed into utilities using the SF-6D mapping algorithm. SAS v.9.3 was used for the analyses.A strong correlation (R = 0.6864, P < 0.0001) was found between neck disability index and visual analogue scale. We constructed 5 distinct health states by projecting neck disability index intervals onto visual analogue scale. A poorer health state was associated with a lower mean utility value whereas a higher health state was associated with a higher mean utility value (P < 0.0001). The difference in preoperative utility between 2-level ACDF and CTDR was not significant (P = 0.1982), and yet, the difference in the postoperative utility between the cohorts was significant (P < 0.05) at every time point collected from 6 to 60 months.This is the first instance in which distinct utility values have been derived for validated health states related to cervical spine disease. There is substantial potential for these to become baseline future indices for cost-utility analyses in similar populations.1.",1

Clinical studies with short-term follow-up have yet to demonstrate a consistent significant difference in the incidence of adjacent segment disease.Two hundred nine patients at 13 sites were treated in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of ACDF versus TDA for single-level symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease (SCDD). Flexion and extension radiographs were obtained at all follow-up visits. Changes in ROM were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Predictors of postoperative ROM were determined by multivariate analysis using mixed effects linear regression.Data for 199 patients were available with 24-month follow-up. The groups were similar with respect to baseline demographics. A significant increase in motion at the cranial and caudal adjacent segments after surgery was observed in the ACDF group only (cranial: ACDF: +1.4° (0.4, 2.4), P = 0.01; TDA: +0.8°, (-0.1, +1.7), P = 0.166; caudal: ACDF: +2.6° (1.3, 3.9), P < 0.0001; TDA: +1.3, (-0.2, +2.8), P = 0.359). No significant difference in adjacent segment ROM was observed between ACDF and TDA. Only time was a significant predictor of postoperative ROM at both the cranial and caudal adjacent segments.Adjacent segment kinematics may be altered after ACDF and TDA. Multivariate analysis showed time to be a significant predictor of changes in adjacent segment ROM. No association between the treatment chosen (ACDF vs. TDA) and ROM was observed. Furthermore clinical follow-up is needed to determine whether possible differences in adjacent segment motion affect the prevalence of adjacent segment disease in the two groups.",1

We aimed to investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine on somatosensory, motor, and visual EPs.After IRB approval, 40 adult patients scheduled for elective spine surgery using total IV anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil were randomly assigned to receive either dexmedetomidine (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. After obtaining informed consent, positioning, and baseline EPs recording, patients were randomly assigned to either IV dexmedetomidine 0.6 μg/kg infused over 10 minutes, followed by 0.6 μg/kg/h, or a corresponding volume of IV normal saline (placebo). EP measures at 60 ± 30 minutes after initiation of study drug were defined as T1 and at 150 ± 30 minutes were defined as T2. Changes from baseline to T1 (primary end point) and from baseline to T2 (secondary end point) in EP latencies (milliseconds) and amplitudes (microvolts) were compared between groups. Data presented as mean ± SD (95% confidence interval).Data from 40 patients (dexmedetomidine: n = 20; age, 54 ± 3 years; 10 males; placebo: n = 20; age, 52 ± 2 years; 5 males) were analyzed. There was no difference between dexmedetomidine versus placebo groups in primary end points: change of somatosensory EPs at T1, latency: 0.01 ± 1.3 (-0.64, 0.65) vs 0.01 ± 1.3 (-0.64, 0.65), P = 0.43 (-1.24, 0.45); amplitude: 0.03 ± 0.14 (-0.06, 0.02) vs -0.01 ± 0.13 (-0.07, 0.05), P = 0.76 (-0.074, 0.1); motor EPs amplitude at T1: 65.1 ± 194.8 (-35, 165; n = 18) vs 109.2 ± 241.4 (-24, 243; n = 16), P = 0.57 (-113.5, 241.57); visual EPs at T1 (right eye), amplitude: 2.3 ± 3.6 (-0.4, 5.1; n = 11) vs 0.3 ± 6.0 (-3.3, 3.9; n = 16), P = 0.38 (-6.7, 2.6); latency N1: 2.3 ± 3.6 (-0.4, 5.1) vs 0.3 ± 6.0 (-3.3, 3.9), P = 0.38 (-6.7, 2.6); latency P1: -1.6 ± 13.4 (-11.9, 8.7) vs -1.4 ± 8.1 (-6.3, 3.5), P = 0.97 (-9.3, 9.7) or secondary end points.

Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid (TXA) administered during the surgical correction of thoracolumbar fracture-dislocation. Summary of background data Thoracolumbar fracture-dislocation surgery is generally associated with substantial blood loss and a high risk of deep vein thrombosis. TXA has been shown to improve hemostasis in surgical procedures. Methods We investigated 80 patients with thoracolumbar fracture-dislocation who underwent transforaminal thoracic interbody fusion between March 2014 and December 2016. The patients were randomized into the TXA (n = 39) and Placebo (n = 41) groups, according to whether they did or did not receive pre- and intraoperative TXA treatment. The two groups were compared for demographic characteristics as well as pre- and postoperative levels of prethrombosis-state molecular markers and visible and hidden blood loss volumes. Additionally, the prevalence of TXA-related complications was determined. Results The two groups did not differ significantly in demographic characteristics. The visible blood loss (intra- and postoperative bleeding during the first 24 h), hidden blood loss, and true total blood loss during surgery in the TXA group were significantly lower than those in the Placebo group (835 ± 180.3 mL, 351 ± 82.3 mL, 1385 ± 102.3 mL vs. 1155 ± 175.3 mL, 564 ± 170.5 mL, 1683 ± 121.0 mL, respectively; P 0.05).

The accuracy of pedicle screw placement was evaluated using postoperative computed tomography. The primary outcome was the CUSUM analysis for monitoring the quality control of the accuracy of pedicle screw insertion between the Rom-PLIF and conventional open posterior PLIF using freehand technique groups.Of the 80 pedicle screws inserted in each group, 4 screws in the Rom-PLIF group, and 7 in the conventional open PLIF group, breached the pedicle. Of these 11 offending screws, 4 cases were categorized as grade B in the Rom-PLIF group, whereas 6 were grade B and 1 case was grade C in the Com-PLIF group, using the Gertzbein and Robbins classification.

In addition, there have been no studies about the biomechanical issues between both techniques.This study aimed to investigate the biomechanical properties in terms of stress at adjacent segments using robot-assisted pedicle screw insertion technique (robot-assisted, minimally invasive posterior lumbar interbody fusion, Rom-PLIF) and freehand technique (conventional, freehand, open approach, posterior lumbar interbody fusion, Cop-PLIF) for instrumented lumbar fusion surgery.This is an additional post-hoc analysis for patient-specific finite element (FE) model.The sample is composed of patients with degenerative lumbar disease.Intradiscal pressure and facet contact force are the outcome measures.Patients were randomly assigned to undergo an instrumented PLIF procedure using a Rom-PLIF (37 patients) or a Cop-PLIF (41), respectively. Five patients in each group were selected using a simple random sampling method after operation, and 10 preoperative and postoperative lumbar spines were modeled from preoperative high-resolution computed tomography of 10 patients using the same method for a validated lumbar spine model. Under four pure moments of 7.5 Nm, the changes in intradiscal pressure and facet joint contact force at the proximal adjacent segment following fusion surgery were analyzed and compared with preoperative states.The representativeness of random samples was verified. Both groups showed significant increases in postoperative intradiscal pressure at the proximal adjacent segment under four moments, compared with the preoperative state. The Cop-PLIF models demonstrated significantly higher percent increments of intradiscal pressure at proximal adjacent segments under extension, lateral bending, and torsion moments than the Rom-PLIF models (p=.032, p=.008, and p=.016, respectively). Furthermore, the percent increment of facet contact force was significantly higher in the Cop-PLIF models under extension and torsion moments than in the Rom-PLIF models (p=.016 under both extension and torsion moments).The present study showed the clinical application of subject-specific FE analysis in the spine. Even though there was biomechanical superiority of the robot-assisted insertions in terms of alleviation of stress increments at adjacent segments after fusion, cautious interpretation is needed because of the small sample size.",1

Lumbar spine instability is defined as an abnormal response to applied loads characterized kinematically by abnormal movement in the motion segment beyond normal constraints. Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) typically present with low back pain (LBP), cramping, cauda equine syndrome, and signs of nerve root compression associated by weakness, numbness and tingling in their legs that are worsened with standing and walking. This degenerative condition severely restricts function, walking ability, and quality of life (QOL). Objectives: This study aims to compare clinical and radiological outcomes of posterolateral fusion (PLF) with posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with posterior instrumentation in the treatment of LSS and degenerative instability. Study Design: A randomized, prospective, controlled clinical study. Methods: In this prospective study, 88 patients with LSS and degenerative instability were randomly allocated to one of 2 groups: PLF (Group I) or PLIF (Group II). Primary outcomes were the control of LBP and radicular pain, evaluated with visual analog scale (VAS), the improvement of QOL assessed by the Oswestry disability index (ODI) scale, and measurement of fusion rate, Cobb angle, spinal sagittal balance, and modic changes in the 2 groups. Results: At 24 months postoperatively, the mean reduction in VAS scores in Group I was more than in Group II (5.67 vs. 5.48, respectively) and the patients in Group I had more improvement in the ODI score than the patients in Group II (42.75 vs. 40.94, respectively). There was a statistically significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative sagittal balance in the 2 groups. The mean Cobb angle changed significantly in the 2 groups. Limitations: There are few prospective studies of PLIF or PLF in patients with LSS and degenerative lumbar spine instability, and a limited number of studies which exists have examined the safety and outcome of each procedure without comparing it with other fusion techniques. Because most of the studies in the literature have been conducted in the patients with IS, we could not compare and contrast our findings with studies in patients with LSS and degenerative lumbar spine instability. In addition, although in our study the findings at a 24-month follow-up period showed that PLF was better than PLIF in these patients, there were some studies in which the authors reported that PLIF showed better clinical results than PLF at a 48-month followup period. So we suggest that rigorous controlled trials at longer follow-up periods should be undertaken in groups of patients with LSS and degenerative lumbar spine instability who undergo posterior decompression and instrumented fusion to help to determine the ultimate best fusion technique for these patients. Conclusion: PLF with posterior instrumentation provides better clinical outcomes and improvement in the LBP, radicular pain, and functional QOL, more correction of the Cobb angle, more restoration of sagittal alignment, more decrease in Modic type 1, and more increase in Modic type 0, despite the low fusion rate compared to PLIF.

The two approaches have not been directly compared, however, and consensus is lacking as to which is the optimal method. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether acute postoperative morbidity differed between anteriorly and posteriorly treated patients with unilateral facet injuries. Methods Forty-two patients were prospectively randomized to undergo either anterior cervical discectomy and fusion or posterior fixation. The primary outcome measure was the postoperative time required to achieve a predefined set of discharge criteria. Secondary outcome measures included postoperative pain, wound infections, radiographically demonstrated fusion and alignment, and patient-reported outcome measures. Results The median time to achieve the discharge criteria was 2.75 and 3.5 days for anterior and posterior groups, respectively, a difference that did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.096). Compared with those treated using posterior fixation, anteriorly treated patients exhibited somewhat less postoperative pain, a lower rate of wound infection, a higher rate of radiographically demonstrated union, and better radiographically proven alignment. Nonetheless, the anterior approach was accompanied by a risk of swallowing difficulty in the early postoperative period. Patient-reported outcome measures did not reveal a difference between anterior and posterior fixation procedures. Conclusions This prospective randomized controlled trial provided level 1 evidence that both the anterior and posterior fixation approaches appear to be valid treatment options. Although statistical significance was not reached in the primary outcome measure, some secondary outcome measures favored anterior fixation and others favored posterior treatment for unilateral facet injuries.",1

METHODS: Patients (n = 80) with chronic low back pain and single-level degenerative disc were randomly assigned to the SA PLIF (n = 40) or PLIF with PF (n = 40). The primary radiological outcome was the evaluation of a long-term (±6 years; range 6.0-7.7 years) stable construct measured by dynamic X-rays. CT scan does not allow judging the bony bridging between vertebrae, because of Tantalum artefacts. The clinical evaluation (6 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months) consisted of the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score, intensity of low back pain (Visual Analogue Scale) and quality of life (Short Form-36). RESULTS: At 6-year follow-up, X-rays showed a stable construct in 94 % of patients treated by SA TM-500 spacers and in 97 % of those with additional PF. Neither subsidence nor migration was observed in either the SA or the PF group. The average improvement in ODI scores at 24-month clinical follow-up was 14.4 and 13.8 for the SA and PF group, respectively. The VAS score showed an average improvement of 6.4 (SA) and 6.7 (PF), 2 years after implantation. No significant difference between groups was observed at all the evaluation points. CONCLUSION: In this study, TM spacers were found to provide a solid construct at more than 6-year follow-up after PLIF for DDD both with and without additional pedicle fixation. The clinical, but also radiological results were not significantly different between both cohorts. Future studies focusing on the differences of SA and PF at L4/5 level should be powered to study differences in post-surgery stability at the long term.",1

Peripheral nerve block provide site-specific pain relief with few side effects, thereby reducing surgical stress and enhancing quality of recovery. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of a superficial cervical plexus block (SCPB) on postoperative quality of recovery and analgesia in patients undergoing elective anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).After Research Ethics Board approval, we enrolled adults (> 18 yr) scheduled for elective single- or two-level ACDF in this randomized double-blind clinical trial. Participants were randomized to receive either a SCPB (0.25% bupivacaine, 10 mL) or No Block. The primary outcome measure was the quality of recovery at 24 hr, measured using the 40-item quality of recovery questionnaire (QoR-40). In addition, comparisons between groups were also made for postoperative opioid consumption and discharge times.Forty-six patients were randomized to receive either a SCPB block (n = 23) or No Block (n = 23). Median [interquartile range] aggregated global QoR-40 scores at 24 hr were significantly greater in the SCPB group, indicating good quality of recovery compared with the No Block group (179 [116-195] vs 157 [97-196], respectively; median difference, 22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7 to 34; P = 0.002]. There were no differences between the SCPB and the No Block group with regard to mean (standard deviation) postoperative opioid consumption at 24 hr [22.9 (13.6) mg vs 24.6 (9.5) mg, respectively; mean difference 1.7; 95% CI, -5.2 to 8.7; P = 0.620] and the number of patients discharged within 24 hr (15 vs 12, respectively; P = 0.550).We showed that preoperative SCPB is an effective strategy for improving the early quality of recovery in patients undergoing single- or two-level ACDF. Nevertheless, there was no impact on opioid consumption or discharge times. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01662219).",1

The evidence for efficacy of IDET is weak coming from retrospective and prospective cohort studies providing only Class II and Class III evidence. There is one study published with Class I evidence. This demonstrates statistically significant improvements following IDET; however, the clinical significance of these improvements is questionable.Patients with CDLBP who failed to improve following conservative therapy were considered for this study. Inclusion criteria included the presence of one- or two-level symptomatic disc degeneration with posterior or posterolateral anular tears as determined by provocative computed tomography (CT) discography. Patients were excluded if there was greater than 50% loss of disc height or previous spinal surgery. Fifty-seven patients were randomized with a 2:1 ratio: 38 to IDET and 19 to sham procedure (placebo). In all cases, the IDET catheter was positioned to cover at least 75% of the annular tear as defined by the CT discography. An independent technician connected the catheter to the generator and then either delivered electrothermal energy (active group) or did not (sham group). Surgeon, patient, and independent outcome assessor were all blinded to the treatment. All patients followed a standard postprocedural rehabilitation program. Independent statistical analysis was performed.Low Back Outcome Score (LBOS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short Form 36 questionnaire (SF-36), Zung Depression Index (ZDI), and Modified Somatic Perceptions Questionnaire (MSPQ) were measured at baseline and 6 months. Successful outcome was defined as: no neurologic deficit, improvement in LBOS of greater then 7 points, and improvement in SF-36 subsets (physical function and bodily pain) of greater than 1 standard deviation.Baseline demographic data, initial LBOS, ODI, SF-36, ZDI, and MSPQ were similar for both groups. No neurologic deficits occurred. No subject in either arm showed improvement of greater than 7 points in LBOS or greater than 1 standard deviation in the specified domains of the SF-36. Mean ODI was 41.42 at baseline and 39.77 at 6 months for the IDET group, compared with 40.74 at baseline and 41.58 at 6 months for the placebo group. There was no significant change in ZDI or MSPQ scores for either group.The IDET procedure appeared safe with no permanent complications. No subject in either arm met criteria for successful outcome. Further detailed analyses showed no significant change in outcome measures in either group at 6 months. This study demonstrates no significant benefit from IDET over placebo.",1

Authors of the present study prospectively evaluated the effects of VCM in patients undergoing thoracic and/or lumbar fusion. METHODS In this randomized double-blind trial, 230 patients undergoing thoracic and/or lumbar fusion were randomly assigned to the local administration of VCM (interventional group, 1 g) or ampicillin (AMP; control group, 1 g) into the surgical field. The primary outcome was SSI results within 1 year of surgery. RESULTS The trial was prematurely stopped according to predetermined rules. The results showed one superficial infection (0.9%, Staphylococcus aureus ) and one deep infection (0.9%, S. aureus ) in the VCM group and two superficial infections (1.8%, Staphylococcus epidermidis and culture negative) and one deep infection (0.9%, methicillin-resistant S. aureus ) in the AMP group. No significant differences in infection rates were observed between the groups (p = 0.8). CONCLUSIONS This double-blind randomized controlled trial demonstrated that the local application of VCM or AMP powder into the operative field in short thoracic and/or lumbar fusion procedures resulted in a similar incidence of SSI. ■ CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE Type of question: therapeutic; study design: randomized controlled trial; evidence: class III.

A randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial in multimodal analgesia for postoperative pain was conducted. Objective. To examine whether combination of corticosteroid and bupivacaine administered in patients undergoing posterior lumbosacral spine surgery reduces postoperative morphine consumption, back and leg pain relief, and improves functional disability and general health status. Summary of Background Data. Patients with lumbar spine surgery had moderate to severe postoperative pain. Administration of corticosteroid or injection of local anesthetic agent has been additive treatment methods for opioid drugs. There is uncertainty as to whether corticosteroid and bupivacaine combination improves outcomes in lumbosacral spine surgery. Methods. A total of 103 patients who were scheduled to undergo elective posterior lumbar discectomy, decompressive laminectomy with or without instrumented fusion for degenerative spinal diseases, received either methylprednisolone locally applied to the affected nerve roots (and bupivacaine was infiltrated into the wound) or injected placebo. Morphine consumption and pain scores were recorded at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. Oswestry Index and Short Form SF-36 scores were recorded before surgery and at 1 and 3 months later. Results. Demographic data between the 2 groups were comparable. The cumulative morphine dose and postoperative pain was significantly lower in the study group than in the placebo group (P = 0.01 and P = 0.001, respectively). When performing subgroup analyses, the beneficial effects were found in all groups of surgery but could not demonstrated statistically significant difference for all subgroup comparisons. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with regard to pain on cough, Oswestry Index, and SF-36 scores. No complications were associated with the perioperative use of methylprednisolone or bupivacaine. Conclusions. Administration of methylprednisolone-bupivacaine provided a favorable effect immediately after posterior lumbosacral spine surgery for discectomy, decompression, and/or spinal fusion without complication.",1

A monocentric open-label randomized controlled trial (MRCT). Objective. Comparison of clinical and radiological outcomes between isolated instrumented posterior fusion (PLF) and associated instrumented posterior fusion and interbody fusion by transforaminal approach (PLF + TLIF) for patients suffering from one-level lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) undergoing surgery. Summary of Background Data. DS is a common cause of symptomatic lumbar stenosis. PLF has shown better clinical outcome than decompression with noninstrumented posterolateral fusion. TLIF with interbody cage showed better fusion rate than PLF. There is a need for randomized controlled trials to compare PLF with and without TLIF as to clinical and radiological outcomes. Methods. This is a MRCT comparing PLF and TLIF techniques in surgical treatment of DS. Sixty patients were included in a secured database from 2009 to 2011 and randomized into two groups: 30 PLF with posterior pedicle screws and intertransverse autologuous graft, and 30 TLIF in which an interbody fusion by transforaminal approach was added. Data included clinical (pain and disability), surgical (blood loss and operating time), and radiological (alignment and fusion) parameters at baseline and 2-year follow-up. Comparison was made by Student t test and Chi-square test. Results. There was a significant improvement in each group for pain and disability but no difference between the groups. Radiographic assessment showed better posterolateral fusion rate for TLIF without superiority in segmental lordosis improvement. A case of deformity cascade with spino-pelvic mismatch at baseline was noted in PLF. Conclusion. Posterior decompression and instrumented fusion is an efficient technique that proved its significant clinical benefit in the surgical treatment of DS. TLIF did not show its superiority neither in clinical nor alignment parameters despite a better fusion rate. These results suggest that TLIF is not mandatory in this specific indication. Sagittal alignment analysis by standing full-body images should be considered in DS care. Conclusion. Level of Evidence: 2",1

Chronic cases often require surgery, which may lead to biomechanical problems and accelerated degeneration of the adjacent segments. Autologous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) treatments have shown feasibility, safety and strong indications of clinical efficacy. We present here a randomized, controlled trial using allogeneic MSC, which are logistically more convenient than autologous cells.We randomized 24 patients with chronic back pain diagnosed with lumbar disk degeneration and unresponsive to conservative treatments into 2 groups. The test group received allogeneic bone marrow MSCs by intradiscal injection of 25 × 10 cells per segment under local anesthesia. The control group received a sham infiltration of paravertebral musculature with the anesthetic. Clinical outcomes were followed up for 1 year and included evaluation of pain, disability, and quality of life. Disc quality was followed up by magnetic resonance imaging.Feasibility and safety were confirmed and indications of clinical efficacy were identified. MSC-treated patients displayed a quick and significant improvement in algofunctional indices versus the controls. This improvement seemed restricted to a group of responders that included 40% of the cohort. Degeneration, quantified by Pfirrmann grading, improved in the MSC-treated patients and worsened in the controls.Allogeneic MSC therapy may be a valid alternative for the treatment of degenerative disc disease that is more logistically convenient than the autologous MSC treatment. The intervention is simple, does not require surgery, provides pain relief, and significantly improves disc quality.",1

We conducted a clinical controlled trial to investigate the effect and outcomes of this technique in such patients.Forty-three patients over 65 years old with thoracolumbar burst fractures without nerve injuries were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to treatment with simple PKP (control group, n = 22) or percutaneous short-segment pedicle screw internal fixation with PKP (treatment group, n = 21). The patients were followed for at least 2 years postoperatively and were assessed with regard to clinical and radiological outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly with use of visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire. Radiological outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of Cobb kyphosis angle and loss of kyphosis correction.There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to preoperative indices. The treatment group had better VAS scores and greater postoperative improvement on the ODI compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Postoperative kyphosis angle correction in the treatment group was superior to that in the control group, and loss of correction postoperatively was significantly less (P < 0.05). In the control group, two patients suffered refractures of the injured vertebra postoperatively and one had a fracture in the adjacent vertebra. No postoperative complications needing management were noted in either group.Compared with simple PKP, percutaneous internal fixation with PKP is a valuable surgical option for the treatment of selected elderly patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.",1

METHODS: Patients were randomized to undergo either percutaneous ( n = 31) or paraspinal ( n = 30) fluoroscopically-guided pedicle screw—rod fixation, and were followed for ≥ 3 years. Preoperative postural reduction was attempted in all patients. RESULTS: The percutaneous approach was associated with significantly less intraoperative blood loss and shorter duration of surgery and hospitalization, as well as less pain and better functional recovery at 3 months after surgery compared with the paraspinal approach. Paraspinal surgery resulted in significantly better correction of kyphosis and restoration of vertebral height compared with percutaneous surgery. There were no differences in long-term clinical outcomes between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive percutaneous approach appears to be better in cases of successful postural reduction. The paraspinal approach results in better surgical correction and is, therefore, recommended for patients without successful postural reduction.",1

Epidural steroids are commonly utilized in patients after the failure of conservative treatment. The results of epidural steroid injections have been variable based on the pathophysiology, the route of administration, injected drugs, and utilization of fluoroscopy. In patients resistant to fluoroscopically directed epidural injections, percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis and percutaneous targeted delivery of injections with or without adhesiolysis has been recommended. Percutaneous adhesiolysis has been studied in chronic pain syndromes related to post laminectomy syndrome and spinal stenosis with encouraging results. There is a paucity of literature regarding the effectiveness of the targeted delivery of medications with or without epidural adhesiolysis in patients recalcitrant to epidural steroid injections without a history of surgery and spinal stenosis. Study Design: A randomized, equivalence trial of percutaneous lumbar adhesiolysis and caudal epidural steroid injections in patients with low back and/or lower extremity pain without post surgery syndrome or spinal stenosis. Setting: An interventional pain management practice setting in the United States. Objective: The study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis in managing chronic low back and/or lower extremity pain in patients without post lumbar surgery syndrome or spinal stenosis and compare it with fluoroscopically directed caudal epidural steroid injections Methods: The study design includes 120 patients randomly assigned into 2 groups. Group I (60 patients), the control group, will receive caudal epidural injections with catheterization up to S3 with local anesthetic, steroids, and 0.9% sodium chloride solution; Group II (60 patients), the intervention group, will receive percutaneous adhesiolysis with target delivery of lidocaine, 10% hypertonic sodium chloride solution, and non-participate betamethasone. Randomization will be performed by computer-generated random allocation sequence by simple randomization. Outcome Measures: Multiple outcome measures will be utilized including numeric rating scale (NRS), the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI), employment status, and opioid intake with assessment at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post treatment. Significant pain relief is considered as 50% or more, whereas significant improvement in the disability score is defined as a reduction of 40% or more. Results: The results will be analyzed to show significant relief as well as improvement in functional status. Limitations: This study is limited by potentially inadequate double blinding and the lack of a placebo group.Conclusion: This protocol describes a comparative effectiveness evaluation of percutaneous adhesiolysis and epidural steroid injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain in patients without post surgery syndrome or spinal stenosis utilizing a randomized, equivalence trial design.

However, no randomized controlled studies have compared the efficacy of the two approaches--the Wiltse's paraspinal approach and open book laminectomy in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures with greenstick lamina fractures.Patients with burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine without neurological deficit were randomized to receive either the Wiltse's paraspinal approach (group A, 24 patients) or open book laminectomy (group B, 23 patients). Patients were followed postoperatively for average of 27.4 months. Clinical and radiographic data of the two approaches were collected and compared.Our results showed the anterior segmental height, kyphotic angle, visual analog scale (VAS) score, and Smiley-Webster Scale (SWS) score significantly improved postoperatively in both groups, indicating that both the Wiltse's paraspinal approach and open book laminectomy can effectively treat thoracolumbar burst fractures with greenstick lamina fractures. The Wiltse's paraspinal approach was found to have significantly shorter operating time, less blood loss, and shorter length of hospital stay compared to open book laminectomy. However, there were two (2/24) patients in group A that had neurological deficits postoperatively and required a second exploratory operation. Dural tears and/or cauda equina entrapment were subsequently found in four patients in group B and all two patients of neurological deficits in group A during operation. No screw loosening, plate breakage, or other internal fixation failures were found at final follow-up.The results demonstrated that either of the two surgical approaches can achieve satisfactory results in treating thoracolumbar burst fractures in patients with greenstick lamina fractures. However, if there is any clinical or radiographic suspicion of a dural tear and/or cauda equina entrapment pre-operation, patients should receive an open book laminectomy to avoid a second exploratory operation. More research is still needed to optimize clinical decision-making regarding surgical approach.",1

This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) versus optimal medical therapy (OMT) in controlling pain and improving the quality of life (QOL) in patients with VCFs. Efficacy was measured as the incidence of new vertebral fractures after PV, restoration of vertebral body height (VBH), and correction of deformity. Methods Of 105 patients with acute osteoporotic VCFs, 82 were eligible for participation: 40 patients underwent PV and 42 received OMT. Primary outcomes were control of pain and improvement in QOL before treatment, and these were measured at 1 week and at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after the beginning of the treatment. Radiological evaluation to measure VBH and sagittal index was performed before and after treatment in both groups and after 36 months of follow-up. Results The authors found a statistically significant improvement in pain in the PV group compared with the OMT group at 1 week (difference −3.1, 95% CI −3.72 to −2.28; p &lt; 0.001). The QOL improved significantly in the PV group (difference −14, 95% CI −15 to −12.82; p &lt; 0.028). One week after PV, the average VBH restoration was 8 mm and the correction of deformity was 8°. The incidence of new fractures in the OMT group (13.3%) was higher than in the PV group (2.2%; p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions The PV group had statistically significant improvements in visual analog scale and QOL scores maintained over 24 months, improved VBH maintained over 36 months, and fewer adjacent-level fractures compared with the OMT group.",1

However, controversy exists as to whether PV increases the risk for new VCFs during follow-up. The purpose of our research was to assess the incidence of new VCFs in patients with acute VCFs randomized to PV and conservative therapy.VERTOS II is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing PV with conservative therapy in 202 patients. Incidence, distribution, and timing of new VCFs during follow-up were assessed from spine radiographs. In addition, further height loss during follow-up of treated VCFs was measured.After a mean follow-up of 11.4 months (median, 12.0; range, 1-24 months), 18 new VCFs occurred in 15 of 91 patients after PV and 30 new VCFs in 21 of 85 patients after conservative therapy. This difference was not significant (P = .44). There was no higher fracture risk for adjacent-versus-distant vertebrae. Mean time to new VCF was 16.2 months after PV and 17.8 months after conservative treatment (logrank, P = .45). The baseline number of VCFs was the only risk factor for occurrence (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.95) and number (P = .01) of new VCFs. After conservative therapy, further height loss of treated vertebrae occurred more frequently (35 of 85 versus 11 of 91 patients, P < .001) and was more severe (P < .001) than after PV.Incidence of new VCFs was not different after PV compared with conservative therapy after a mean of 11.4 months' follow-up. The only risk factor for new VCFs was the number of VCFs at baseline. PV contributed to preservation of stature by decreasing both the incidence and severity of further height loss in treated vertebrae.",1

However, its safety when used after lumbar interbody fusion surgery remains unclear. We sought to determine whether ZOL infusion 3 days after transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) affects the risk of nonunion. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving subjects who underwent TLIF surgery. Eighty-two subjects (?50 years of age) were randomly assigned to receive either 5 mg intravenous ZOL (N=41) or placebo (N=41) 3 days after surgery. Each patient received a lumbar computed tomography scan 6 months and 12 months postoperatively. We evaluated interbody fusion using the multiplanar reconstruction technique. Clinical outcome was evaluated with the Oswestry Disability Index. Bone turnover markers (amino terminal propeptides of type I collagen and C-telopeptide of type I collagen) were measured to investigate the biological effects of ZOL on spinal fusion. RESULTS: In the ZOL group, 7 levels (11.5%) exhibited non-union; in the placebo group, 9 levels (14.5%) exhibited nonunion at 12 months postoperatively. This difference was not statistically significant (P=0.82). The difference in ODI scores between two groups was not statistically significant at any of the follow-up times. However, ZOL decreased bone turnover markers significantly. CONCLUSIONS: There was no association between ZOL treatment and nonunion of the lumbar spinal bone. Thus, undergoing lumbar interbody fusion surgery is not a valid reason to suspend or avoid treatment with ZOL.",1

The purpose of this prospective randomized controlled study was to elucidate the clinical and radiographic efficacies of LSO treatment in patients who underwent posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) of less than 3 segments.Seventy-three patients who underwent PLIF were randomly allocated to 3 groups: 1 with custom-made LSO with metallic stays (C group); 1 with ready-made LSO without metallic stays (R group), and 1 without LSO (N group). The patients in the C and R groups were instructed to wear LSO postoperatively for 3 months. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, JOA-back pain evaluation questionnaire (JOABPEQ), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, and 100-mm visual analog scale for low back pain. Radiographic evaluation included intervertebral fusion rates and loss of correction postoperatively at 2 years.A significant difference in the clinical outcomes was observed only for the lumbar dysfunction domain of JOABPEQ postoperatively at 1 month (N vs C groups; 45% vs 10%, P = .03). Radiographic outcomes were not different between the groups.No effect of orthosis treatment for less than 3 segments in PLIF was observed on clinical and radiographic outcomes. The type of orthosis also did not influence the outcomes. These results suggest that the use of LSO for PLIF can be simplified or is omissible except in patients with severe osteoporosis.",1

The spinal fusion rate was assessed at 6 and 12 months after surgery.The spinal fusion rate and the area of fusion, subsidence of each CaO-SiO2-P2O5-B2O3 glass ceramics and titanium cage, and the extent of osteolysis were evaluated using a dynamic plain radiography and a three-dimensional computed tomography at 12 months after surgery. The present study was supported by BioAlpha, and some authors (JHL, C-KL, and B-SC) have stock ownership (<10,000 US dollars).From the plain radiography results, the 6-month fusion rates for the bioactive glass ceramics group and the titanium group were 89.7% and 91.4%, respectively. In addition, the 12-month fusion rates based on CT scan were 89.7% and 91.2%, respectively, showing no significant difference. However, the bone fusion area directly attached to the end plate of either bioactive glass ceramics or the titanium cage was significantly higher in the bioactive glass ceramics group than in the titanium group. The ODI, SF-36, back pain, and lower limb pain in both groups significantly improved after surgery, with no significant differences between the groups. No significant differences between the two groups were observed in the extent of subsidence and osteolysis.In lumbar posterior interbody fusion surgery, CaO-SiO2-P2O5-B2O3 glass ceramics spacer showed a similar fusion rates and clinical outcomes compared with titanium cage.",1

Although their use after lumbar arthrodesis for degenerative conditions has been reported, there is a lack of evidence on which to base guidelines on their use. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a postoperative corset on the outcome of lumbar arthrodesis.A prospective randomized trial was performed in which patients who wore a postoperative lumbar corset for eight weeks full-time after a posterior lumbar arthrodesis for a degenerative spinal condition were compared with those who did not use a corset after such an operation. Ninety patients were randomized to one of the two treatments. A history was recorded and patients were assessed with a physical examination, radiographs, and functional outcome questionnaires (the Dallas Pain Questionnaire [DPQ] and the Short Form-36 [SF-36]) preoperatively and at one year and two years following the surgery. The primary outcome measure of the study was the DPQ, a disease-specific patient-derived functional measure of the spine, and secondary end points included the SF-36 scores, complications, rates of fusion as determined radiographically, and reoperation rates.Follow-up analysis was performed for seventy-two patients, thirty-seven randomized to the brace (experimental) group and thirty-five randomized to the control group. Regardless of the treatment method, the patients had substantial improvement in the disease-specific and general health measures by two years postoperatively. At two years, there was no difference in the DPQ category scores (the primary outcome parameter) of the two treatment groups. There was also no difference in the mean SF-36 component scores at two years. Postoperative complications occurred in 22% and 23% of patients in the experimental and control groups, respectively, and a subsequent lumbar spinal operation was performed in 19% and 14%, respectively. Seven patients (five in the experimental group and two in the control group) with radiographic evidence of nonunion underwent revision surgery.This study does not indicate a significant advantage or disadvantage to the use of a postoperative lumbar corset following spinal arthrodesis for degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine.Therapeutic Level I.

In this study, the authors analyzed the clinical outcomes of patients enrolled in the CHARITÉ investigational device exemption (IDE) trial who underwent revision surgery after primary total disc replacement with CHARITÉ or an anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) with placement of a BAK cage and iliac crest autograft. This revision surgery was either a supplemental posterior lumbar fixation or a 360° fusion. Statistical analysis was conducted to compare clinical success in patients who underwent revision surgery with those who did not. Methods The patients enrolled in the CHARITÉ IDE study were divided into 6 groups according to treatment and repeated operation status, and their Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores at the 2-year follow-up and at baseline were compared. The patients had received the following treatments by group: A) ALIF without reoperation; B) ALIF with conversion to 360° fusion; C) arthroplasty (randomized) without repeated operation; D) arthroplasty with supplemental posterior lumbar fixation; E) arthroplasty (nonrandomized) without repeated operation; and F) arthroplasty (nonrandomized) with supplemental posterior lumbar fixation. Outcome scores in the groups of patients who required revision surgeries (Groups B, D, and F; 23 patients) were compared with the groups that did not require revision surgery (Groups A, C, and E; 299 patients). Results Patients who required revision surgery had a significantly lower level of clinical improvement than those who did not. The mean change in ODI score was −53.0% in Groups A, C, and E, but just −12.7% in Groups B, D, and F (p &lt; 0.0001). The mean change in VAS score was −59.1% in Groups A, C, and E, compared to −23.4% in Groups B, D, and F (p &lt; 0.0001). No significant differences were identified in analyzing absolute change in scores and the percentage change. A comparison of outcomes in patients who had undergone arthroplasty without reoperation (Groups C and E) with all patients who had undergone revision surgery (Groups B, D, and F) demonstrated similar results (p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions The 7.1% of patients who underwent a secondary stabilization procedure had poor clinical improvement. This finding may indicate that if the alternative treatment had been the initial treatment, these patients would not have benefited, and further implies a 7.1% rate of imprecision in preoperative evaluation.",1

Our biomechanical study showed that it is feasible to accomplish posterior lumbar interbody fusion using posterolateral insertion of a single threaded cage with unilateral facetectomy and hemilaminectomy.Patients with a primary diagnosis of L4-L5 degenerative spondylolisthesis accompanied by low back pain and unilateral leg pain, having failed conservative treatment, were considered for the procedure. Twenty-five patients were randomized into two groups of 13 and 12, respectively, using a random number table. Group 1 had a single BAK fusion cage inserted posterolaterally and oriented counter anterolaterally on the symptomatic side with unilateral facetectomy and hemilaminectomy. Group 2 had two BAK fusion cages inserted posteriorly with bilateral facetectomy and laminectomy.A total of 12 of 13 patients in Group 1 and 11 of 12 patients in Group 2 achieved successful radiographic arthrodesis. Clinical results at 2 years for 7 of 13 patients in Group 1 were excellent, 4 of 13 were good, 2 of 13 fair, and no poor clinical results; 4 of 12 patients in Group 2 were excellent, 5 of 12 good, 1 of 12 fair, and 2 of 12 poor. Regarding complications, 2 of 12 in Group 2 had a postoperative motor and sensory deficit of the opposite adjacent (upper) nerve root.Posterior lumbar interbody fusion using diagonal insertion of a single threaded cage by a posterior approach with unilateral facetectomy enables sufficient decompression and solid interbody arthrodesis to be achieved while maintaining a majority of the posterior elements. It is a clinically safe, easy, and economic technique to treat lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis.",1

Two patients who had a two-level arthrodesis (L4-L5 and L5-S1) were excluded. Patients completed the Oswestry Disability Index, the Short Form-36, and the visual analog scale preoperatively and postoperatively at three, six, twelve, and twenty-four months. Computed tomography scans with coronal and sagittal reconstructions were made at three, six, and twelve months postoperatively. Interbody arthrodesis was performed using polyetheretherketone cages, which were filled with 8 mg of rhBMP-2 in the study group and 2.5 mL of autologous bone in the control group.Baseline demographic data showed no significant difference between groups, except for the body mass index, which was higher in the study group (p = 0.032). There were no significant differences in the clinical results (visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Short Form-36) between the groups at each postoperative visit. At three months, end-plate resorption was noted around the cages filled with rhBMP-2 in all patients in the study group. No cage migration or subsidence was observed. Bridging trabecular bone scale scores and bone density measures were significantly lower in the study group. Osteolysis and ectopic bone formation occurred in seven of nineteen patients in the study group and did not occur in the control group. This did not result in radicular symptoms within the time span of this study. At one year, computed tomography scans showed osseous healing in all patients. There were no revision procedures.This trial showed no clinical difference when rhBMP-2 was used in posterior lumbar interbody arthrodesis compared with autologous bone. On computed tomography scans, fusion was equally achieved, but trabecular bone formation occurred at a slower rate and interbody bone density was lower within the first year after surgery when rhBMP-2 was used. End-plate resorption, osteolysis, and ectopic bone formation were frequently noted in the rhBMP-2 group.",1

Patients' demographics were documented and follow-up visits were conducted after 6 weeks and then stepwise after 6 up to 36 months. Each follow-up visit included assessment of quality of life and pain using specific questionnaires (Core Outcome Measurements Index, Short-Form 36, and Oswestry Disability Index) as well as radiologic evaluation with the focus on the adjacent level alteration.Fifteen patients per group met the inclusion criteria, and after 36 months, the loss to follow-up was 20%. At the maximum follow-up time, the overall risk for adjacent segment degeneration was substantial (i.e., 24.14%), independent of the surgical procedure. Material failure was observed in 17.24%.

The primary goal of the VANCO Study is to compare the proportion of deep SSI 6 months after fracture fixation surgery. A secondary objective is to compare species and antibacterial susceptibilities among study patients who develop SSI. An additional objective is to build and validate a risk prediction model for the development of SSI. The study population consists of patients aged 18-80 years with tibial plateau or pilon (tibial plafond) fractures, at higher risk of infection, and definitively treated with plate and screw fixation. Participants are block randomized (within center) in a 1:1 ratio to either treatment group (local vancomycin powder up to a maximum dose of 1000 mg, placed immediately before wound closure) or control group (standard of care) for each study injury location, and return to the clinic for evaluations at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after fixation.

The impact of intrawound vancomycin has not been strongly postulated to decrease the risk of surgical site infection. We designed study to determine whether intrawound vancomycin application reduces the risk of SSI in patients after spine surgery. METHODS: A prospective randomized control trial study to evaluate the patients with elective spine surgery in a period of 15 month was designed. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether intrawound vancomycin was applied or not. The relative risk of SSI within postoperative 30 days was evaluated. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty patients were included in this study: degenerative spine pathologies and tumor 80% (304), trauma 11% (42) and deformity 9% (34). Intrawound vancomycin was used in 51% of patients. Prevalence of SSI was 2.7% in the absence of vancomycin use versus 5.2% with intrawound vancomycin. In multivariable regression model, those with higher number of levels exposed, postoperative ICU admission and obesity and use of instrumentation more than two levels had higher risk of developing SSI. In the treatment group Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%) were the most common pathogens. In control group, Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter (40%) were the most common organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Intrawound application of vancomycin after elective spine surgery was not associated with reduced risk of SSI and return to OR associated with SSI in our patients. However, the use of intrawound vancomycin changed the responsible infection germ.",1

In cross-sectional area analyses, increased atrophy of the multifidus muscle (MF) after conventional open versus minimally invasive posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) has been described. The three-dimensional characteristics of the paravertebral muscles and separate evaluation of the longissimus muscle (LS) have not been addressed in analyses thus far.The purpose of the present study was to compare the MF and LS volume atrophy and fatty degeneration between single-level minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (miTLIF) and conventional midline approach-based PLIF (coPLIF) of L4/L5 or L5/S1 at the index and superior adjacent segments.This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, non-blinded study.Fifty patients with single-level segment degeneration (Pfirrmann ≥III and Modic ≥3) of L4/L5 or L5/S1 not requiring decompression were randomly assigned to two groups.Paraspinal lumbar residual muscle tissue volume, change in the relative fat content of MF and LS at the index and superior adjacent segments, and clinical parameters, including a visual analogue scale (VAS) for low back pain and the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODI) were the outcome measures in this study.Twenty-five patients were treated with miTLIF, and the remaining patients were treated with coPLIF (both with transpedicular fixation). Clinical scoring was performed preoperatively and at 1 week and 12 months postoperatively, and computed tomography was performed at the latter two follow-ups.The LS damage at the index segment was similar in both groups (3% greater fat content increase in the coPLIF vs. the miTLIF group, p=.032), whereas MF atrophy and degeneration were increased (p<.001) in the coPLIF group. At the adjacent segment, muscle atrophy and increased fatty infiltration (p<.05) were minimal in both muscles but were similar in both groups. Visual analogue scale and ODI scores improved (p<.001), without differences between the groups.The muscle damage after miTLIF was inferior to that after coPLIF; spatially, however, the muscle sparing was predominantly attributed to the MF and, surprisingly, not to the LS.",1

There is some evidence for the use of minimally invasive surgery for degenerative lumbar spine stenosis (LSS), but there are currently no studies comparing outcomes with matched controls. The object of this study was to compare outcomes following minimally invasive unilateral laminectomy for bilateral decompression (ULBD) to a standard “open” laminectomy for LSS. Methods The authors conducted a prospective, 1:1 randomized trial comparing ULBD to open laminectomy for degenerative LSS. The study enrolled 79 patients between 2007 and 2009, and adequate data for analysis were available in 54 patients (27 in each arm of the study). Patient demographic characteristics and clinical characteristics were recorded and clinical outcomes were obtained using pre- and postoperative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, visual analog scale (VAS) scores for leg pain, patient satisfaction index scores, and postoperative 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) scores. Results Significant improvements were observed in ODI and VAS scores for both open and ULBD interventions (p &lt; 0.001 for both groups using either score). In addition, the ULBD-treated patients had a significantly better mean improvement in the VAS scores (p = 0.013) but not the ODI scores (p = 0.055) compared with patients in the open-surgery group. ULBD-treated patients had a significantly shorter length of postoperative hospital stay (55.1 vs 100.8 hours, p = 0.0041) and time to mobilization (15.6 vs 33.3 hours, p &lt; 0.001) and were more likely to not use opioids for postoperative pain (51.9% vs 15.4%, p = 0.046). Conclusions Based on short-term follow-up, microscopic ULBD is as effective as open decompression in improving function (ODI score), with the additional benefits of a significantly greater decrease in pain (VAS score), postoperative recovery time, time to mobilization, and opioid use.",1

Patients were randomly allocated to the Surgiflo Haemostatic Matrix (SHM) group or the AGS group (AGS) by computer-generated randomization codes. The success rates of hemostasis for 3 minutes and 5 minutes, the time of operation, the amount of intraoperative bleeding, the volume of autogenously blood transfusion, the amount of blood during hemostasis, the amount of blood transfusion, and BP, RBC, HCT, HB of preoperative, 2 to 3 days, and 5 to 7 days following operation were recorded to compare. Daily drainage and all adverse events after operation were also compared.All the patients were followed up for at least 1 month. The RBC and HCT of the AGS group before operation were lower than those in the control group (P = .039, P = .029), but there was no difference after operation (P >.05). In the control group, 19 cases were successfully hemostatic in 3 minutes, 4 cases were successful in 5 minutes, and 7 cases were combined with hemostasis. In the SHM group, it was 22, 3, and 5 cases respectively. There was significant difference in blood loss during hemostatic process between the 2 groups (P <.001). There was no difference in the amount of blood loss and autologous blood transfusion between the 2 groups, and there was no difference in the operation time between the 2 groups. In the AGS group, allogeneic blood was infused in 1 case during operation, and no allogeneic blood was infused in the other patients. The drainage volume on the 1st day and the 2nd to 4th day after operation in the AGS group was less than that in the control group (P = .015, P = .010).Compared with AGS, SHM could decrease the blood loss during hemostatic process and the postoperative drainage volume in posterior operation of lumbar degenerative disease. SHM is a safe and effective hemostatic agent in lumbar posterior surgery.",1

Objective Despite a large number of publications of outcomes after spinal fusion surgery, there is still no consensus on the efficacy of the several different fusion methods. The aim of this study was to determine whether transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) results in an improved clinical outcome compared with uninstrumented posterolateral fusion (PLF) in the surgical treatment for chronic low back pain. Methods This study included 135 patients with degenerative disk disease (n = 96) or postdiskectomy syndrome (n = 39). Inclusion criteria were at least 1 year of back pain with or without leg pain in patients aged 20 to 65 with one- or two-level disease. Exclusion criteria were sequestration of disk hernia, psychosocial instability, isthmic spondylolisthesis, drug abuse, and previous spine surgery other than diskectomy. Pain was assessed by visual analog scale (pain index). Functional disability was quantified by the disability rating index and Oswestry Disability Index. The global outcome was assessed by the patient and classified as much better, better, unchanged, or worse. The patients were randomized to conventional uninstrumented PLF (n = 67) or TLIF (n = 68). PLF was performed in a standardized fashion using autograft. TLIF was performed with pedicle titanium screw fixation and a porous tantalum interbody spacer with interbody and posterolateral autograft. The clinical outcome measurements were obtained preoperatively and at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. The 2-year follow-up rate was 98%. Results The two treatment groups improved significantly from preoperatively to 2 years' follow-up. At final follow-up, the results in the TLIF group were significantly superior to those in the PLF group in pain index (2.0 versus 3.9, p = 0.007) and in disability rating index (22 versus 36, p = 0.003). The Oswestry Disability Index was better in the TLIF group (20 versus 28, p = 0.110, not significant). The global assessment was clearly superior in the TLIF group: 63% of patients scored ""much better"" in the TLIF group as compared with 48% in the PLF group (p = 0.017). Conclusions The results of the current study support the use of TLIF rather than uninstrumented PLF in the surgical treatment of the degenerative lumbar spine. The less optimal outcome after uninstrumented PLF may be explained by the much higher reoperation rate.",1

A total of 94 patients were randomized into a surgical or nonoperative treatment group: 50 and 44 patients, respectively. Surgery comprised undercutting laminectomy of the stenotic segments in 10 patients augmented with transpedicular fusion. The primary outcome was based on assessment of functional disability using the Oswestry Disability Index (scale, 0-100). Data on the intensity of leg and back pain (scales, 0-10), as well as self-reported and measured walking ability were compiled at randomization and at follow-up examinations at 6, 12, and 24 months.Both treatment groups showed improvement during follow-up. At 1 year, the mean difference in favor of surgery was 11.3 in disability (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3-18.4), 1.7 in leg pain (95% CI, 0.4-3.0), and 2.3(95% CI, 1.1-3.6) in back pain. At the 2-year follow-up, the mean differences were slightly less: 7.8 in disability (95% CI, 0.8-14.9) 1.5 in leg pain (95% CI, 0.3-2.8), and 2.1 in back pain (95% CI, 1.0-3.3). Walking ability, either reported or measured, did not differ between the two treatment groups.Although patients improved over the 2-year follow-up regardless of initial treatment, those undergoing decompressive surgery reported greater improvement regarding leg pain, back pain, and overall disability. The relative benefit of initial surgical treatment diminished over time, but outcomes of surgery remained favorable at 2 years. Longer follow-up is needed to determine if these differences persist.",1

While no statistically significant between-group differences for new or progressed fracture risk at 12 and 24 months were observed, we observed a consistent trend towards higher risk of any type of fracture in the group undergoing VP. Our analysis was underpowered, and further adequately powered studies are needed to be able to draw firm conclusions about further vertebral risk with vertebroplasty.This study seeks to assess the effect of VP on the risk of further radiologically apparent vertebral fracture within two years of the procedure.We conducted a randomised placebo-controlled trial of VP in people with acute osteoporotic vertebral fracture. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to VP (n = 38) or placebo (n = 40). Cement volume and leakage were recorded for the VP group. Plain thoracolumbar radiographs were taken at baseline, 12 and 24 months. Two independent radiologists assessed these for new and progressed fractures at the same, adjacent and non-adjacent levels.At 12 and 24 months, radiographs were available for 45 (58 %) and 47 (60 %) participants, respectively. There were no between-group differences for new or progressed fractures: 32 and 40 in the VP group after 12 and 24 months compared with 21 and 33 in the placebo group (hazard ratio (HR) 1.80, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 3.94). Similar results were seen when considering only adjacent (HR (95 % CI) 2.30 (0.57 to 9.29)) and non-adjacent (HR (95 % CI) 1.45 (0.55 to 3.81) levels. In all comparisons, there was a consistent trend towards higher risk of any type of fracture in the group undergoing VP. Within the VP group, fracture risk was unrelated to total (HR (95 % CI) 0.91 (0.71 to 1.17)) or relative (HR (95 % CI) 1.31 (0.15 to 11.48)) cement volume or cement leakage (HR (95 % CI) 1.20 (0.63 to 2.31)).For patients undergoing VP, our study did not demonstrate significant increases in subsequent fracture risk beyond that experienced by those with vertebral fractures who did not undergo the procedure. However, because of the non-significant numerical increases observed, studies with adequate power are needed to draw definite conclusions about fracture risk.",1

The efficacy of preoperative or preemptive pain relief after thoracolumbosacral spine surgery has not been well studied. The present study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of preemptive analgesia with a single-shot epidural injection in adult patients undergoing spine surgery. METHODS Ninety-nine adult patients undergoing thoracolumbosacral operations via a posterior approach were randomized to receive a single shot of either epidural placebo (group 1), hydromorphone alone (group 2), or bupivacaine with hydromorphone (group 3) before surgery at the preoperative holding area. The primary outcome was the presence of opioid sparing and rescue time—defined as the time interval from when a patient was extubated to the time pain medication was first demanded during the postoperative period. Secondary outcomes include length of stay at the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), pain score at the PACU, opioid dose, and hospital length of stay. RESULTS Of the 99 patients, 32 were randomized to the epidural placebo group, 33 to the hydromorphone-alone group, and 34 to the bupivacaine with hydromorphone group. No significant difference was seen across the demographics and surgical complexities for all 3 groups. Compared to the control group, opioid sparing was significantly higher in group 2 (57.6% vs 15.6%, p = 0.0007) and group 3 (52.9% vs 15.6%, p = 0.0045) in the first demand of intravenous hydromorphone as a supplemental analgesic medication. Compared to placebo, the rescue time was significantly higher in group 2 (187 minutes vs 51.5 minutes, p = 0.0014) and group 3 (204.5 minutes vs 51. minutes, p = 0.0045). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The authors’ study demonstrated that preemptive analgesia in thoracolumbosacral surgeries can significantly reduce analgesia requirements in the immediate postoperative period as evidenced by reduced request for opioid medication in both analgesia study groups who received a preoperative analgesic epidural. Nonetheless, the lack of differences in pain score and opioid dose at the PACU brings into question the role of preemptive epidural opioids in spine surgery patients. Further work is necessary to investigate the long-term effectiveness of preemptive epidural opioids and their role in pain reduction and patient satisfaction.

It is uncertain if spinal fusion is also necessary.Following completion of a standardized physiotherapy program, 44 patients with single-level disc disease were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 surgical groups. In those patients undergoing instrumentation, segmental pedicle screw fixation was used to stabilize the spine. Titanium interbody cages filled with autologous bone were inserted into patients in Group 3. Spinal disability, quality of life, and pain were assessed before surgery, and then at 1, 2, and 5 years by an independent researcher.At 2 years, 82% of the patients were pain free or moderately improved. Disability (Low Back Outcome Score and Roland Morris index) were both better in Group 1, but only Low Back Outcome Score was better in Group 2 (P < 0.05). By 5 years, although patients in all 3 groups showed some improvements in all the ratings used (Low Back Outcome Score, SF-36 Physical Functioning, and Roland Morris score), only Group 1 patients showed significant changes in all 3 outcomes (P < 0.05). There was no difference in any score between groups (P > 0.05). Two had secondary surgery for adjacent level stenosis (Group 2 and 3). One patient (Group 1) underwent subsequent lateral mass fusion for chronic pain. No patient required revision surgery for instrumentation failure, cage displacement, or pseudarthrosis. Evidence of at least unilateral lateral mass bone graft incorporation was evident in 95% of Groups 2 and 3.The results are encouraging in that almost all patients had improved by 5 years. However, it is a concern that no significant additional benefit has been noted from the more complex surgery. This suggests that patients are optimally treated by decompression alone, with the proviso that further operations may be required.",1

The radiological outcome was assessed by acquiring radiographs in the standing position and computed tomographic scans. The clinical outcome was measured in terms of the American Spinal Injury Association score, visual analogue scale score, and Oswestry Disability Index. Moreover, we assessed the severity of overall morbidity and morbidity at the donor site in the 2 patient groups. The Student t and χ tests were used for the analysis of independent variables and categorical data, respectively.Only 57 of the enrolled patients were available for the required 24-month follow-up period, 27 underwent TTIF and 30 underwent P-A fusion. Both treatments were similar with respect to the fusion rate, extent of decompression, loss of correction, rate of instrumentation failure, American Spinal Injury Association score, visual analogue scale score, and Oswestry Disability Index (P > 0.05). However, the blood loss, operating time, and rate of perioperative complications were greater in the P-A group than in the TTIF group (P < 0.05).The clinical and radiological outcomes were similar for both the treatment procedures. However, our findings suggest that TTIF allows for safe interbody fusion and circumferential decompression, requires only a posterior approach, and is associated with a lower incidence of surgery-related complications.2.",1

We conducted a controlled clinical trial to define the effect of fusion on lumbar spine and patient-related functional outcomes.From 2000 to 2002, seventy-three consecutive patients with a single-level Denis type-B burst fracture involving the thoracolumbar spine and a load-sharing score of <or=6 were managed with posterior pedicle screw instrumentation. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment with posterolateral fusion (fusion group, n = 37) or without posterolateral fusion (nonfusion group, n = 36). The patients were followed for at least five years after surgery and were assessed with regard to clinical and radiographic outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with use of the Frankel scale, the motor score of the American Spinal Injury Association, a visual analog scale, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Radiographic outcomes were assessed on the basis of the local kyphosis angle and loss of kyphosis correction.No significant difference in radiographic or clinical outcomes was noted between the patients managed with the two techniques. Both operative time and blood loss were significantly less in the nonfusion group compared with the fusion group (p < 0.05). Twenty-five of the thirty-seven patients in the fusion group still had some degree of donor-site pain at the time of the latest examination.Posterolateral bone-grafting is not necessary when a Denis type-B thoracolumbar burst fracture associated with a load-sharing score of <or=6 is treated with short-segment pedicle screw fixation.",1

This study attempted to compare the feasibility and clinical outcomes of C1 pedicle with lateral mass screw fixations for treatment of AAI with C1 posterior arches >4 mm.A total of 140 patients with AAI (C1 posterior arches measuring >4 mm) was enrolled in this single-center, randomized, double-blind trial. The subjects were randomly assigned into two treatments: C1 pedicle (group A) or lateral mass (group B) screw fixation. The patients, independent evaluating physicians and radiologists were blinded throughout the entire study. Patients were assessed before operation and in a series of follow-ups at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years post-surgery. The operation time, volume of blood loss, intraoperative complications, bone fusion rates, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were monitored.All 140 patients showed overall improvements in clinical symptoms after surgery. The mean follow-up time was 24.5 ± 13.0 months. In both groups, the mean JOA scores improved significantly at the time of final follow-up as compared to prior surgery (group A: 7.1 ± 1.4 vs 13.7 ± 1.9; group B:7.3 ± 1.8 vs 13.1 ± 1.4; improvement rates: 87.2% (group A) and 86.5% (group B)). The VAS scores also decreased significantly in both groups at the time of final follow-up as compared to prior surgery (group A: 6.0 ± 1.3 vs 1.7 ± 0.8, and group B: 5.7 ± 1.1 vs 2.1 ± 1.2). Bone fusion was achieved within 12 months postoperatively in the patients from both groups. The operation time was significantly shorter and volume of blood loss was significantly less in the patients from group A as compared to group B (p < 0.01). Furthermore, thirteen patients had burst bleeding from the C1-2 venous plexus and nine patients had immediate pain and numbness in the occipitocervical region due to C2 nerve roots irritation during lateral mass screw replacement, which were not observed in the patients with C1 pedicle screw insertion. No complications such as screw loosening, shifting, breakage, or AAI were observed in both groups.C1 pedicle screw fixation is less invasive and simpler, and has fewer complications. It renders better clinical outcomes than lateral mass screw fixation for treatment of AAI.Current Controlled Trials ChiCTR-IOR-15006748 .",1

The accuracy of pedicle screws at L4 and L5 level were evaluated by three-dimensional postoperative computed tomography (CT). There was no apparent violation of pedicle or < 2 mm perforation of pedicle in non-violation group while ≥ 2 mm perforation of pedicle in violation group.A total of 188 patients were recruited and assigned randomly into navigation (n = 47) and control (n = 141) groups. Two groups did not differ in estimated blood loss volume, length of hospital stay, Japanese Orthopedics Association (JOA) score or JOA recovery rate (P > 0.05). Navigation group had a longer operative duration (P < 0.05). At L4 level, 93/94 screws (98.9%) in navigation group and 273/282 screws (96.8%) in control group did not violate pedicle (P > 0.05). At L5 level, 93/94 screws (98.9%) in navigation group and 260/282 screws (92.2%) in control group did not violate pedicle. Thus navigation could achieve a higher accuracy at L5 level (P < 0.05).The profile of L5 pedicle at coronal plane is tilting oval. Screw may easily violate medioinferior part of pedicle and cause injures of nerve root. For improving the accuracy and safety of pedicle screw at L5 level, we recommend using intraoperative three-dimensional navigation for spondylolisthesis or facet hypertrophy, iliac cohesion or junior operator.",1

Iso-C based navigation has been reported to improve the accuracy of pedicle screw placement, but its use in the presence of deformity has not been reported.Twenty-seven patients with scoliosis and 6 patients with kyphosis had a total of 478 thoracic pedicle screws. The average Cobb angle was 58.4 degrees +/- 8 degrees (range 50 degrees -80 degrees), and the mean kyphotic angle was 54.6 degrees +/- 4 degrees (range 51 degrees -76 degrees). By random allocation, 17 patients had screw insertion under navigation (242 screws) and 16 under fluoroscopic control (236 screws). The 2 groups were compared for accuracy of screw placement, time for screw insertion, and the number of times the C-arm had to be brought into the field. Two independent blinded observers determined accuracy using postoperative computed tomography assessments.There were 54 (23%) pedicle breaches in the non-navigation group as compared to only 5 (2%) in the navigation group (P < 0.001). Thirty-eight screws (16%) in the non-navigation group had penetrated the anterior or lateral cortex compared to 2 screws (0.8%) in the navigation group. Average screw insertion time in the non-navigation group was 4.61 +/- 1.05 minutes (range 1.8-6.5) compared to 2.37 +/- 0.72 minutes (range 1.16-4.5) in navigation group (P < 0.01). The C-arm had to be moved into the operation field on an average of 1.5 +/- 0.25 times (range 1-3) per screw. With single screening data, an average of 11.4 pedicles (range 9-14) could be visualized without necessity to bring the C-arm into operating field again.Iso-C navigation increases accuracy, and reduces surgical time and radiation in thoracic deformity correction surgeries.",1

The minimally invasive technique of transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS TLIF) is increasingly used but has been found to generate increased radiation exposure to the patient and staff. Modern three-dimensional (3D) C-arm devices are capable of providing conventional two-dimensional fluoroscopic images (x-rays) as well as 3D image sets for intraoperative navigation. This study was designed to compare the radiation exposure between these two intraoperative imaging techniques in MIS TLIF procedures.This study is a randomized controlled trial. Forty participants scheduled to undergo monosegmental MIS TLIF will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of two groups with respect to the applied intraoperative imaging technique: conventional fluoroscopy (FLUORO group) and 3D fluoroscopy-based navigation combined with conventional fluoroscopy (NAV group). Furthermore, patients scheduled to undergo bisegmental MIS TLIF during the recruitment period for monosegmental MIS TLIF will be assessed for eligibility and will be randomly assigned separately. The primary endpoint is the radiation exposure to the surgeon and is measured by dosimeter readings. Secondary endpoints are the radiation exposure to the assistant surgeon, scrub nurse, anesthetist, patient, and C-arm as well as radiation exposure in relation to the body mass index of the patient.Results of this randomized study will help to compare the radiation exposure to the operating staff and patient during MIS TLIF procedures using conventional fluoroscopy versus 3D fluoroscopy-based navigation combined with conventional fluoroscopy. Furthermore, recommendations regarding the appropriate use of the investigated intraoperative imaging techniques will be made to improve radiation protection and to reduce radiation exposure.Registration number of the German Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00004514 .

However, no clinical data exist on whether this imaging modality negatively impacts patient outcomes. Thus, the goal of this randomized controlled trial was to assess pedicle screw placement accuracy with ULRI with image enhancement compared with conventional, standard-dose fluoroscopy for patients undergoing single-level MIS-TLIF. METHODS An institutional review board–approved, prospective internally randomized controlled trial was performed to compare breach rates for pedicle screw placement performed using ULRI with image enhancement versus conventional fluoroscopy. For cannulation and pedicle screw placement, surgery on 1 side (left vs right) was randomly assigned to be performed under ULRI. Screws on the opposite side were placed under conventional fluoroscopy, thereby allowing each patient to serve as his/her own control. In addition to standard intraoperative images to check screw placement, each patient underwent postoperative CT. Three experienced neurosurgeons independently analyzed the images and were blinded as to which imaging modality was used to assist with each screw placement. Screw placement was analyzed for pedicle breach (lateral vs medial and Grade 0 [&lt; 2.0 mm], Grade 1 [2.0–4.0 mm], or Grade 2 [&gt; 4.0 mm]), appropriate screw depth (50%–75% of the vertebral body’s anteroposterior dimension), and appropriate screw angle (within 10° of the pedicle angle). The effective breach rate was calculated as the percentage of screws evaluated as breached &gt; 2.0 mm medially or postoperatively symptomatic. RESULTS Twenty-three consecutive patients underwent single-level MIS-TLIF, and their sides were randomly assigned to receive ULRI. No patient had immediate postoperative complications (e.g., neurological decline, need for hardware repositioning). On CT confirmation, 4 screws that had K-wire placement and cannulation under ULRI and screw placement under conventional fluoroscopy showed deviations. There were 2 breaches that deviated medially but both were Grade 0 (&lt; 2.0 mm). Similarly, 2 breaches occurred that were Grade 1 (&gt; 2.0 mm) but both deviated laterally. Therefore, the effective breach rate (breach &gt; 2.0 mm deviated medially) was unchanged in both imaging groups (0% using either ULRI or conventional fluoroscopy; p = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS ULRI with image enhancement does not compromise accuracy during pedicle screw placement compared with conventional fluoroscopy while it significantly decreases radiation exposure to both the patient and operating room personnel.",1

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Although the benefits of MIS are lauded by many, there is a significant amount of radiation exposure to surgeon and operating room personnel. Our goal with this work was to see if by using ultra-low dose radiation settings coupled with image enhancement, this exposure could be minimized. METHODS An institutional review board approved, prospective, internally randomized controlled trial was performed comparing ultra-low dose settings coupled with image enhancement software to conventional fluoroscopic imaging. In this study, each patient served as their own control, randomly assigning one side of MIS-TLIF for cannulation and K-wire placement using each imaging modality. Further, the case was also randomly divided into screw placement and cage placement/final images to allow further comparisons amongst patients. Radiation production from the C-arm fluoroscope and radiation exposure to all operating room personnel were recorded. RESULTS Twenty-four patients were randomly assigned to undergo a single level MIS-TLIF. In no case was low radiation imaging abandoned, and no patient had a neurologic decline or required hardware repositioning. Everyone in the operating room-the physician, scrub nurse, circulator, and anesthesiologist-all benefited with 61.6% to 83.5% reduction in radiation exposure during cannulation and K-wire placement to screw insertion aided by ULRI. In every case but the anesthesiologist dose, this was statistically significant (P < 0.05). This benefit required no additional time (P = 0.78 for K-wire placement). CONCLUSION ULRI, when aided by image enhancement software, affords the ability for all parties in the operating room to substantially decrease their radiation exposure compared with standard-dose C-arm fluoroscopy without adding additional time or an increased complication rate.

OBJECTIVE To compare the impact of robotic guidance in a minimally invasive spine surgery (MIS) to a fluoroscopy-guided open approach in lumbar fusions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA MIS requires a protracted learning curve and excessively exposes the patient and surgical team to harmful radiation. Robotic-guidance has been shown to improve accuracy and radiation in most studies, but there is conflicting prospective data. METHODS Patients indicated to undergo a 1 or 2 level spinal fusion were randomized between robotic-guided MIS (RO) and fluoroscopic-guided open surgery (FA). Patient demographics and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS Thirty patients were recruited to each arm. Average age was 66.7 years, 71.5% were females, and average body mass index was 25.2. Thirty-five levels were instrumented with 130 pedicle screws in RO versus 40 levels with 140 screws in FA, or 4.3 and 4.7 screws per surgery, respectively. Use of fluoroscopy was 3.5 versus 13.3 seconds in the RO and FA respectively (P  2 mm and >4 mm) in FA (P = 0.500). One proximal facet violation occurred in the study, it was in FA (P = 1.000). The average distance from the proximal facets was 5.8 versus 4.6 mm in the RO and FA respectively (P < 0.001). The average length of stay was 6.8 versus 9.4 days in RO compared with FA (P = 0.020). CONCLUSION MIS using robotic-guidance significantly reduced radiation exposure and length of stay. Patient outcomes were not affected by the surgical technique. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 1.",1

The patients were randomly divided into CAMISS group and traditional open treatment group (control group) by random number table. Clinical results were assessed by comparing the following parameters between patients who had undergone CAMISS or traditional open surgery: operative time, estimated blood loss, visual analogue scale (VAS) of the low back pain, the accuracy of pedicle screw, the status and the correction of kyphosis.Forty-seven patients underwent CAMISS, and fifty patients underwent traditional open surgery. The follow-up periods were 3 - 50 months (mean 12 months). According to the preoperative data, the two groups did not differ with respect to age, gender, marriage, occupation, mechanism of injury, classification of fracture, preoperative VAS scores of the low back pain, preoperative functional spine unit (FSU) Cobb's angle and preoperative local angle of the fracture vertebral body (P > 0.05). Compare to the control group, the patients who got CAMISS had more accuracy of pedicle screw, less blood loss, short immobilized time, lower postoperative fever, and better VAS score of the low back pain (t = 2.162 - 8.736, P < 0.05). The improvement of FSU Cobb's angle and local angle of the fracture vertebral body were better at control group after operation (13.8° ± 6.8° vs. 10.9° ± 5.5°, 11.0° ± 6.0° vs. 7.7° ± 4.8°, t = 2.108 and 2.610, P < 0.05). But there was no significant difference of the FSU Cobb's angle, or local angle of the fracture vertebral body between the two groups at post-operation and follow-up (P > 0.05).CAMISS has the characteristics of fewer traumas, less bleeding, faster recovery, high accuracy of pedicle screws. It has comparable vertebral deformity correction and fixation result of the traditional open operation.",1

The primary outcomes were the score on the Roland Disability Questionnaire, the score on the visual-analogue scale for leg pain, and the patient's report of perceived recovery during the first year after randomization. Repeated-measures analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle was used to estimate the outcome curves for both groups.Of 141 patients assigned to undergo early surgery, 125 (89%) underwent microdiskectomy after a mean of 2.2 weeks. Of 142 patients designated for conservative treatment, 55 (39%) were treated surgically after a mean of 18.7 weeks. There was no significant overall difference in disability scores during the first year (P=0.13). Relief of leg pain was faster for patients assigned to early surgery (P<0.001). Patients assigned to early surgery also reported a faster rate of perceived recovery (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.72 to 2.22; P<0.001). In both groups, however, the probability of perceived recovery after 1 year of follow-up was 95%.The 1-year outcomes were similar for patients assigned to early surgery and those assigned to conservative treatment with eventual surgery if needed, but the rates of pain relief and of perceived recovery were faster for those assigned to early surgery.

It is characterized, however, by a lack of osseointegration and limited biocompatibility. Consequently, CaP is currently being investigated as an alternative material for vertebral augmentation.Inclusion criteria were 1 or 2 adjacent osteoporotic fractures of vertebral bodies in the thoracolumbar spine, patient age > or =65 years, and fracture age < or =4 months. Exclusion criteria were tumor lesions and additional posterior instrumentation.A total of 60 osteoporotic vertebral body fractures in 56 patients were included. CaP and PMMA were randomly applied in 30 vertebrae each with 2-fracture-patients receiving only 1 type of cement for both vertebrae. All 60 fractures were classified compression fractures (type A). Of these, 27 were classified burst fractures (type A3). 52/56 patients experienced statistically significant pain relief (7.9 +/- 1.9 to 1.8 +/- 2.1 on a Visual Analog Scale from 0 ""best"" to 10 ""worst""). Bisegmental endplate angles were restored by 6.2 degrees +/- 5.9 degrees on average. Complications that turned out to be cement-specific were: vascular embolism (n = 2) for PMMA; subtotal cement washout (n = 1); and radiographic loss of correction (n = 9) due to cement failure in burst fractures for CaP. There was no case of cement failure, when PMMA had been used.The routine use of the CaP tested is not currently recommended for kyphoplasty. Because of its low resistance against flexural, tractive, and shear forces compared to PMMA, in certain constellations (burst fractures), there is a higher risk of cement failure and subsequent loss of correction.",1

The secondary study objective was to compare adjacent level fracture rates and vertebral body height for these 2 intervention methods.Cement leakage remains a significant clinical problem associated with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures. Uncontrolled cement flow in the posterior direction can result in leakage into the vertebral veins or spinal canal, leading to potentially serious clinical complications.Seventy-seven patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were enrolled. Patients were randomized 2:1 for treatment with CDKS (49 patients, 65 levels) or vertebroplasty (28 patients, 39 levels). Cement leakage was evaluated from radiographs and computed tomographic scans. Three- and 12-month follow-ups included additional radiographs and computed tomographic scans to assess changes in vertebral body height and the incidence of new fractures.Treatment with CDKS significantly reduced the number of levels with leaks and the total number of leaks per level, as compared with vertebroplasty (P = 0.0132 and P = 0.0012, respectively). Significantly, fewer lateral cortical and spinal canal leaks (posterior leaks) occurred in the CDKS group (P = 0.0050, P = 0.02260, respectively). Three adjacent level fractures occurred in the vertebroplasty group, as compared with 2 in the CDKS group. Vertebral body height maintenance was equivalent.Cement directed kyphoplasty effectively reduces posterior cement leakage, reducing the risk of leakage related complications.2.",1

Previous studies of joint arthroplasty have shown that use of the bipolar sealer reduces blood loss and tissue damage during the operation. However, it is unknown whether a bipolar sealer reduces blood loss and tissue damage in lumbar posterolateral fusion (PLF) surgery. The purpose of this study was to analyze the efficacy of this device in limiting blood loss during exposure of the lumbar spine in the treatment of PLF and postoperative pain. METHODS: Fifty patients who underwent PLF were prospectively enrolled between October 2011 and March 2013. Twenty-five patients were randomized to the bipolar sealer group (BS group) and 25 patients to the standard electrocautery group (control group). Operative time and blood loss during exposure of posterior bony elements including the transverse process for PLF, visual analog scale (VAS) to quantify postoperative pain, and the interval from the surgery to hospital discharge were compared. RESULTS: Operative time and blood loss expressed per level of exposure were significantly lower in the BS group than in the control group. There was a tendency toward a lower VAS at postoperative week 1 in the BS group. The duration of hospitalization was 15 and 26 days in the BS and control groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A large randomized control trial adjusted for the number of fusion levels and body mass index is required to confirm the novelty value of this new bipolar sealers.",1

However, there is a dearth of literature on prospective study of the efficacy of bipolar sealer device in reducing perioperative blood loss and transfusions in patients undergoing degenerative lumbar scoliosis surgery.A total of 100 consecutive degenerative lumbar scoliosis patients who had undergone primary decompression and posterior spinal fusion with segmental spinal instrumentation between June 2010 and June 2012 were prospectively randomized into 1 of 2 groups according to whether bipolar sealer device for intraoperative/postoperative blood management was used or not. Demographic distribution, perioperative blood loss, blood transfusion rate, the length of stay, and postoperative complications were analyzed.The operation time was significantly shorter in the study group than in the control group, 223.4 versus 248.9 minutes (P=0.026). There was significantly lower intraoperative estimated blood loss in the bipolar sealer group, 407 versus 696 mL (P=0.000). Of the patients with the use of bipolar sealer device, the mean red blood cell transfusion requirement during hospitalization was significantly less than the control group, 0.4 versus 1.1 U/patient (P=0.003). Furthermore, significant difference existed in allogenic blood transfusion rate between the 2 cohorts. Within the study group (with the use of bipolar sealer device), the entire perioperative allogenic blood transfusion rate was 18.0% compared with 40.0% of the control group (P=0.015). There were no complications related directly to the use of the bipolar sealer.Utilization of a bipolar sealer during correction of lumbar degenerative scoliosis may offer comparable hemostatic effects, without prohibitive cost or adverse drug-related risks.",1

Recombinant FVIIa is approved for treatment of bleeding in patients with coagulation abnormalities and has been shown to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements in surgery in patients with no underlying coagulopathy.Forty-nine patients undergoing fusion of 3 or more vertebral segments were randomized and treated on losing 10% of their estimated blood volume (with total expected surgical blood loss > or = 20%) and received 3 doses (2-hour intervals) of placebo (n = 13) or 30, 60, or 120 microg/kg rFVIIa (n = 12 per group). The primary endpoint was safety. A priori-defined efficacy endpoints included blood loss and transfusion requirements between placebo and each rFVIIa dose group, adjusted for surgery duration, number of segments fused, and estimated blood volume.Serious adverse events did not occur at any greater frequency in any of the treatment groups. One patient (3 x 30 microg/kg rFVIIa) with advanced cerebrovascular disease (undiagnosed, trial exclusion criterion) died 6 days after surgery due to an ischemic stroke. Mean blood loss was as follows: 2270 mL for placebo; 1909, 1262, and 1868 mL for 3 x 30, 3 x 60, and 3 x 120 microg/kg rFVIIa, respectively (differences not statistically significant).

METHODS Patients seen at a tertiary care spine center who were undergoing a posterior 2- or 3-level lumbar decompression and fusion were randomized to have Cell Saver used during their surgery (CS group, n = 48) or not used (No Cell Saver [NCS] group, n = 47). Data regarding preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit, estimated blood loss, volume of Cell Saver blood reinfused, number of units and volume of allogeneic blood transfused intraoperatively and postoperatively, complications, and costs were collected. Costs associated with Cell Saver use were calculated based on units of allogeneic blood transfusions averted. RESULTS Demographics and surgical parameters were similar in both groups. The mean estimated blood loss was similar in both groups: 612 ml in the CS group and 742 ml in the NCS group. There were 53 U of allogeneic blood transfused in 29 patients in the NCS group at a total blood product cost of $67,688; and 38 U of allogeneic blood transfused in 16 patients in the CS group at a total blood cost of $113,162, resulting in a cost of $3031 per allogeneic blood transfusion averted using Cell Saver. CONCLUSIONS Cell Saver use produced lower rates of allogeneic transfusion but was found to be more expensive than using only allogeneic blood for 2- and 3-level lumbar degenerative fusions. This increased cost may be reasonable to patients who perceive that the risks associated with allogeneic transfusions are unacceptable. ■ CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE Type of question: therapeutic; study design: randomized controlled trial; evidence: class III.",1

Costs for the health care sector (direct costs), and costs associated with production losses (indirect costs) were calculated. Societal total costs were identified as the sum of direct and indirect costs. Treatment effects were measured using patient global assessment of improvement, back pain (VAS), functional disability (Owestry), and return to work.The societal total cost per patient (standard deviations) in the surgical group was significantly higher than in the nonsurgical group: Swedish kroner (SEK) 704,000 (254,000) vs. SEK 636,000 (208,000). The cost per patient for the health care sector was significantly higher for the surgical group, SEK 123,000 (60,100) vs. 65,200 (38,400) for the control group. All treatment effects were significantly better after surgery. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), illustrating the extra cost per extra effect unit gained by using fusion instead of nonsurgical treatment, were for improvement: SEK 2,600 (600-5,900), for back pain: SEK 5,200 (1,100-11,500), for Oswestry: SEK 11,300 (1,200-48,000), and for return to work: SEK 4,100 (100-21,400).For both the society and the health care sectors, the 2-year costs for lumbar fusion was significantly higher compared with nonsurgical treatment but all treatment effects were significantly in favor of surgery. The probability of lumbar fusion being cost-effective increased with the value put on extra effect units gained by using surgery.",1

In response, a glycerol preservation treatment has been developed to maintain the biomechanical properties of allografts at ambient temperatures, requiring no thawing or rehydration and minimal rinsing prior to implantation. The authors conducted a prospective randomized study to compare the clinical results of glycerol-preserved Cloward dowels and those of freezedried Cloward dowels in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. The primary outcome measures were evidence of fusion and graft subsidence, and the secondary outcome measures included adverse events, pain, and neck disability scores. METHODS Of 106 patients, 53 (113 levels of surgery) were randomly assigned to the glycerol-preserved graft group and 53 (114 levels of surgery) to the freeze-dried graft group. Subsidence was assessed at 3 and 6 months after implantation. Evidence of fusion was evaluated radiographically at 6 months postimplantation. Subsidence was quantitatively assessed based on physical measurements obtained from radiographs by using calibrated comparators, whereas fusion was also evaluated visually. Surgeons were blinded to treatment type during visual and physical assessments of the patients and the radiographs. RESULTS No one in either group had evidence of complete nonunion according to radiographic evaluation at the 6-month follow-up. Average subsidence for all graft-treated levels was 2.11 mm for the glycerol-preserved group and 2.73 mm for the freeze-dried group at the 3-month follow-up and 2.13 and 2.83 mm at the 6-month follow-up, respectively. The 2 treatment groups were statistically equivalent (p = 0.2127 and 0.1705 for the 3- and 6-month follow-up, respectively). No differences were noted between the graft types in terms of adverse event incidence or severity. CONCLUSIONS Glycerol-preserved bone allografts exhibit fusion results and subsidence values similar to those of their freeze-dried counterparts, potentially more favorable biomechanical properties, and significantly shorter preparation times.",1

Tranexamic acid reduces blood loss in high-risk surgery, but the efficacy of a low-dose regimen is unknown.Sixty-one patients undergoing multilevel complex spinal fusion with and without osteotomies were randomly assigned to receive low-dose tranexamic acid (10 mg/kg loading dose, then 1 mg·kg-1·hr-1 throughout surgery) or placebo. The primary outcome was the total volume of red blood cells transfused intraoperatively.Thirty-one patients received tranexamic acid, and 30 patients received placebo. Patient demographics, risk of major transfusion, preoperative hemoglobin, and surgical risk of the 2 groups were similar. There was a significant decrease in total volume of red blood cells transfused (placebo group median 1460 mL vs. tranexamic acid group 1140 mL; median difference 463 mL, 95% confidence interval 15 to 914 mL, P = 0.034), with a decrease in cell saver transfusion (placebo group median 490 mL vs. tranexamic acid group 256 mL; median difference 166 mL, 95% confidence interval 0 to 368 mL, P = 0.042).

There is a strong need to improve training techniques to compensate for these changes. One approach is to use simulation-training methods to shorten the learning curve for surgeons in training.To analyze the effect of surgical training using three-dimensional (3D) simulation on the placement of lateral mass screws in the cervical spine on either cadavers or sawbones.A blinded randomized control study.Fifteen orthopedic residents, postgraduate year (PGY) 1 to 6, were asked to simulate Magerl lateral mass screw trajectories from C3-C7 on cadavers using a navigated drill guide, but with no feedback as to the actual trajectory within the bone (Baseline 1). This was repeated to determine baseline accuracy (Baseline 2). They were then randomized into three groups: Group 1, control, did not receive any training, whereas Groups 2 and 3 received 3D navigational feedback as to the intended drill trajectory on sawbones and cadavers, respectively. All three groups then performed final simulated drilling (final test). All 3D images were deidentified and reviewed by a blinded single fellowship-trained orthopedic spine surgeon. Each image/screw was measured for the starting site, caudad/cephalad angle, and medial/lateral angle to determine trajectory accuracy.The aggregate mean difference from a perfect screw was compiled for each session for each group. A negative difference shows improvement, whereas a positive difference shows regression. The difference between final test and Baseline 1 in the control group was 2.4°, suggesting regression. In contrast, the differences for groups sawbone and cadaver were -8.2° and -7.2°, respectively, suggesting improvement. When comparing the difference in aggregate sum angle for the sawbones and cadaver groups with the control group, the difference was statistically significant (p<.0001).Training with 3D navigation significantly improved the ability of orthopedic residents to properly drill simulated lateral mass screws. As such, training with 3D navigation may be a useful adjunct in resident surgical education.",1

We performed this cadaver study to investigate the effectiveness of virtual surgical training system (VSTS) on cervical pedicle screw instrumentation for residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of ten novice residents were randomly assigned to two groups: the simulation training (ST) group (n = 5) and control group (n = 5). The ST group received a surgical training of cervical pedicle screw placement on VSTS and the control group was given an introductory teaching session before cadaver test. Ten fresh adult spine specimens including 6 males and 4 females were collected, and were randomly allocated to the two groups. The bilateral C3-C6 pedicle screw instrumentation was performed in the specimens of the two groups, respectively. After instrumentation, screw positions of the two groups were evaluated by image examinations. RESULTS: There was significantly statistical difference in screw penetration rates between the ST (10%) and control group (62.5%, P < 0.05). The acceptable rates of screws were 100 and 50% in the ST and control groups with significant difference between each other (P < 0.05). In addition, the average screw penetration distance in the ST group (1.12 ± 0.47 mm) was significantly lower than the control group (2.08 ± 0.39 mm, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the VSTS as an advanced training tool exhibited promising effects on improving performance of novice residents in cervical pedicle screw placement compared with the traditional teaching methods.",1

The results of these trials are encouraging in augmenting the vertebra and reducing the wedge deformity. However, after BK, polymethylmethacrylate leakage remains common after A3.1 AO type fractures, with a frequency per vertebra into the epidural space up to 9.8% but less common (0.03%-5.6%) in A1.1 AO type fracture. KIVA is a novel percutaneous uniportal vertebral augmentation device that is designed to restore the vertebral body and reduce polymethylmethacrylate leakage.From a total 190 patients with osteoporotic fractures who were initially enrolled in this prospective randomized study, 10 patients were excluded (5 met exclusion criteria, 5 with evidence of metastasis). This study examined 82 patients (69 ± 11 yr) with 133 fractures who received KIVA and 86 patients (72 ± 9 yr) with 122 fractures that were reinforced with BK. Anterior (anterior vertebral body height ratio [AVBHr]), midline (midline vertebral body height ratio [MVBHr]), and posterior (posterior vertebral body height ratio [PVBHr]) vertebral body height ratio and Gardner segmental vertebral wedge deformity were measured preoperatively to postoperatively. New fractures were recorded at the final observation. The baseline anthropometric and roentgenographic parameters did not differ between the 2 groups. Any cement leakage was examined on plain roentgenograms and computed tomographic scan. All patients were followed for an average of 14 months (range, 13-15 mo) postoperatively. RESULTS.: At the final observation, both KIVA and BK restored significantly AVBHr, PVBHr, and MVBHr. However, only KIVA device reduced significantly the Gardner angle (P = 0.002). Residual kyphosis of more than 5° was measured significantly more (P < 0.001) in the BK than in KIVA spines. KIVA showed significantly lower (3%, χ2, P ≤ 0.05) leakage) [corrected] (paravertebral, intradiscal) rate per vertebra than BK (0.098%) in which because of intracanal leakage 2 patients developed acute paraplegia and were reoperated in emergency. New fracture rate was similar in both groups. Back pain scores (visual analogue scale), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (Physical Function and Mental Health domains), and Oswestry Disability Index scores improved significantly in the patients of both groups.Both KIVA and BK restored in short-term similarly vertebral body height, but only KIVA restored vertebral body wedge deformity. KIVA was followed by significantly lower and harmless always extracanal leakage rate than BK. Longer observation is needed to show whether these radiological changes have any functional impact.",1

Disc space height and posteroanterior displacement were measured for each lumbar segment using a validated computer-assisted distortion compensated roentgen analysis technique. Values were reported in units of standard deviations above or below age and sex-adjusted normal values. Patient-rated outcomes included the Oswestry Disability Index and pain scales.Radiographs were usable in 355 of 369 (96%) patients (259 fusion and 96 nonoperative treatment). Both treatment groups showed significantly lower values for disc space height of the adjacent segment than norm values. There was a significant difference between treatment groups for the disc space height of the cranial adjacent segment (in both as-treated and intention-to-treat analyses). The mean treatment effect of fusion on adjacent segment disc space height was -0.44 SDs (95% CI, -0.77 to -0.11; P = 0.01; as-treated analysis); there was no group difference for posteroanterior displacement (0.18 SDs, 95% confidence interval, -0.28 to 0.64, P = 0.45). Adjacent level disc space height and posteroanterior displacement were not correlated with Oswestry Disability Index or pain scores at LTFU (r = 0.010-0.05; P > 0.33).Fusion was associated with lower disc space height at the adjacent segment after an average of 13 years of FU. The reduced disc space height had no influence on patient self-rated outcomes (pain or disability).2.",1

Results from a randomized controlled trial,"Fusion is considered the ""gold standard"" in surgical treatment of degenerated disc disease; the intended postoperative goal is absence of mobility, but treatment may induce degeneration in adjacent segments. Total disc replacement (TDR) aims to restore and maintain mobility by replacing a painful disc. Little is known about the degree and quality of mobility in artificial discs in vivo and whether maintained mobility reduces the stress on adjacent segments that is believed to occur after fusion.To see if surgical goals for respective treatments had been reached, if clinical outcome was related to this, and if differences in disc height at treated segments and adjacent segment motion patterns between groups occurred.Comparison of X-ray measurements in a randomized controlled trial between instrumented posterior fusion and TDR for chronic low back pain (CLBP) assumed to be discogenic. Results were compared with clinical outcome.The material consisted of 152 patients suffering from CLBP assumed to be discogenic. Seventy-two patients were treated with fusion and 80 with TDR.Results of X-ray measurements were compared between groups and related to self-reported clinical results regarding back pain and disability.Flexion-extension X-rays were analyzed preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively using distortion-compensated Roentgen analysis (DCRA) at treated and adjacent levels, and mobility after fusion and TDR was estimated. Changes in disc height and range of motion (ROM) respective translation in adjacent segments were compared between groups. Results of DCRA measurements were also compared with the clinical outcome.Preoperative flexion-extension ROM was similar between the fusion and TDR groups, and preoperative disc heights of segments to be treated were between one and two standard deviation less than that previously established in a normative database. Seventy percent of fused patients had no mobility, whereas 85% of TDR patients were mobile. Fulfillment of surgical goals was correlated to neither back pain nor disability. Fused segments were lower and TDR segments were higher than normative values postoperatively. There were also significant differences at adjacent segments, there being more translation and flexion-extension in the fusion group than in the TDR group.This very accurate X-ray method (DCRA) indicates that surgical goals were reached in most patients. This, however, was not correlated to clinical outcome. Differences between the groups in postoperative disc height at treated segments, respective ROM, and translation at adjacent segments did not affect the clinical outcome after 2 years.",1

The method of concealed random allocation without blocking was used to form two groups. The strength training group started rehabilitation 3 weeks after surgery. Patients exercised twice weekly over 9 weeks focusing on muscle activation of lumbopelvic stabilization muscles. The control group followed a standard postoperative protocol, where no exercises were performed at that stage of rehabilitation. Functional outcomes and plain radiographs were evaluated at 3 weeks and subsequently at 3 and 18 months after the surgery.No hardware loosening of failure was observed in the training group. Both groups improved their walking speed after 3 months (p < 0.01), although improvement in the training group was significantly greater than in the control group (p < 0.01). Moreover, the training group significantly improved after the training period in all isometric trunk muscles measurements (p < 0.03), standing reach height (p < 0.02), and pre-activation pattern (p < 0.05). After 18 months, no training effects were observed.The study showed that early initiation of a postoperative rehabilitation program based on principles of strength training is safe, 3 weeks after lumbar spine fusion, and enable earlier functional recovery than standard rehabilitation protocol.The study is registered at the US National Institutes of Health ( ClinicalTrials.gov ) NCT03349580 .

We also examined prognostic factors in relation to the outcome of the procedure.Various studies have examined the therapeutic value of periradicular infiltration using treatment agents consisting of local anesthetic and corticosteroids for radicular pain, secondary to lumbar disc herniation and spinal stenosis. There is currently no randomized trial to determine the efficacy of a single injection of corticosteroids for chronic radicular pain.Eligible patients with radicular pain who had unilateral symptoms who failed conservative management were randomized for a single injection with bupivacaine and methylprednisolone or bupivacaine only. Outcome measures included the Oswestry Disability Index, visual analogue score for back pain and leg pain, claudication walking distance, and the patient's subjective level of satisfaction of the outcome.We recruited 43 patients in the bupivacaine and methylprednisolone group and 43 patients in the bupivacaine only group.

This study aims to investigate the effects of methylene blue (MB) on preventing postoperative low-back pain (LBP) with or without radicular pain and improving the quality of life (QOL) in patients undergoing lumbar open discectomy.This is a prospective, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, which was conducted at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences between July 2011 to January 2012. Of a total of 130 patients, 115 were eligible for participation; 56 received 1 ml of MB solution at a concentration of 0.5% (MB group) and 59 received an equivalent volume of normal saline (control group). Primary outcomes were the control of LBP with or without radicular pain, which was evaluated preoperatively and at 24 hours and 3 months after surgery with the use of a visual analog scale (VAS), and the improvement of QOL, which was assessed preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively by means of the Persian translation of the Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire.The mean VAS scores for LBP were significantly lower in the MB group compared with the control group at 24 hours (1.25 ± 0.97 vs 2.80 ± 0.69, p < 0.001) and 3 months (1.02 ± 1.29 vs 2.07 ± 1.10, p = 0.019) after treatment. The mean radicular pain scores decreased significantly in the 2 groups at 24 hours after surgery, but the mean radicular pain score was significantly lower in the MB-treated patients than the control group. However, the difference between radicular pain scores in the MB group (1 ± 1.1) and the control group (1.2 ± 1) was not statistically significant (p = 0.64). The reduction in LBP was greater in the MB group than the control group (8.11 ± 1.74 vs 6.07 ± 1.52, p = 0.023, CI 95% -1.37 to -0.10). The functional QOL improved significantly 3 months after the operation in both groups (p < 0.001). Moderate disability occurred more frequently in the control group than in the MB group (14.5% vs 7.7%, p = 0.004). No toxicity, adverse effects, or complications were found in the group of patients treated with MB injection.A single dose of MB (1 ml 0.5%) for coating the dura and surrounding tissues (facet and muscle) shows promising results in terms of safety, reduction of postoperative pain, and functional outcome compared with placebo.",1

Both groups received lidocaine hydrochloride injections for pain associated with the procedure. We replicated the design of the previously published study and performed a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess whether the extraordinary effects of MB on pain intensity could be confirmed. The primary outcomes were treatment success defined as at least 30% reduction in pain intensity and the Patients' Global Impression of Change 6 months after the intervention. We included 84 patients with CD-LBP of which 14 (35%) in the MB plus lidocaine group showed treatment success compared with 11 (26.8%) in the control group who received placebo plus lidocaine (P = 0.426). Twenty-seven percent of all participants treated with MB stated that their overall health improved much or very much (Patients' Global Impression of Change), vs 25.6% in the placebo group (P = 0.958). We were unable to confirm that intradiscal MB injections are better capable of significantly reducing pain in patients with CD-LBP 6 months after treatment compared with placebo. We observed that over one-quarter of patients receiving only lidocaine injections reported treatment success, which is in contrast with the previously published study.

Recently, cortical bone trajectory (CBT) has become a new trajectory for screw insertion in the lumbar spine. Several biomechanical studies have demonstrated that the CBT technique achieves screw purchase and strength greater than the traditional method. Currently, the available data on the clinical effectiveness of the two performed surgeries, TLIF with CBT screws (CBT-TLIF) and TLIF with traditional pedicle screws (PS-TLIF), are insufficient. This is the first randomised study to compare CBT-TLIF against traditional PS fixation and will provide recommendations for treating patients with lumbar degenerative disc disorders.A blinded randomised controlled trial (blinding for the patient and statistician, rather than for the clinician and researcher) will be conducted. A total of 254 participants with lumbar disc degenerative disease who are candidates for TLIF surgery will be randomly allocated to either the CBT-TLIF group or the PS-TLIF group at a ratio of 1:1. The primary clinical outcome measures are the incidence of adjacent cranial facet joint violation, fusion rate and the screw loosening rate. Secondary clinical outcome measures are Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of back pain, VAS of leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index, operative time, intraoperative blood loss and complications. These parameters will be evaluated on day 3, and then at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively.This study has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (batch: 2017-03).

Minimally invasive techniques for cervical discectomy including the posterior microendoscopic discectomy and the percutaneous endoscopic discectomy have a high success rate but are limited by the narrow range of indications. Lately, preliminary reports about cervical microendoscopic discectomy and fusion (CMEDF) showed high success rates without restrictions in the indications.Seventy consecutive patients were randomly assigned in 2 equal groups, the first operated by the ""gold standard"" anterior cervical discectomy and fusion and the second by CMEDF. Blinding included the patient-until dressing removal, the evaluating physician, and the radiologist throughout the entire study. The mean follow-up period was 28 months and outcome has been assessed using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, Odom criteria and the visual analogue scale. In addition, the operative time, complication rate, hospitalization, and the postoperative analgesic doses were recorded.The functional outcome of the CMEDF at the final follow-up was 91% good to excellent. Results in the open group were very similar. Meanwhile, CMEDF demonstrated improved cosmesis, reduced laryngopharyngeal complication rate, postoperative analgesics, and hospital stay.The results of the CMEDF are very promising. However, a much larger patient series from multicenter studies is still required for drawing up a final conclusion.1.",1

One-to-one randomization is stratified by site and by one or more prior lumbosacral operations. The sample size of 132 subjects may be adjusted to between 100 and 200 subjects using a standard adaptive design statistical method with pre-defined rules. Crossover treatment is possible. Co-primary endpoints are proportion of subjects reporting ≥50% leg pain relief without crossover at 6 and at 24 months after SCS screening trial or re-operation. Insufficient pain relief constitutes failure of randomized treatment, as does crossover. Secondary endpoints include cost-effectiveness; relief of leg, back, and overall pain; change in disability and quality of life; and rate of crossover. We are collecting data on subject global impression of change, patient satisfaction with treatment, employment status, pain/paresthesia overlap, SCS programming, and adverse events. <h3>Discussion</h3> As the first multicenter randomized controlled trial of SCS versus re-operation and the first to use only rechargeable SCS pulse generators, the EVIDENCE study will provide up-to-date evidence on the treatment of failed back surgery syndrome.",1

Objective This study investigated whether lumbar fusion patients blinded to the harvest site (A) can identify the iliac crest used for bone harvesting and (B) whether this iliac crest is more painful than the contralateral side. Summary of background data Spinal fusion with iliac crest autograft is a frequently performed surgical procedure. A widely reported disadvantage of the harvesting procedure is potential donor site morbidity. This has driven the development of many bone graft substitutes. However, more recently the incidence and severity of donor site pain is debated, especially in lumbar fusion surgery. Methods Ninety-two nontraumatic adult patients underwent a posterolateral (thoraco)lumbar fusion. Iliac crest bone graft was harvested unilaterally through the primary midline incision. At 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year follow-up, patients were asked to identify the donor site and to rate pain in their back, left iliac crest and right iliac crest on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Results Ninety patients, 44 males and 46 females with a mean age of 54 years, were analyzed. The left/right distribution of the iliac crest donor site was 50/50 and 89% of the patients underwent a lumbar fusion below L3. Only 24% patients identified the harvest site correctly. Moreover, the VAS pain scores for the donor site and contralateral iliac crest did not differ and were at each timepoint lower than the scores for back pain. Conclusion This study showed that, during the first year after lumbar fusion surgery via a single midline incision approach, patients could not reliably identify the iliac crest used for bone graft harvesting and this iliac crest was not more painful than the untouched contralateral iliac crest. Therefore, donor site pain should not be the main reason to use bone graft alternatives for lumbar spinal fusion. Level of evidence 2.",1

However, the area around the posterior, superior iliac spine is a frequent site of referred pain for many structures. Therefore, many postoperative spine patients may have pain in the vicinity of the posterior iliac crest that may not in fact be caused by bone graft harvesting. The literature may then overestimate the true incidence of postoperative iliac crest pain.We performed a prospective study testing the hypothesis that patients will not report significantly higher visual analog scores over the graft harvest site when compared with the contralateral, non-harvested side.This is a prospective, randomized cohort study.Patients aged 18-75 years undergoing elective spinal fusion of one to two levels between L4 and S1 for spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis were randomized to left-sided or right-sided iliac crest bone graft (ICBG) donor sites and blinded to the side of harvest.Primary outcome was a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) for pain over the left and right posterior superior iliac spine.Bone graft was harvested via spinal access incisions without making a separate skin incision over the crest. Each patient's non-harvested side served as an internal control. Data points were recorded by patients on their study visit sheets preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively.Forty patients were enrolled in the study (23 females) with an average follow-up of 8.1 months (1.5-12 months). Mean age was 51.7 years (23-77 years). Left- and right-side ICBG harvesting was performed equally between the 40 patients. The average volume of graft harvested from the left was 35.3 mL (15-70 mL) and 36.1 mL (15-60 mL) from the right. There was no statistical difference between preoperative VAS score on the harvested side compared with the non-harvested side (p=.415). Postoperatively, there were consistently higher VAS scores on the operative side; however, these differences were not statistically significant at 6 weeks (p=.111), 3 months (p=.440), 6 months (p=.887), or 12 months (p=.240). Both groups did, however, show statistically significant improvements in VAS scores over time within the operative and nonoperative sides (p<.05). Graft volume had no effect on the VAS scores (p=.382).The current literature does not adequately illuminate the incidence of postoperative pain at the site of harvest and the relative magnitude of this pain in comparison with the patient's residual low back pain. This is the first study to blind the patient to the laterality of bone graft harvesting. Our randomized investigation showed that although pain on the surgical side was slightly higher, it was neither clinically nor statistically different from the nonsurgical side. Our conclusion supports surgeons' use of autologous bone graft, which offers a cost-effective, efficacious spinal fusion supplement.",1

In addition to leg pain, patients can experience back pain, leg numbness and leg weakness resulting in decreased productivity and social activity. The majority of sciatica cases recovers spontaneously and therefore patients are initially treated conservatively with oral pain medication. However, some patients experience intractable pain that severely impedes them and no consensus exists on the optimal conservative treatment to reduce this discomfort in the acute phase of sciatica. The aim of the TEIAS trial is to assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and predictive capability on patient outcome of transforaminal epidural injection (TEI) compared to treatment with standard pain medication.This study is designed as a prospective, open-label, mono-centered, randomized controlled trial. Patients that visit their general practitioner with complaints of radicular leg pain and meet the selection criteria are asked to participate in this study. Eligible patients will be randomized to treatment with TEI or to treatment with standard oral pain medication. Treatment of TEI will comprise lidocaine with methylprednisolone acetate for L3 and below and lidocaine with dexamethasone above L3. A total of 142 patients will be recruited and follow-up will occur after 1, 2, 4, 10 and 21 weeks for assessment of pain, functionality, patient received recovery and cost-effectiveness. The primary outcome will be the average score for leg pain at 2 weeks. For this outcome we defined a clinically relevant difference as 1.5 on the 11-point NRS scale.Adequate conservative treatment in the acute phase of sciatica is lacking, particularly for patients with severe symptoms. Focusing on effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and predictive capability on patient outcome of TEI will produce useful information allowing for more lucid decision making in the conservative treatment of sciatica in the acute phase.This trial is registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov database under registry number NCT03924791 on April 23, 2019.",1

However, no study has examined whether unilateral fixation improves surgical outcome. The authors conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial with a minimum 2-year follow-up to analyze TLIF outcomes for 2 techniques: placement of a unilateral PS and a cage compared with placement of bilateral PSs and 2 cages. Methods Fifty patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis undergoing single-level TLIF were randomly assigned to receive either unilateral or bilateral fixation. Parameters compared between the groups were surgical invasiveness, severity of intermittent claudication, pre- and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores (from 0 to 10 for back pain, lower-extremity pain, and lower-extremity numbness), postoperative disability scores for lumbar spinal disorders (Japanese Orthopaedic Association Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire [JOABPEQ]), and fusion rates. Results The mean operative time for TLIF was significantly (p = 0.05) shorter and mean estimated blood loss was significantly lower in the unilateral than in the bilateral group. Intermittent claudication improved in response to each technique, but there was no significant intergroup difference. The unilateral group had a nonsignificant tendency toward less improvement in VAS score for back pain (1.5 vs 3.7 for the bilateral group) and exhibited significantly less improvement in VAS score for lower-extremity pain (2.1 vs 5.1, respectively) and numbness (1.7 vs 4.4). There were no significant differences between the groups in postsurgical scores for all 5 items of the JOABPEQ. The fusion rates were 87.5% (21 of 24 patients) in the unilateral group and 95.7% (22 of 23) in the bilateral group. Conclusions Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion involving unilateral PS fixation and a single-cage technique is less invasive than a 2-cage technique and bilateral fixation, and it improved patients' symptoms. However, it resulted in less improvement in back pain, lower-extremity pain, and lower-extremity numbness. When considering unilateral PS fixation and a single cage, the surgeon should be aware of the potential limitations of this technique. Clinical trial registration no.: UMIN000007833 (UMIN).",1

There are many options, including bone grafts, bone cement, and spacers made of titanium, carbon fiber, and synthetic materials, used to restore physiological disk height and enhance spinal fusion, but the ideal device, which would provide immediate structural support and subsequent osteointegration and stability, has not been identified yet. To overcome this, we designed a new, inexpensive Acrylic cage.A total of 64 patients were eligible to participate and were randomly allocated to undergo ACDF either with Acrylic interbody fusion cage filled with bone substitute (n=32) or PEEK cage (n=32). Nurick's grading was used for quantifying the neurological deficit. Clinical and radiologic outcome was assessed preoperatively, immediately after surgery, and subsequently at 2, 6, and 12 months of follow-up using Odom's criteria and dynamic radiographs (flexion-extension) and computed tomography scans, respectively.There was a statistically significant improvement in the clinical outcomes of the Acrylic cage group compared with the PEEK cage group (mean difference: -0.438; 95% confidence interval, -0.807 to -0.068; P=0.016). There was a statistically significant difference in disk space height increase between the 2 groups at the 6- and 12-month follow-up. The Acrylic cage achieved higher fusion rate (good fusion) than the PEEK cage (96.9% vs. 93.8%). Intervertebral angle demonstrated a significant difference among the 2 treated groups throughout the follow-up period.This study suggests that the use of Acrylic cage is associated with good clinical and radiologic outcomes and it can be therefore a good substitute for bone graft and other cages in ACDF.",1

However, PRP's effect on bone union after spinal surgery remains unclear.The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of PRP after posterolateral lumbar fusion (PLF) surgery.Single-center prospective randomized controlled clinical trial with 2-year follow-up.The patient sample included a total 62 patients (31 patients in the PRP group or 31 patients in the control group).The outcome measures included the bone fusion rate, the area of bone fusion mass, the duration of bone fusion, and the clinical score using the visual analog scale (VAS).We randomized 62 patients who underwent one- or two-level instrumented PLF for lumbar degenerative spondylosis with instability to either the PRP (31 patients) or the control (31 patients) groups. Platelet-rich plasma-treated patients underwent surgery using an autograft bone chip (local bone), and PRP was prepared from patient blood samples immediately before surgery; patients from the control group underwent PLF without PRP treatment. We assessed platelet counts and growth factor concentrations in PRP prepared immediately before surgery. The duration of bone union, the postoperative bone fusion rate, and the area of fusion mass were assessed using plain radiography every 3 months after surgery and by computed tomography at 12 or 24 months. The duration of bone fusion and the clinical scores for low back pain, leg pain, and leg numbness before and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery were evaluated using VAS.Data from 50 patients with complete data were included. The bone union rate at the final follow-up was significantly higher in the PRP group (94%) than in the control group (74%) (p=.002). The area of fusion mass was significantly higher in the PRP group (572 mm2) than in the control group (367 mm2) (p=.02). The mean period necessary for union was 7.8 months in the PRP group and 9.8 months in the control group (p=.013). In the PRP, the platelet count was 7.7 times higher and the growth factor concentrations were 50 times higher than those found in plasma (p<.05). There was no significant difference in low back pain, leg pain, and leg numbness in either group at any time evaluated (p>.05).Patients treated with PRP showed a higher fusion rate, greater fusion mass, and more rapid bone union after spinal fusion surgery than patients not treated with PRP.",1

This is the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the potential advantages of using PRP in posterolateral fusion. Materials and Methods Thirty-nine patients diagnosed with spinal canal stenosis were divided equally into “PRP” and “control” groups. The PRP patients underwent posterolateral fusion with instrumentation using autograft bone plus PRP, while control patients underwent the same procedure minus PRP. In the PRP group, one unit of whole blood (400 mL) was drawn from each patient at the beginning of surgery and centrifuged to extract platelets. Twenty mL of PRP was obtained, to which thrombin and CaCl2 were added to form a platelet gel for application to the surgical field. Bone fusion was periodically assessed using X-ray and CT. Results The average platelet concentration was 7.7-fold higher in the PRP than plasma. Growth factors released from the platelet gel were more than 50-fold concentrated compared with blood levels. No significant adverse events were observed. Bone union was observed in all patients. The average period was 7.8 months in the PRP group, and 9.8 months in the control group.

No significant adverse events were observed. Bone union was observed in all patients. The average period was 7.8 months in the PRP group, and 9.8 months in the control group. Conclusion In the present study, bone union was achieved more rapidly in the PRP group, which suggests that enhanced bone formation was achieved by providing an elevated concentration of PRP.

Patients and Methods From January 2008 to July 2009, 99 patients were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups, those having a Mobi-C implant (n = 51; 30 men, 21 women) and those undergoing ACDF (n = 48; 28 men, 20 women).The patients were followed up for five years, with the primary outcomes being the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, visual analogue scale for pain and the incidence of further surgery. The secondary outcomes were the Neck Disability Index and range of movement (ROM) of the treated segment. Results The incidence of further surgery was found to be statistically significant between the two groups (p = 0.49), with seven ACDF patients requiring further surgery and only one Mobi-C patient requiring re-operation. There were significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) between the two groups in the ROM of the treated segment. However, both Mobi-C surgery and ACDF surgery were effective in improving the patient’s clinical symptoms.

However, local steroid delivery following lumbar fusion procedures has not been well characterized. This study aims to characterize the effect of local intraoperative depomedrol application on perioperative and postoperative outcomes following a single-level minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS TLIF). METHODS A prospective, randomized, single-blinded study was performed. A priori power analysis determined that 86 patients were needed to detect a difference of 1 point in the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score between groups. Ninety-three patients were randomized into depomedrol (DEPO) and no depomedrol (NODEPO) cohorts. Prior to surgical closure, DEPO patients received 1 ml depomedrol (80 mg) applied directly to the surgical site by using a Gelfoam carrier. NODEPO patients received 1 ml saline on the same Gelfoam carrier. Perioperative outcomes including acute postoperative pain and narcotic use were assessed for the duration of inpatient stay. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) questionnaires including VAS back and leg pain scores, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were administered preoperatively and at 6-week, 12-week, and 6-month follow-up. Outcomes for DEPO and NODEPO cohorts were compared using linear regression controlled for sex. RESULTS Of the 93 patients, 45 (48.4%) were randomized to DEPO and 48 (51.6%) to NODEPO. A greater percentage of DEPO patients were female (53.3% vs 27.1%, p = 0.010). There were no other significant differences in patient baseline characteristics. Similarly, operating time, estimated blood loss, and length of inpatient stay did not differ between cohorts. Patients in the DEPO cohort consumed fewer hourly narcotics on postoperative day 0 (5.3 vs 6.3 oral morphine equivalents/hour, p = 0.034). However, no differences in acute postoperative pain or total narcotics consumption were observed between groups. Preoperative VAS leg scores were statistically different between cohorts (p = 0.027). However, preoperative ODI and VAS back scores did not differ between groups. Additionally, DEPO and NODEPO groups experienced similar improvements in PROs at all postoperative time points. CONCLUSIONS Local depomedrol use did not lead to decreases in acute postoperative pain or narcotics consumption after MIS TLIF. Additionally, local depomedrol was not associated with postoperative improvements in PROs. The findings of this randomized trial suggest that surgical and clinical outcomes following MIS TLIF may not be impacted by intraoperative application of depomedrol.

The aim of this parallel-group randomized trial was to assess the effect of the long-duration opioid methadone on postoperative analgesic requirements, pain scores, and patient satisfaction after complex spine surgery. Methods One hundred twenty patients were randomized to receive either methadone 0.2 mg/kg at the start of surgery or hydromorphone 2 mg at surgical closure. Anesthetic care was standardized, and clinicians were blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was intravenous hydromorphone consumption on postoperative day 1. Pain scores and satisfaction with pain management were measured at postanesthesia care unit admission, 1 and 2 h postadmission, and on the mornings and afternoons of postoperative days 1 to 3. Results One hundred fifteen patients were included in the analysis. Median hydromorphone use was reduced in the methadone group not only on postoperative day 1 (4.56 vs. 9.90 mg) but also on postoperative days 2 (0.60 vs. 3.15 mg) and 3 (0 vs. 0.4 mg; all P&amp;lt; 0.001). Pain scores at rest, with movement, and with coughing were less in the methadone group at 21 of 27 assessments (all P = 0.001 to &amp;lt; 0.0001). Overall satisfaction with pain management was higher in the methadone group than in the hydromorphone group until the morning of postoperative day 3 (all P = 0.001 to &amp;lt; 0.0001). Conclusions Intraoperative methadone administration reduced postoperative opioid requirements, decreased pain scores, and improved patient satisfaction with pain management.",1

However, in the PSF surgery of patients with AIS, the use of surgical zipper has not been described.Ninety female patients with AIS undergoing PSF were assigned randomly to 2 incision closure groups either using surgical zipper or using the 4-0 absorbable subcuticular suture. The incision outcome was evaluated with the Hollander Incision Evaluation Score at 7 days, 2 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery, respectively. Besides, a visual analogue scale was allocated to each patient to rate the cosmetic result of the incision. The 2 groups were compared to determine the differences in terms of incision closure time, the complication rate, and cosmetic results.The incision closure using surgical zipper consumed significantly less time than that using subcuticular suture (45.3 vs. 540.5 s, P < 0.001). As for the cosmetic results, no significant differences of Hollander Incision Evaluation Score scores between the 2 suturing groups were found. Besides, patients' satisfaction with cosmetic outcome on a linear visual analogue scale also revealed similar results between the 2 groups. As for postoperative complications, we found 1 case of mild blister due to allergy to the tape of the dressings and 2 cases of incisional pain in the Monocryl suture group.The application of surgical zipper in PSF surgery is a safe and effective method. The ease and the speed of application make surgical zipper an attractive option for incision closure in patients with AIS undergoing PSF.4.",1

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and complication rates of the 3 different PEAN anatomical approaches (caudal, S1 foraminal, and L5-S1 transforaminal) used to treat PLSS. Study Design: This study used a case control, blind study. Setting: The research took place at the pain clinic and interventional pain practice room at Asyut University Hospital, Assiut, Egypt. Methods: Sixty consecutive PLSS patients were recruited and randomized into 3 groups (caudal, S1 foraminal, and L5-S1 transforaminal) before receiving adhesiolysis and neuroplasty. All patients underwent nerve conduction studies and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pain severity levels were assessed and measured using the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (OSW) and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a Likert scale. The first assessment was performed prior to the procedure to determine the patients’ baseline levels of pain severity. Followup assessments were performed 1-, 3-, and 6-months after the procedure. Results: Results of the group pairwise analysis indicated that, relative to baseline, there were significant decreases in pain relief scores (VAS and OWS) and functional assessment expressed by patients’ satisfaction across all time intervals and in all 3 groups (P &lt; 0.01). Conversely, a between group analysis revealed that VAS, OWS, and patient satisfaction scores were comparable across the 3 groups at all time intervals (P &gt; 0.05). There were no differences in rates of complications between the 3 different groups. Limitations: Our study was limited by the low number of patients and the short duration (6 months) of follow-up. Conclusion: The 3 anatomical approaches (caudal, S1 foraminal, and L5-S1 transforaminal) result in the same outcome with regard to pain relief and complication rate.

Patients in group A, B, and C were treated with three-level percutaneous fixation, two-level percutaneous fixation, and three-level open fixation, respectively. Blood loss, duration of surgery, VAS scores, Cobb angles, and anterior height ratios of fractured vertebrae were collected for statistical analysis.The average follow-up was 17.7 months. Post-operative Cobb angles were significantly corrected and anterior height ratios of fractured vertebrae were well restored in all three groups (p < 0.01). Back pain was efficiently relieved according to VAS score change (p < 0.01). There were significant differences in values of blood loss and post-operative VAS scores (at three months) between group A and group C (p < 0.01). No significant difference concerning post-operative anterior height ratios of fractured vertebrae, Cobb angles and correction losses was observed between group A and group B (p = 0.580, 0.840, 0.215, respectively).Percutaneous fixation not only provides the same reduction effect as open fixation, but also has an advantage of causing less operation related trauma which is beneficial to post-operative rehabilitation. The efficacy of three-level percutaneous fixation and two-level percutaneous fixation in the treatment of type A thoracolumbar fractures is not significantly different.",1

Early postoperative outcomes were evaluated using clinical and surgical technique-related outcomes. The visual analog scale (VAS) pain score was measured at 6 time points after surgery (at 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 hours and 2 weeks). Surgical technique-related outcomes were also analyzed.There were no significant differences in the preoperative demographics between the 2 groups. The VAS pain score from 8 to 48 hours (P < 0.05) was significantly lower in the BE-D group than in the MI-D group. Moreover, the total amount of fentanyl usage was higher in the MI-D group than in the BE-D group after surgery (P = 0.026). The length of hospital stay was lower in the BE-D group than in the MI-D group (P = 0.048). The operative time and creatinine phosphokinase level were not significantly different between the groups (P >0.05).

The goals of this study were to evaluate the effects of operative and nonoperative treatment and to assess the benefits of these treatments to help treating physicians determine whether patients are better managed operatively or nonoperatively.Patients with adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis (aged 40 to 80 years, with a coronal Cobb angle measurement of ≥30° and an Oswestry Disability Index [ODI] score of ≥20 or Scoliosis Research Society [SRS]-22 score of ≤4.0) from 9 North American centers were enrolled in concurrent randomized or observational cohorts to evaluate operative versus nonoperative treatment. The primary outcomes were differences in the mean change from baseline in the SRS-22 subscore and ODI at 2-year follow-up. For the randomized cohort, the initial sample-size calculation estimated that 41 patients per group (82 total) would provide 80% power with alpha equal to 0.05, anticipating 10% loss to follow-up and 20% nonadherence in the nonoperative arm. However, an interim sample-size calculation estimated that 18 patients per group would be sufficient.Sixty-three patients were enrolled in the randomized cohort: 30 in the operative group and 33 in the nonoperative group. Two hundred and twenty-three patients were enrolled in the observational cohort: 112 in the operative group and 111 in the nonoperative group. The intention-to-treat analysis of the randomized cohort found that, at 2 years of follow-up, outcomes did not differ between the groups. Nonadherence was high in the randomized cohort (64% nonoperative-to-operative crossover). In the as-treated analysis of the randomized cohort, operative treatment was associated with greater improvement at the 2-year follow-up in the SRS-22 subscore (adjusted mean difference, 0.7 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.5 to 1.0]) and in the ODI (adjusted mean difference, -16 [95% CI, -22 to -10]) (p < 0.001 for both). Surgery was also superior to nonoperative care in the observational cohort at 2 years after treatment on the basis of SRS-22 subscore and ODI outcomes (p < 0.001). In an overall responder analysis, more operative patients achieved improvement meeting or exceeding the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in the SRS-22 subscore (85.7% versus 38.7%; p < 0.001) and the ODI (77.4% versus 38.3%; p < 0.001). Thirty-four revision surgeries were performed in 24 (14%) of the operative patients.On the basis of as-treated and MCID analyses, if a patient with adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis is satisfied with current spine-related health, nonoperative treatment is advised, with the understanding that improvement is unlikely. If a patient is not satisfied with current spine health and expects improvement, surgery is preferred.Therapeutic Level II.

Endoscopic techniques offer advantages and the benefits of rehabilitation, which have become the standard in many surgical operations when operating on the spine. A significant issue has been the upgrading of instruments to provide enough bone resection under continuous visual control. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined patients who had LDH with lateral recess stenosis and compared the results of nerve root canal decompression using percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) with a microsurgical laminotomy (ML) technique. In this study 40 patients with full endoscopic decompression or microsurgery were followed up for 2 years. In addition to general and specific parameters, the following two parameters were also used for the investigation: the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). RESULTS: Except for 1 patient in whom repair was done by fusion and 1 who was lost to follow-up, 38 patients remained in the study over the 2 years. The mean operating time in the PELD group was longer (p < 0.05), but intraoperative and postoperative blood loss was less than in the ML group (p < 0.05). The postoperative results were better than before surgery, and the VAS and ODI parameters indicated a clear improvement in leg pain and daily activities in both groups (p > 0.05). Of the patients three suffered increasing back pain (2 ML, 1 PELD). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the PELD can provide an effective supplement and serve as an alternative for LDH with lateral recess stenosis compared with the ML technique when the indication criteria are fulfilled. The PELD also has the advantage of being a minimally invasive intervention.",1

Persisting CSF leakage can occur even after ID repair and requires revision surgery. Prolonged flat bed rest (BR) to reduce the incidence of persisting CSF leakage is frequently applied but highly debated. A randomized controlled trial comparing prolonged BR versus early ambulation after ID repair is lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of revision surgery as a result of persistent cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) leakage and medical complications after immediate or late post-operative ambulation following ID during decompressive spinal surgery.MethodsNinety-four of 1429 consecutive cases undergoing lumbar spine surgery (6.58%) were complicated by an ID. Sixty patients (mean age of 64 ± 13.28 years) were randomized to either early post-operative ambulation (EA, n = 30) or flat BR for 48 h (BR, n = 30). The incidence of CSF leakage resulting in revision surgery, medical complications and duration of hospitalization were compared between groups.ResultsTwo patients in the BR group and two patients in the EA group underwent revision surgery as a result of persisting CSF leakage. Four patients in the BR group experienced medical complications associated with prolonged immobilization. The duration of hospitalization was 7.25 ± 3.0 days in the BR group versus 6.56 ± 2.64 days in the EA group, p = 0.413.ConclusionThe results of this study indicate no benefit of prolonged BR after an adequately repaired ID in lumbar spine surgery.Level of evidenceLevel 1b (individual randomized controlled trial).Graphic abstractThese slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 51 participants with T11-L2 TCBFs (AO classification: A3) were randomly assigned to receive SSRAI or DSRAI. Key preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative data were collected. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine the independent factors associated with inferior clinical outcomes, as well as the comparative efficacy of SSRAI and DSRAI. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the key demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups (all p>0.05). Smoking status was significantly associated with inferior three-month and six-month Denis pain scores (Wald statistic=4.246, p=0.039). Both SSRAI and DSRAI were significantly effective in improving three-month and six-month postoperative degree of kyphosis, three-month and six-month postoperative ASIA impairment scale scores, three-month and six-month postoperative Denis pain score, and three-month and six-month postoperative Denis work score (all p<0.001). Although there were no significant differences between DSRAI and SSRAI with respect to all outcomes (all p>0.05), DSRAI displayed significantly longer operating times, as well as significantly larger operative blood losses (both p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS SSRAI may be preferable over DSRAI for TCBFs with incomplete neurological deficit due to its lower operating time and amount of operative blood loss.",1

METHODS Patients with a traumatic single-level TLBFs (T10-L2), treated at our hospital between December 2009 and December 2014, were randomly allocated to Group A (PPMA) and Group B (PA). Sex, age, time from injury to surgery, the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale score (ASIAIS), comorbidities, vertebral level, pre- and postoperative kyphotic angle (KA), visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were included in the analysis. Operative time, intraoperative blood loss, x-ray exposure time, postoperative drainage volume, superficial infection, and occurrence of deep infection were documented. The patients were followed up at 2 weeks; 1, 3, and 6 months; 1 and 2 years; and every 6 months thereafter. Radiological assessments were performed to assess fracture union and detect potential loosening and breakage of the pedicle screws and rods at each follow-up. Postoperative VAS and ODI scores were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes. RESULTS A total of 62 patients were enrolled (30 in Group A and 32 in Group B, respectively). The operative time (P < .001) and x-ray exposure time (P < .001) in Group A were significantly longer than those in Group B. However, compared to Group B, there were less intraoperative blood loss (P < .001), lower postoperative drainage volume (P < .001), lower VAS scores (2-week (P = .029), 1-month (P = .023), 3-month (P = .047), and 6-month follow-up (P = .010)), and lower ODI scores (2-week, P = .010; 1-month, P < .001; 3-month, P = .028; and 6-month follow-up, P = .033) in Group A. CONCLUSIONS Although PPMA required a longer operative time and x-ray exposure time, PPMA provided several advantages over PA, including less intra-operative blood loss and lower postoperative drainage volume, and greater satisfaction with postoperative pain relief and functional improvement, than PA, especially at the 6-month follow-up after surgery. Further high-quality multicenter studies are warranted to validate our findings.",1

Health economic evaluation is urgently needed to justify the continued use of TC, given that this treatment is less effective and, all things being equal, is assumed more costly than FRA.Eighty-three patients were randomly allocated to receive either the TC or FRA as part of a circumferential lumbar fusion between 1998 and 2002. NHS costs related to the surgery and revision surgery needed during the trial period were monitored and adjusted to the base year (2005-2006 Pounds Sterling). The Short Form-6D (SF-6D) was administered before surgery and at 6, 12 and 24 months in order to elicit patient utility and subsequently Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for the trial period. Return to paid employment was also monitored. Bootstrapped mean differences in discounted costs and benefits were generated in order to explore cost-effectiveness.A significant cost difference of pound 1950 (95% CI, pound 849 to pound 3145) in favor of FRA was found. Mean QALYs per patient over the 24-month trial period were 0.0522 (SD, 0.0326) in the TC group and 0.1914 (SD, 0.0398) in the FRA group, producing a significant difference of -0.1392 (95% CI, -0.2349 to -0.0436). With regard to employment, incremental productivity costs were estimated at pound 185,171 in favor of FRA.From an NHS perspective, the trial data show that TC is not cost-effective in circumferential lumbar fusion. The use of FRA was both cheaper and generated greater QALY gains. In addition, FRA patients reported a greater return to work rate.",1

Objective The aim of this study was to compare the complication rate in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) posterior spinal fusion (PSF) surgery with and without drainage. Summary of background data PSF is the mainstay of surgical treatment for AIS. Drains are commonly used despite contradictory findings in the literature for their having any clear advantage. Methods A total of 100 AIS patients undergoing instrumented PSF were blindly randomized into two groups of either a deep or drain. The collected data included wound follow-up findings, hemoglobin, hematocrit, vital signs and fever levels, and mean 20 months follow-up. Results Fifty-two patients were randomly allocated to the no group and 48 to the drain group. There were differences in patient characteristics, surgical data, and hemoglobin and hematocrit levels between the two groups. Only 4 units of packed cells were given in total. Fever during the first postoperative 1 to 3 days was equal, but increased in the group on day 6 (P = 0.017). Length of hospitalization was equal (6 days) for all the patients. The mean follow-up period was 20 months [8.5-30.7 (SD 6.4)]. Complications included one case (1.9%) of pneumonia in the group, wound dehiscence in two cases (3.8%) in the group and in one case (2.1%) in the drain group, and two cases (3.8%) of superficial wound infection in the group. There was case of deep infection in either group. Conclusion The current results indicate that there is advantage to deep drainage in AIS patients undergoing PSF. The number of wound healing complications was low and identical for both the and no-drain groups. Level of evidence 2.",1

All patients received a 7-day course of oral antiviral treatment, pregabalin, and analgesics as needed. The primary efficacy was assessed on the basis of HZ burden of illness (HZ-BOI) scores over 30 days (BOI-30AUC ). Secondary outcomes included HZ-BOI scores through 30 to 90 days (BOI-30-90AUC ) and 90 to 180 days (BOI-90-180AUC ), quality of life (QoL) outcomes, concomitant analgesic consumption, and the incidence of PHN. Adverse events were recorded to evaluate safety.The BOI-30AUC values were 92.55 and 112.72 for the treatment and placebo groups, respectively (P < 0.01). Both the BOI-30-90AUC and BOI-90-180AUC in the treatment group were lower than those in the placebo group (P < 0.01). The incidence of PHN at 90 days was significantly less than that at 180 days in the treatment group (P = 0.036). A better improvement in QoL was found in the treatment group (P < 0.05). There was a greater decrease in analgesic use in the treatment group as compared to the placebo group (P < 0.05).

DBMs are a class of commercially available grafting agents that are prepared from allograft bone. Many such products have been commercially available for clinical use; however, their efficacy for spine fusion has been mostly based on anecdotal evidence rather than randomized controlled clinical trials.Forty-six patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive Grafton DBM Matrix with local bone (30 patients) or autologous ICBG (16 patients). The mean age was 64 (females [F] = 21, males [M] = 9) in the DBM group and 65 (F = 9, M = 5) in the ICBG group. An independent radiologist evaluated plain radiographs and computed tomographic scans at 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year time points. Clinical outcomes were measured using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey.Forty-one patients (DBM = 28 and ICBG = 13) completed the 2-year follow-up. Final fusion rates were 86% (Grafton Matrix) versus 92% (ICBG) (P = 1.0 not significant). The Grafton group showed slightly better improvement in ODI score than the ICBG group at the final 2-year follow-up (Grafton [16.2] and ICBG [22.7]); however, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.2346 at 24 mo). Grafton showed consistently higher physical function scores at 24 months; however, differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.0823). Similar improvements in the physical component summary scores were seen in both the Grafton and ICBG groups. There was a statistically significant greater mean intraoperative blood loss in the ICBG group than in the Grafton group (P < 0.0031).At 2-year follow-up, subjects who were randomized to Grafton Matrix and local bone achieved an 86% overall fusion rate and improvements in clinical outcomes that were comparable with those in the ICBG group.",1

Postoperative pain relief was achieved with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with morphine. The preemptive analgesia group received oral pregabalin (150 mg) and celecoxib (200 mg) 2 hrs before surgery, and the control group received a placebo. Pain was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS). Side effects and morphine consumption were monitored until 48 hrs after surgery.VAS score at rest and during movement was statistically significantly lower in the preemptive analgesia group at most time points (p<0.05). Morphine consumption was significantly lower in the preemptive analgesia group compared with control group in the 24 first hours (29.03±4.38 mg vs 24.43±4.94) and 48 hrs (52.23±9.57 mg vs 44.20±10.21 mg), p<0.05. Hemodynamics, respiratory rate, and SpO2 were similar for both groups. The sedation score was only statistically significant at H8 time point. The incidence of nausea/vomiting in the preemptive group did not statistically differ from the control group.Preoperative administration of pregabalin combined with celecoxib had a good preemptive analgesia effect and reduced intravenous morphine consumption after lumbar spine surgery.

All patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: the study group (n=231) and the control group (n=231). Patients in the study group received TESSYS, while those in the control group received conventional surgical treatment with posterior approach. Venous blood was collected before the surgery and 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h after surgery. C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and white blood cell (WBC) in each patient were measured. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, length of stay, postoperative ambulation time and complications were compared between the two groups. Clinical efficacy before and after surgery (1st day, 1st month, 3rd month, and 6th month after surgery) was evaluated according to visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI) and modified MacNab criteria.The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, length of stay, postoperative ambulation time and complications of patients in the study group were less than those of the control group (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in VAS score and ODI score on the 1st day before surgery, 1st day, 1st, 3rd, and 6th month after surgery (p>0.05).

Between January 2003 and October 2006, 30 patients who underwent revision lumbar spine surgery were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a study group (A) and a control group (B). Once peridural fibrosis was exposed, MESNA (Uromixetan MESNA, 50 mg/ml) was intraoperatively applied on the fibrous tissue (Group A) to ease tissue dissection and enter the canal. In patients of Group B, saline solution was used. Surgical time, preoperative and 1 week postoperative hemoglobin (Hb), length of hospitalization (days), and incidence of perioperative complications were evaluated. The blinded surgeon assigned the surgeries to one of four categories as none, minimal, moderate, and severe basing on intraoperative difficulty in dissecting the fibrous tissue and intraoperative bleeding. Statistical analysis used chi-square analysis to evaluate the difference in surgery difficulty and the incidence of intraoperative complications between the two groups. The analysis of surgical time and hemoglobin levels was performed using a one-sample Wilcoxon test and Mann-Whitney U test. Patients in whom MESNA was used intraoperatively (Group A) presented better intraoperative and perioperative parameters with respect to the control group. Average surgical time and decrease in Hb postoperatively were more in the saline group (B) respect to MESNA (A) (P = 0.004 and P = 0.001, respectively), while no difference in average hospital stay was reported between the two groups. Surgeon-blinded intraoperative report on surgical difficulty showed a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). Postoperatively, no complications directly attributable to the use of MESNA were experienced. The incidence of dural tears and intraoperative bleeding from epidural veins were significantly less in Group A with respect to the control group. MESNA contributed significantly to reduce the operative complications, with a diminution of the surgical time and the grade of difficult for the surgeon, confirming its ability as chemical dissector also for epidural fibrosis in revision lumbar spine surgery.",1

To determine that after 6 months there would be no clinical differences between the control and study group.Low back pain is the most common long-term complication after lumbar discectomy. It is mainly caused by intervertebral disc space loss, which promotes progressive degeneration. This is the first study to test the efficiency of a previously described method (vertebral end-plate perforation) that should advocate for annulus fibrosus reparation and disc space restoration.We selected 30 eligible patients according to inclusion and exclusion criteria and randomly assigned them to the control (no end-plate perforation) or study (end-plate perforation) group. Each patient was evaluated in 5 different periods, where data were collected [preoperative and 6-mo follow-up magnetic resonance imaging and functional outcome data: visual analogue scale (VAS) back, VAS legs, Oswestry disability index (ODI)]. Intervertebral space volume (ISV) and height (ISH) were measured form the magnetic resonance images. Statistical analysis was performed using paired t test and linear regression. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.We found no statistically significant difference between the control group and the study group concerning ISV (P=0.6808) and ISH (P=0.8981) 6 months after surgery. No statistically significant differences were found between ODI, VAS back, and VAS legs after 6 months between the 2 groups, however, there were statistically significant differences between these parameters in different time periods. Correlation between the volume of disc tissue removed and preoperative versus postoperative difference in ISV was statistically significant (P=0.0020).The present study showed positive correlation between the volume of removed disc tissue and decrease in postoperative ISV and ISH. There were no statistically significant differences in ISV and ISH between the group with end-plate perforation and the control group 6 months after lumbar discectomy. Clinical outcome and disability were significantly improved in both groups 3 and 6 months after surgery.",1

This complication has been attributed to ischemic optic neuropathy, with one proposed reason being perioperative elevations in intraocular pressure (IOP). Previous research has studied the effects of table inclination on IOP in awake volunteers; however, the effects in spine surgery patients have not been investigated for reverse Trendelenburg positioning using a prospective, randomized controlled study design.To assess the effect of table inclination on IOP in patients undergoing prone spine surgery.Single-center, prospective randomized controlled study.Nineteen patients with no history of eye pathology, undergoing prone spine surgery at Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center, were randomly assigned to a table position: neutral, 5°, or 10° of reverse Trendelenburg.Intraocular pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), estimated blood loss, fluid resuscitation, and ophthalmologic complication were assessed before and after induction and at incremental times during surgery, beginning at 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and 60-minute increments thereafter.Multivariate analyses evaluated surgical time, IOP, MAP, estimated blood loss, and fluid resuscitation as a function of table inclination to determine the effect of patient positioning on identified risk factors for postoperative vision loss.Surgical times ranged from 33 to 325 minutes. A rapid increase in IOP was noted after prone positioning, with continued increases as time elapsed. The neutral group exhibited statistically higher IOP compared with the 5° reverse Trendelenburg group after 60 minutes and the 10° group through 60 minutes of surgery. The trend continued through 120 minutes; however, because of a lack of power, we were unable to determine the statistical significance. There were no statistically significant differences between the 5° and 10° reverse Trendelenburg groups.Reverse Trendelenburg positioning elicits decreased IOP compared with prone positioning for surgery times less than 120 minutes. Ten degrees of reverse Trendelenburg attenuate the rise in IOP during prone spine surgery superiorly in comparison with 5°. No significant complications were associated with reverse Trendelenburg positioning.",1

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) results in decreased perfusion and possibly ischemic optic neuropathy. We performed a randomized, prospective trial to evaluate the effect of head positioning on IOP during lumbar spine fusion.The study included fifty-two patients treated at one institution. Inclusion criteria were a lumbar spine fusion and an age of eighteen to eighty years. Exclusion criteria were a diagnosis of tumor, infection, or traumatic injury or a history of eye disease, ocular surgery, cervical spine surgery, chronic neck pain, or cervical stenosis. The control group underwent the surgery with the head in neutral and the face parallel to the level operating room table whereas, in the experimental group, the neck was extended so that the face had a 10° angle of inclination in relation to the table. IOP measurements were recorded along with the corresponding blood pressure and PCO2 values at the same time points. The primary outcome measure was the change in intraocular pressure (ΔIOP, defined as the maximum IOP minus the initial IOP).Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used for categorical risk factors, and regression analysis was used for continuous risk factors. The mean ΔIOP, corrected for duration of surgery, was significantly (p = 0.0074) lower in the group treated with the head elevated than it was in the group treated with the head in neutral (difference between the two groups, 4.53 mm Hg [95% confidence interval, 1.29 to 7.79 mm Hg]). No patient sustained visual loss or any cervical-spine-related complications.Head elevation for adult lumbar spine fusion performed with the patient prone resulted in significantly lower IOP measurements than those seen when the operation was done with the patient's head in neutral. As lower IOP correlates with increased optic nerve perfusion, this intervention could mitigate the risk of perioperative blindness after spine surgery done with the patient prone.",1

For this reason, several highly accurate computer-assisted systems were developed and are currently on the market. However, these devices have certain disadvantages. We have developed a method of pedicle screw placement in the lumbar and sacral region using a multi-level drill guide template, created with the rapid prototyping technology and have validated it in a clinical study. The aim of the study was to manufacture and evaluate the accuracy of a multi-level drill guide template for lumbar and first sacral pedicle screw placement and to compare it with the free-hand technique under fluoroscopy supervision. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2011 and 2012, a randomized clinical trial was performed on 20 patients. 54 screws were implanted in the trial group using templates and 54 in the control group using the fluoroscopy-supervised free-hand technique. Furthermore, applicability for the first sacral level was tested. Preoperative CT-scans were taken and templates were designed using the selective laser sintering method. Postoperative evaluation and statistical analysis of pedicle violation, displacement, screw length and deviation were performed for both groups. RESULTS: The incidence of cortex perforation was significantly reduced in the template group; likewise, the deviation and displacement level of screws in the sagittal plane. In both groups there was no significantly important difference in deviation and displacement level in the transversal plane as not in pedicle screw length. The results for the first sacral level resembled the main investigated group. CONCLUSIONS: The method significantly lowers the incidence of cortex perforation and is therefore potentially applicable in clinical practice, especially in some selected cases. The applied method, however, carries a potential for errors during manufacturing and practical usage and therefore still requires further improvements.",1

Local group received 0.33 % ropivacaine by pump through the wound, and intravenous group received flurbiprofen axetil, pentazocine and palonosetron via intravenous pump. We evaluated the level of pain, the incidence of adverse reactions at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after operation, and the occurrence of chronic pain 3 months later.There were no significant differences in the pain level between the two groups. However, the incidence of nausea, vomiting and chronic pain was significantly lower in the local group.Our results showed that local infusion of ropivacaine achieved similar analgesic effects to intravenous delivery of analgesic drugs, but significantly reduced incidence of nausea, vomiting and chronic pain.",1

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of limaprost in the symptoms in patients with LSS. However, the evidence for effect on patient-reported outcomes, such as patient's HRQOL or satisfaction, is limited.This study was conducted at 4 study sites in Japan. Briefly, inclusion criteria were: age between 50 and 85 years; presence of both neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC) and cauda equina symptoms (at least presence of bilateral numbness in the lower limbs); and MRI-confirmed central stenosis with acquired degenerative LSS. Limaprost (15 microg/d) or etodolac (400 mg/d) was administered for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was Short Form (SF)-36, and the secondary outcomes were the verbal rating scale of low back pain and leg numbness, walking distance, subjective improvement, and satisfaction.A total of 79 participants were randomized (limaprost:etodolac = 39:40). Thirteen participants withdrew from the study (limaprost:etodolac = 5:8) and 66 completed the study (limaprost:etodolac = 34:32). Comparisons showed that limaprost resulted in significantly greater improvements in the SF-36 subscales of physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, vitality, and mental health. Limaprost was also significantly better than etodolac for leg numbness, NIC distance, and subjective improvement and satisfaction. In the subgroup analysis stratified by symptom severity, limaprost seemed more effective for milder symptoms. No serious adverse effects were reported in either treatment group.In this study, limaprost was found to be efficacious on most outcome measures, such as HRQOL, symptoms and subjective satisfaction, in LSS patents with cauda equina symptoms.",1

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this prospective randomized clinical trial was to compare low (0.5 ?g/kg/h) and high (2.5 ?g/kg/h) dose naloxone infusion on the time to tolerate liquids and meals after surgery, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) opioid requirements, nausea and pruritus ratings, and hospital length of stay. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Adolescents undergoing posterior spinal fusion often receive PCA after surgery and may experience common opioid-associated side effects, including nausea and pruritus. Low-dose naloxone infusion has been shown to reduce the incidence of pruritus and nausea while preserving analgesia, although an ideal dose has not been determined. Less is known about the potential for naloxone to improve bowel function after surgery. METHODS: Eighty-four patients (age 10-21 years) were randomly allocated to receive low- or high-dose naloxone infusion postoperatively. Surgical anesthetic consisted of propofol and opioid infusion with intrathecal morphine (10-15 ?g/kg) at the conclusion of surgery. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to rate nausea and pruritus. RESULTS: The groups had similar time to oral liquid intake after surgery and transition from PCA to oral pain medication. The VAS scores for pruritus and nausea were also similar, as was the need to treat these side effects. Morphine equivalents were similar between groups on postoperative day (POD) 0 and 1. On POD 2, the high-dose infusion group had significantly greater PCA bolus use (1.41±0.9 vs. 1.04±0.6; p<.05), although pain scores did not differ significantly. Hospital length of stay was similar for the two groups. CONCLUSION: High-dose naloxone infusion was associated with similar rates of opioid side effects as low-dose. Increased PCA use noted on POD 2 may represent partial reversal of opioid analgesia in the high-dose naloxone group. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 1.",1

METHODS: This study included 108 patients undergoing index lumbar discectomy. Patients were randomized immediately following surgery. Outcomes included back and leg visual analog pain scales (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and reherniation rates at 2-weeks, 6-weeks, 3-months, and 1-year following surgery. Differences in reherniation rates were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. VAS and ODI scores were evaluated using Student's t test. RESULTS: Six patients (11%) in the 2-week restriction group had a reherniation event and four patients (7%) in the 6-week restriction group experienced a reherniation (p = 0.52). VAS back pain (p < 0.001), leg pain (p < 0.001), and ODI scores (p < 0.001) were significantly improved for both cohorts as compared to baseline at the 2-week time point and remained significantly improved through 1-year [VAS back (p < 0.001); VAS leg (p < 0.001); ODI (p < 0.001)]. No significant differences in ODI, VAS back, or VAS leg scores were detected at any of the time points between the 2- and 6-week restriction groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this randomized trial suggest equivalent clinical outcomes irrespective of the length of post-operative restriction. From a clinical perspective, if patients are deemed at low risk for a reherniation event they may be confidence that early return to activity at 2 weeks will not compromise outcomes and may not adversely impact the risk of reherniation.

A recent trial found no significant difference between posterolateral and circumferential fusion reporting cost-effectiveness from a 2-year viewpoint.A total of 146 patients were randomized to posterolateral or circumferential fusion and followed 4 to 8 years after surgery. The mean age of the cohort was 46 years (range, 20-65 years); 61% were females, 49% were smokers, 30% had primary diagnosis of isthmic spondylolisthesis, 35% had disc degeneration and no previous surgery, and 35% had disc degeneration and previous surgery. Eighty-two percent of patients have had symptoms for more than 2 years and 50% were out of the labor market due to sickness. The EQ-5D instrument was applied for the measurement of health-related quality of life and costs (2004 U.S. dollars) were measured in a full-scale societal perspective. Productivity costs were valued by the Friction Cost method, and both costs and effects were discounted. Arithmetic means and 95% bias-corrected, bootstrapped confidence intervals were reported. Nonparametric statistics were used for tests of statistical significance. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis was conducted and reported using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.The circumferential group demonstrated clinical superiority over the posterolateral fusion group in functional outcome (P < 0.01), fusion rate (P < 0.04), and number of reoperations (P < 0.01) among others. Cost-utility analysis demonstrated circumferential fusion dominant over posterolateral fusion, that is, for each QALY gained performing circumferential fusion, the incremental saving was estimated at U.S. $49,306 (95% confidence interval, $27,183-$2,735,712). Results proved to be strong to various sensitivity analyses; only a differentiated underestimation of patients' need for postoperative household help against the circumferential approach could alter the dominance; however, still the probability of cost-effectiveness was >0.85 given a threshold for willingness to pay of U.S. $50,000 per QALY.Circumferential fusion is dominant over instrumented posterolateral fusion, that is, both being significantly cheaper and significantly better in a long-term, societal perspective.",1

Selected patients may benefit from stabilizing the fracture with cement through BKP, a minimally invasive procedure. BKP has been reported to give good short-time clinical results, and economic modeling has suggested that the procedure could be cost-effective after 2 years compared with standard treatment.Hospitalized patients with back pain due to VCF were randomized to BKP or to control using a computer-generated random list. All costs associated with VCF and cost-effectiveness were reported primarily from the perspective of society. We used EQ-5D to assess quality of life (QoL). The accumulated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs/QALY gained were assessed using intention to treat.Between February 2003 and December 2005, a total of 63 out of 67 Swedish patients were analyzed: BKP (n = 32) and control (n = 31). Societal cost per patient for BKP was SEK 160,017 (SD = 151,083) = €16,668 (SD = 15,735), and for control SEK 84,816 (SD = 40,954) = €8835 (SD = 4266), a significant difference of 75,198 (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 16,037-120,104) = €7833 (95% CI = 1671-12,511). The accumulated difference in QALYs was 0.085 (95% CI = -0.132 to 0.306) in favor of BKP. Cost/QALY gained using BKP was SEK 884,682 = €92,154 and US $134,043.In this randomized controlled trial, it was not possible to demonstrate that BKP was cost-effective compared with standard medical treatment in patients treated for an acute/subacute vertebral fracture due to osteoporosis. However, sensitivity analysis indicated a certain degree of uncertainty, which needs to be considered.",1

Primary outcomes were the neck disability index, cervical and UE pain visual analog scales (VAS), and patient-perceived global rating of change assessed at 3-, 6-, and 52-weeks. Secondary measures included treatment success rates and post-treatment healthcare utilization.The MTE group demonstrated significantly larger reductions in short- and long-term neck disability index scores (mean 1-year difference -5.1, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -8.1 to -2.1; P = 0.001) and short-term cervical VAS scores (mean 6-week difference -14.2, 95% CI -22.7 to -5.6; P = 0.001) as compared to the MIN group. The MTE group also demonstrated significant within group reductions in short- and long-term UE VAS scores at all time periods (mean 1-year difference -16.3, 95% CI -23.1 to -9.5; P = 0.000).

Self-completed questionnaires were administered before surgery and at intervals thereafter.To compare the clinical outcome of lumbar spinal fusion carried out using either allograft or autograft bone.Previous studies have suggested that allograft bone is effective in cervical and thoracic fusion operations but that it is less effective in lumbar spinal fusions. Most of these studies used a radiographic means of determining fusion. However, no reliable radiologic assessment method has yet been agreed upon. It has also been shown that radiographic appearance does not correlate with clinical outcome.A total of 69 patients undergoing instrumented posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion surgery were randomized to receive either allograft bone from the North East of Scotland Blood Transfusion Service or autologous bone from the iliac crest. The patients were then followed up at 1-year intervals over 6 years regarding clinical outcome.Patients receiving allograft bone had outcome scores similar to those who had received their own bone, except that in the autograft group there was a significant incidence of donor site pain that was persistent in about one sixth of patients.Allograft bone, in the form of fresh-frozen human femoral head, gives clinical results at least as good as autograft bone in instrumented posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion and completely avoids any donor site complications.",1

The generalizability of the CPR requires further investigation.A total of 112 patients were enrolled in the trial and provided demographic information and completed a number of self-report questionnaires including the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) and the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) at baseline, 1-week, 4-weeks, and 6-months. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 of the 3 manual therapy techniques for 2 consecutive treatment sessions followed by exercise regimen for an additional 3 sessions. We examined the primary aim using a linear mixed model for repeated measures, using the ODQ and NPRS as dependent variables. The hypothesis of interest was the group by time interaction, which was further explored with pair-wise comparisons of the estimated marginal means.There was a significant group x time interaction for the ODQ (P < 0.001) and NPRS scores (P = 0.001). Pair-wise comparisons revealed no differences between the supine thrust manipulation and side-lying thrust manipulation at any follow-up period. Significant differences in the ODQ and NPRS existed at each follow-up between the thrust manipulation and the nonthrust manipulation groups at 1-week and 4-weeks. There was also a significant difference in ODQ scores at 6-months in favor of the thrust groups.The results of the study support the generalizability of the CPR to another thrust manipulation technique, but not to the nonthrust manipulation technique that was used in this study. In general, our results also provided support that the CPR can be generalized to different settings from which it was derived and validated. However, additional research is needed to examine this issue.",1

To date, no studies have compared the effectiveness of spinal manipulation and functional technique for the management of this population.This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of spinal manipulation and functional technique on pain, disability, kinesiophobia, and quality of life in patients with chronic LBP.A single-blind pragmatic randomized controlled trial conducted in a university research clinic was carried out.Sixty-two patients (62% female, age: 45±7) with chronic LBP comprised the patient sample.Data on disability (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire [RMQ], Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index [ODI]), pain intensity (Numerical Pain Rate Scale [NPRS]), fear of movement (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia [TSK]), quality of life (Short Form-36 [SF-36] quality of life questionnaire), isometric resistance of abdominal muscles (McQuade test), and spinal mobility in flexion (finger-to-floor distance) were collected at baseline immediately after the intervention phase and at 1 month postintervention by an assessor blinded to group allocation of the patients.Patients were randomly assigned to the spinal manipulative therapy group or the functional technique group and received three once-weekly sessions.In comparison to patients receiving functional technique, those receiving spinal manipulation experienced statistically, although not clinically, significant greater reductions in terms of RMQ (standardized mean difference in score changes between groups at post-treatment: 0.1; at 1 month: 0.1) and ODI (post-treatment: 2.9; at 1 month: 1.4). Linear longitudinal analysis showed a significant improvement in both groups over time for RMQ (manipulative: F=68.51, p<.001; functional: F=28.58, p<.001) and ODI (manipulative: F=104.66, p<.001; functional: F=32.15, p=.001).

Differences between and within groups were not clinically meaningful in any of the reported measures.In comparison to functional technique, spinal manipulative therapy showed greater reduction in disability in patients with chronic LBP, but not in terms of pain, fear of movement, quality of life, isometric resistance of trunk flexors, or spinal mobility. However, differences in disability were not clinically meaningful; therefore, spinal manipulative therapy did not result in any clinically important short-term benefits over functional technique therapy. In addition, as neither group met the threshold for minimum clinically important difference following treatment, neither treatment resulted in a clinically meaningful benefit.",1

For evaluation of group homogeneity, a visual analog scale pain score and neurologic findings were measured preoperatively and postoperatively. Temperatures during bony decompression were measured using a forward-looking infrared camera system.Clinical results among the 3 groups did not differ in pain reduction, improvement of neurologic findings, or the rate of complications. However, significantly lower values were found for absolute and mean maximal temperatures during bony decompression in the USBCD group compared with the groups of patients who received the high-speed drill with automatic irrigation and the high-speed drill with manual irrigation, indicating this technique to be less aggressive in terms of thermal induction of bone necrosis. USBCD allows more precise bone removal compared with high-speed drills, and despite increased device time, no significant difference in the overall decompression time was observed.All methods examined produced short temperature peaks with possible, at least temporary, damage to bone and neural tissue. Automatic irrigation was associated with lower heat development compared with manual irrigation. Despite evidence of critical temperatures, no clinical correlation (e.g., neurologic deficits) was encountered in this study. Clinically, all 3 methods presented equally good results.",1

This procedure is performed with, or without fusion promoting methods. For both options the rate of fusion is high and there is much debate whether fusion of the treated segment is a contributing factor to accelerated degeneration of adjacent motion segments. In an effort to prevent degeneration of adjacent segments (ASDeg) due to loss of mobility at the operated level, cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) was introduced. To evaluate the effectiveness of CDA in preventing ASDeg long term studies are necessary. However, prevention of ASDeg is based on the premise that mobile disc prostheses preserve cervical spine motion in a physiological way. In this article the authors describe a short term protocol for a study that aims to investigate whether CDA reaches the intended goal: restoration or preservation of physiological cervical spine motion. To this end, a technique is used to establish the sequence of contributions of cervical motion segments to flexion/extension of the spine.24 subjects between 18 and 55 years old, with radicular symptoms due to a herniated disc between C5 and C7, refractory to conservative therapy are randomized to simple discectomy, or CDA. These groups are preceded by a pilot group of three subjects receiving CDA. Fluoroscopic flexion-extension recordings are acquired preoperatively, and at three and 12 months postoperative. At these same time points, patient reported outcomes are collected, and a neurological examination is performed by and independent physician.Studies investigating arthroplasty determine mobility by measuring segmental range of motion (sROM), which gives no information other than presence, and quantity, of mobility. SROM suffer from high variability. The authors therefore chose to use a method previously used in healthy controls, to describe the dynamic process of cervical spine motion in more detail. Determining cervical spine motion patterns has been reported to be more consistent than sROM. If a physiological motion pattern is absent after surgery in the CDA group, prevention of future ASDeg is less likely. Radiological outcomes will be correlated to clinical outcomes.NCT00868335.",1

The primary outcome variables are low back pain intensity, disability, and complete remission. The secondary outcome is participants' perception of improvement in low back symptoms.Of the 681 patients, 610 (89.6%) were followed through 18 months. Among participants not assigned to receive physical therapy or modalities, the estimated improvements in pain and disability and 18-month risk of complete remission were a little greater in the chiropractic group than in the medical group (adjusted RR of remission = 1.29; 95% CI = 0.80-2.07). Among participants assigned to medical care, mean changes in pain and disability and risk of remission were larger in patients assigned to receive physical therapy (adjusted RR = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.08-2.66). Among those assigned to chiropractic care, however, assignment to methods was not associated with improvement or remission (adjusted RR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.62-1.55). Compared with medical care only patients, chiropractic and physical therapy patients were much more likely to perceive improvement in their low back symptoms. However, less than 20% of all patients were pain-free at 18 months.Differences in outcomes between medical and chiropractic care without physical therapy or modalities are not clinically meaningful, although chiropractic may result in a greater likelihood of perceived improvement, perhaps reflecting satisfaction or lack of blinding. Physical therapy may be more effective than medical care alone for some patients, while physical modalities appear to have no benefit in chiropractic care.",1

Others have proposed methods for subgrouping patients as a means for determining the treatment most likely to benefit patients with particular characteristics.Patients with low back pain of less than 90 days' duration referred to physical therapy were examined before treatment and classified into one of three subgroups based on the type of treatment believed most likely to benefit the patient (manipulation, stabilization exercise, or specific exercise). Patients were randomly assigned to receive manipulation, stabilization exercises, or specific exercise treatment during a 4-week treatment period. Disability was assessed in the short-term (4 weeks) and long-term (1 year) using the Oswestry. Comparisons were made between patients receiving treatment matched to their subgroup, versus those receiving unmatched treatment.A total of 123 patients participated (mean age, 37.7 +/- 10.7 years; 45% female). Patients receiving matched treatments experienced greater short- and long-term reductions in disability than those receiving unmatched treatments. After 4 weeks, the difference favoring the matched treatment group was 6.6 Oswestry points (95% CI, 0.70-12.5), and at long-term follow-up the difference was 8.3 points (95% CI, 2.5-14.1). Compliers-only analysis of long-term outcomes yielded a similar result.Nonspecific low back pain should not be viewed as a homogenous condition. Outcomes can be improved when subgrouping is used to guide treatment decision-making.",1

However, individual characteristics may affect TE. No prior studies have evaluated TE modifiers in IDH.IDH patients underwent either discectomy (n = 788) or nonoperative care (n = 404) and were analyzed according to treatment received. Thirty-seven baseline variables were used to define subgroups for calculating the time-weighted average TE for the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) across 4 years (TE = ΔODI(surgery) -ΔODI(nonoperative)). Variables with significant subgroup-by-treatment interactions (P < 0.1) were simultaneously entered into a multivariate model to select independent TE predictors.All analyzed subgroups improved significantly more with surgery than with nonoperative treatment (P < 0.05). In minimally adjusted univariate analyses, being married, absence of joint problems, worsening symptom trend at baseline, high school education or less, older age, no worker's compensation, longer duration of symptoms, and an SF-36 mental component score (MCS) less than 35 were associated with greater TEs. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that being married (TE, -15.8 vs. -7.7 single, P < 0.001), absence of joint problems (TE, -14.6 vs. -10.3 joint problems, P = 0.012), and worsening symptoms (TE, -15.9 vs. -11.8 stable symptoms, P = 0.032) were independent TE modifiers. TEs were greatest in married patients with worsening symptoms (-18.3) vs. single patients with stable symptoms (-7.8).IDH patients who met strict inclusion criteria improved more with surgery than with nonoperative treatment, regardless of specific characteristics. However, being married, without joint problems, and worsening symptom trend at baseline were associated with a greater TE.",1

The evidence for the relative benefit of these treatments is limited, and questions concerning the most appropriate type of intervention remain unanswered.Eighty patients with chronic low back pain (>3 months) were randomized to one of the following treatments, involving 8 treatments over 8 weeks; 1) one-to-one treatment involving 30 minutes of manual therapy (mobilizations to the spine) and spinal stabilization exercises, and 2) a 10 station exercise class involving aerobic exercises, spinal stabilization exercises, and manual therapy. Three physiotherapists led the hour long group with a maximum of 10 patients. Questionnaires were completed, and physical measurements were taken by a blinded observer before randomization, at the completion of treatment, and at 6 months and 12 months after the completion of treatment. The intention-to-treat principle was used in data analysis.Eleven patients dropped out of the individual treatment sessions and 7 dropped out of the exercise group. There was a significant reduction (reduced disability) in the questionnaire score in both groups, and there were significant increases in range for all the physical movements tested in both groups. The exercise group was 40% more cost effective than the individual treatments.Both forms of intervention were associated with significant improvement. On-going clinical research is necessary to provide guidance as to the clinical efficacy of various forms of intervention.",1

They have been used in the epidural space and around nerve roots and have been used as an alternative to chymopapain within the disc. Previous studies have, however, shown variable results.A total of 120 patients with chronic low back pain of discogenic origin were enrolled in the study. At discography, if they had concordant pain, they were randomized to injection of normal saline or methylprednisolone into the disc space. These patients were prospectively followed up for 12 months, and they were asked to report pain according to a visual analogue score and their Oswestry Disability Index was recorded. The primary outcome measure was determined as a percentage change in disability, and the results were analyzed using independent samples t test. The secondary outcome measure was a change in the pain score, and this was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test.There was no significant difference in the primary outcome between the two groups (P = 0.71). The steroid group had a mean change of 2.28 (SE 2.49) in percentage disability, while the saline group had a mean change of 3.42 (SE 1.79). With respect to the change in pain score, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.72). Those patients who had saline injection had a median change in pain score of 0 (interquartile range -1 to 1), whereas those given steroid treatment had a median change in pain score of 0 (interquartile range -0.25 to 1).This study demonstrates that intradiscal steroid injections do not improve the clinical outcome in patients with discogenic back pain compared with placebo.",1

Previous reports have mainly focused on various semiconstrained devices and only a few publications have focused on ossification around devices that are nonconstrained. The purpose of this study was to assess the occurrence of heterotopic ossification around a nonconstrained cervical device and how it affects clinical outcome 2 years after surgery.Thirty-seven patients were included from a larger cohort of a randomized controlled trial (NORCAT) which compared single-level cervical arthroplasty with fusion. The occurrence of heterotopic ossification was assessed with a CT scan and two neuroradiologists determined its degree. For grading, we used the Mehren/Suchomel classification system (grade 0-4). The patients were divided by level of ossification, low grade (0-2) or high grade (3-4), and clinical outcomes were compared. Self-rated disability for neck and arm pain (Neck Disability Index), health-related quality of life (the Short Form-36 and EuroQol-5D), and pain (the Numeric Rating Scale 11) were used as clinical outcome measures.Heterotopic ossification was encountered in all patients 2 years after surgery. Complete fusion (grade 4) was found in 16 % of participants, and high-grade ossification (grade 3-4) occurred in 62 %. The remaining patients were classified as having low-grade ossification (grade 2). There were no differences in the clinical outcomes of patients with low- and high-grade ossification.High-grade heterotopic ossification and spontaneous fusion 2 years after surgery were seen in a significant number of patients. However, the degree of ossification did not influence the clinical outcome.",1

Methods From February 2006 to February 2007, a total of 102 cases with cervical spondylotic myelopathy were assessed in this randomized controlled trial. Fifty-seven patients underwent EOLP with the hinge located at the inner margin of the lateral mass classified as wide-open group. Forty-five cases who underwent EOLP with the hinge positioned at the lamina margin served as narrow-open group. The clinical results and radiological examinations of both groups were evaluated 24 months after surgery. Results There were no significant differences in operation time,bleeding quantity and recovery rate of Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores. The incidence of C5 palsy and severity of axial symptoms in the wide-open group were significantly lower than those in the narrowopen group (P ＜ 0.05). There were no significant differences in cervical curvature index and range of motion between the two groups. Conclusions Well-suited and appropriated inwardly shift the hinge could promote clinical outcomes after EOLP, especially decrease the incidence of the C5 palsy and the severity of axial symptom, but it is contraindication for patients with ossification of posterior longitudinal ligment,ossification of ligment flavum and flurosis cervical stenosis.

The surgical group was treated with anterior cervical decompression and fusion. The physiotherapy program included general/specific exercises and pain-coping strategies. The outcome measures were disability (Neck Disability Index), neck and arm pain intensity (visual analogue scale), and the patient's global assessment. Patients were followed for 24 months.The result from the repeated-measures analysis of variance showed no significant between-group difference for Neck Disability Index (P = 0.23). For neck pain intensity, the repeated-measures analysis of variance showed a significant between-group difference during the study period in favor of the surgical group (P = 0.039). For arm pain intensity, no significant between-group differences were found according to the repeated-measures analysis of variance (P = 0.580). Eighty-seven percent of the patients in the surgical group rated their symptoms as ""better/much better"" at the 12-month follow-up compared with 62% in the nonsurgical group (P < 0.05). At 24 months, the corresponding figures were 81% and 69% (P = 0.28). The difference was significant only at the 12-month follow-up in favor of the surgical group. Significant reduction in Neck Disability Index, neck pain, and arm pain compared with baseline was seen in both groups (P < 0.001).In this prospective, randomized study of patients with cervical radiculopathy, it was shown that surgery with physiotherapy resulted in a more rapid improvement during the first postoperative year, with significantly greater improvement in neck pain and the patient's global assessment than physiotherapy alone, but the differences between the groups decreased after 2 years.

No previous prospective, randomized study of treatment effect modifiers relating to outcome of ACDF compared with physiotherapy has been carried out.60 patients with cervical radiculopathy were randomized to ACDF followed by physiotherapy or physiotherapy alone. Data for possible modifiers of treatment outcome at 1 year, such as sex, age, duration of pain, pain intensity, disability (Neck Disability Index, NDI), patient expectations of treatment, anxiety due to neck/arm pain, distress (Distress and Risk Assessment Method), self-efficacy (Self-Efficacy Scale) health status (EQ-5D), and magnetic resonance imaging findings were collected. A multivariate analysis was performed to find treatment effect modifiers affecting the outcome regarding arm/neck pain intensity and NDI.Factors that significantly altered the treatment effect between treatment groups in favor of surgery were: duration of neck pain less than 12 months (P = 0.007), duration of arm pain less than 12 months (P = 0.01) and female sex (P = 0.007) (outcome: arm pain), low EQ-5D index (outcome: neck pain, P = 0.02), high levels of anxiety due to neck/arm pain (outcome: neck pain, P = 0.02 and NDI, P = 0.02), low Self-Efficacy Scale score (P = 0.05), and high Distress and Risk Assessment Method score (P = 0.04) (outcome: NDI). No factors were found to be associated with better outcome with physiotherapy alone.In this prospective, randomized study of patients with cervical radiculopathy, short duration of pain, female sex, low health quality, high levels of anxiety due to neck/arm pain, low self-efficacy, and a high level of distress before treatment were associated with better outcome from surgery.

However, there is paucity of data whether semi-intensive outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation in groups is more effective than individual physiotherapy.A total of 120 women employed as healthcare and social care professionals with nonspecific chronic low back pain were recruited from two occupational healthcare centers. The patients were randomized into two intervention programs. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation (n = 59) was conducted in groups and comprised of physical training, workplace interventions, back school, relaxation training, and cognitive-behavioral stress management methods for 70 hours. The individual physiotherapy (n = 61) included physical exercise and passive treatment methods administered for 10 hours. Main outcome measures were: back pain and sciatic pain intensity, disability, sick leaves, healthcare consumption, symptoms of depression, and beliefs of working ability after 2 years.There were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups in main outcome measures just after rehabilitation, at 6-, at 12-, or 24-month follow-up. In both intervention arms, however, the before-and-after comparison showed favorable effects, and the effects were still maintained at 2 years follow-up.The results of this study indicate that semilight outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for female chronic low back pain patients does not offer incremental benefits when compared with rehabilitation carried out by a physiotherapist having a cognitive-behavioral way of administering the treatment.",1

Primary outcome was Roland Disability Questionnaire score 18 months from baseline; secondary measures were pain, health-related quality of life, and time off work. Healthcare costs associated with low back pain and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were also measured. RESULTS.: A total of 71 participants were assigned to usual outpatient physiotherapy, 72 to spinal stabilization, and 69 to physiotherapist-led pain management. A total of 160 (75%) provided follow-up data at 18 months, showing similar improvements with all interventions: mean (95% confidence intervals) Roland Disability Questionnaire score improved from 11.1 (9.6-12.6) to 6.9 (5.3-8.4) with usual outpatient physiotherapy, 12.8 (11.4-14.2) to 6.8 (4.9-8.6) with spinal stabilization, and 11.5 (9.8-13.1) to 6.5 (4.5-8.6) following pain management classes. Pain, quality of life, and time off work also improved within all groups with no between-group differences. Mean (SD) healthcare costs and QALY gain were pound474 (840) and 0.99 (0.27) for individual physiotherapy, pound379 (1040) and 0.90 (0.37) for spinal stabilization, and pound165 (202) and 1.00 (0.28) for pain management.For chronic low back pain, all three physiotherapy regimens improved disability and other relevant health outcomes, regardless of their content. Physiotherapist-led pain management classes offer a cost-effective alternative to usual outpatient physiotherapy and are associated with less healthcare use. A more widespread adoption of physiotherapist-led pain management could result in considerable cost savings for healthcare providers.",1

There is strong evidence for manual therapy in combination with exercises. Psychosocial factors are also believed to play a role in chronic pain. The evidence of the effectiveness of a program focused on these factors is still unknown.A randomized clinical trial was conducted, involving 146 patients with subacute nonspecific neck pain. The BGA program can be described as a time-contingent increase in activities from baseline toward predetermined goals. Manual therapy consists of specific spinal mobilization techniques and exercises. Primary outcomes were global perceived effect, the Numerical Rating Scale for pain and the Neck Disability Index. Secondary outcomes were the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, the 4 Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire, and the Pain Coping and Cognition List. Measurements were carried out at baseline and 6, 13, 26, and 52 weeks after randomization. Data are analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle, using multilevel analysis.The success rates at 52 weeks, based on the GPE were 89.4% for the BGA program and 86.5% for MT. This difference was not statistically significant. For pain and disability, a difference was found in favor of the BGA program; mean difference for pain = 0.99 (95% CI 0.15-1.83) and mean difference for NDI = 2.42 (95% CI 0.52-4.32). All other differences between the interventions in the primary and secondary outcomes were not statistically significant.Based on this trial it can be concluded that there are only marginal, but not clinically relevant, differences between a BGA program and MT.",1

Recent randomized control trials of disc arthroplasty devices have established a large cohort of patients treated with fusion and 2-year outcomes that allow analysis of prognostic factors.The patient cohort was the fusion control patients (n = 488) from 2 randomized controlled studies of disc replacements. Surgical indications were recalcitrant single-level subaxial radiculopathy or myelopathy. The surgery included anterior discectomy and fusion with allograft and plate. Patients were assessed by neck and arm pain, neck disability index (NDI), SF-36, neurologic examination, and return to work. Overall clinical success was defined based on meeting all 4 of these criteria: >15-point improvement in NDI; maintained or improved neurologic examination; no serious adverse event related to the procedure; and no revision of the plate or graft. Patient's outcomes were recorded, at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, with 77% follow-up at 24 months.The outcome variables for this analysis were overall clinical success and >15-point improvement in NDI. We studied the relationship between each of the outcome variables and 26 potential important variables including demographics, medical conditions, socioeconomic factors, and disease state. Two statistical models were used to explore the association between outcome variables and baseline measures: multivariate logistical regression of the full model with every prognostic variable included and the model with the variables selected by the stepwise selection procedure.In the full-model logistic analysis for overall success, worker's compensation and weak narcotic use were negative predictors while higher preoperative NDI score and normal sensory function were positive predictors. For NDI success, only the preoperative NDI scores (higher disability predictive of improvement) appeared to have strong influence on the outcome.In the stepwise regression model, preoperative normal sensory function was a positive predictor and worker's compensation a negative predictors of overall clinical success. Greater age, higher preoperative NDI score, and gainful employment were positive predictors and spinal litigation was a negative predictor of NDI success.We found that important predictors of outcome were work status, sensory function, involvement in litigation, and higher disability scores.",1

The implantation of a bioresorbable gel on the dura may further decrease the amount of scar formation after surgery and thus improve the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL). This study is a 12-month evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of Oxiplex/SP Gel (FzioMed, Inc., San Luis Obispo, CA) in the reduction of pain and radiculopathy after lumbar discectomy. Methods A pilot randomized single-blind multicenter clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the performance of Oxiplex/SP Gel in patients who underwent surgery for unilateral herniation of the lumbar disc at L4–5 or L5–S1. Eighteen patients with severe leg pain and lower-extremity weakness (11 women and seven men) were randomly assigned intraoperatively to receive the gel at the conclusion of surgery (treatment group) or to undergo surgery alone (control group). Self-assessment questionnaires (Lumbar Spine Outcomes Questionnaire) to assess pain, symptoms, and ADL were completed preoperatively and at scheduled postoperative intervals (30 days, 90 days, 6 months, and 12 months). The authors examined the spine and lower extremities of patients scheduled for discectomy to assess neurological function and pain. Treated patients received sufficient Oxiplex/SP Gel (1–3 ml) to coat the nerve root and fill the epidural space. Postoperative clinical evaluations were performed at 30 and 90 days. Patients completed the self-assessment questionnaires at baseline and were contacted by telephone or mail for the completion of the postoperative self-assessment questionnaires. Surgical procedures were well tolerated; no device-related adverse events and no clinically significant laboratory results were reported. The 11 patients with severe leg pain and lower-extremity weakness who were treated with Oxiplex/SP Gel had a reduction in those symptoms at 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, and 12 months after discectomy, compared with the seven control patients who underwent surgery only. Conclusions Oxiplex/SP Gel was easy to use and safe in patients who underwent unilateral discectomy. A greater benefit in clinical outcome measures was seen over the 12-month follow-up period in gel-treated patients.",1

In this trial, we examined the hypothesis that a continuous thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) administered through a catheter inserted into the anterior region of the TPVS allows a wider sensory block dispersion. Fifty consecutive patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery were enrolled. Before the surgery, an infusion catheter was inserted into the TPVS through a needle placed adjacent to either the parietal pleura (group A) or internal intercostal membrane (group P) using an ultrasound-guided intercostal transverse approach according to a randomized allocation schedule. A chest radiograph was obtained postoperatively after injection of 10 mL of radiopaque dye through the catheter. Thereafter, 20 mL of 0.375% levobupivacaine was injected via the catheter, followed by commencement of continuous TPVB with 0.25% levobupivacaine at 8 mL/h. The primary outcome was the number of blocked dermatomes at 24 h after surgery. The secondary outcomes included radiopaque dye spreading patterns, the number of segments reached by the radiopaque dye, the number of blocked dermatomes at 2 h after surgery, and pain scores. The median (interquartile range [range]) number of blocked dermatomes 24 h after surgery was 3 (2.75–4 [1–6]) in group A (n = 22) and 2 (1.5–3 [0–7]) in group P (n = 25; p = 0.037). No significant differences in the other outcomes were found between the groups. In conclusion, a continuous TPVB administered using a catheter supposedly inserted into the anterior region of the TPVS allows a wider sensory block dispersion than a catheter inserted into the posterior region of the TPVS.

Urodynamic examination was also performed for patients in the UCMSC group and the rehabilitation therapy group.Seven of the ten patients in the UCMSC group had significant and stable improvement in movement, self-care ability, and muscular tension; five of the forteen patients (36%) in the rehabilitation group also had certain improvement in these aspects. Urodynamic examination demonstrated that patients in the UCMSC group exhibited an increase in maximum urinary flow rate and maximum bladder capacity, as well as a decrease in residue urine volume and maximum detrusor pressure. The rehabilitation group exhibited decreased maximum bladder capacity, but no perceptible change in maximum urinary flow rate, residue urine volume or maximum detrusor pressure.UCMSC transplantation can effectively improve neurological functional recovery after spinal cord injury, and its efficacy is superior to that of rehabilitation therapy and self-healing.The present clinical study was registered at chictr.org (registration number: NCT01393977).",1

We theorized that shifting the target of RF coagulation to the facet joint capsule would provide an easier target and a longer-lived pain relieving response.A prospective randomized controlled trial where 120 patients diagnosed with CLBP of a confirmed facet origin were randomly divided into three equal groups, the first was submitted to percutaneous radiofrequency coagulation of the facet joint capsule, the second underwent percuataneous denervation of the medial dorsal branch and the third did not receive radiofrequency lesioning. All the three groups received local injection of a mixture of local anesthetic and steroid. Cases were followed for up to 3 years.87(72.5%) patients were females. By 3 months' post procedure, improvement in VAS was significantly better than pretreatment levels in all groups (p<0.05). The control group lost improvement by 1-year follow-up (p=0.017). At 2 years' follow-up, the joint capsule denervation group maintained significant improvement (p=0.033) whereas the medial branch denervation group lost its significant effect (p=0.479). By the end of follow-up period, only joint capsule denervation group kept significant improvement (p=0.026).In CLBP of facet origin, shifting the target of percutaneous radiofrequency to the facet joint capsule provides an easier technique with an extended period of pain relief compared to the medial dorsal branch of the facet joint.",1

This study compared the effect of plasmalyte to 0.9% saline on coagulation assessed by rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and acid-base balance in the aforementioned patients.Fifty patients were randomly allocated to receive either 0.9% saline or plasmalyte during operation and until postoperative 12 h. ROTEM was performed at 10 min after anesthetic induction and end of surgery. Arterial blood gas analyses were serially performed from 10 min after anesthetic induction until postoperative 12 h. Fluid balance, blood loss, and transfusion requirement were assessed.ROTEM variables showed sporadic deterioration in both groups after surgery without intergroup differences. Intraoperatively, arterial pH, base excess, and bicarbonate concentrations were lower and serum chloride concentrations were higher in the 0.9% saline group compared with the plasmalyte group. The differences in base excess and bicarbonate concentrations persisted until postoperative 12 h. Fluid balance, blood loss, and transfusion requirement were similar between the groups while urine output was greater in the plasmalyte group compared with the 0.9% saline group (3.2 ± 1.6 ml/kg/h vs. 1.8 ± 1.1 ml/kg/h, p = 0.001).In contrast to plasmalyte, fluid therapy with 0.9% saline resulted in transient hyperchloremic acidosis in patients undergoing multi-level lumbar spinal fusion, while coagulation assessed by ROTEM analysis and the amount of blood loss were similar between the groups.",1

While the optimal treatment of aged patients with acute OVCFs remains controversial, PVP, a minimally invasive procedure, is a treatment option to be considered.Patients aged at 70 years or above with acute OVCF and severe pain from minor or mild trauma were assigned randomly to PVP and CV groups. The primary outcome was pain relief as measured by VAS score in 1-year follow-up period. The second outcome was quality of life assessed with ODI and Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO). Patient satisfaction surveys were also recorded.A total of 135 patients were enrolled, and 107 (56 in PVP group; 51 in CV group) completed 1-year follow-up. In PVP group, the vertebroplasty procedure was performed at a mean of 8.4 ± 4.6 days (range, 2-21 days) after onset. Vertebroplasty resulted in much greater pain relief than did conservative treatment at postoperative day 1 (P < 0.0001). At every time point of follow-up, pain relief and quality of life were significantly improved in PVP group than in CV group at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year (all P < 0.0001). The final follow-up surveys indicated that patients in PVP group were significantly more satisfied with given treatment (P < 0.0001). In addition, lower rate of complications was observed in PVP group (P < 0.0001).In aged patients with acute OVCF and severe pain, early vertebroplasty yielded faster, better pain relief and improved functional outcomes, which were maintained for 1 year. Furthermore, it showed fewer complications than conservative treatment.2.",1

Despite encouraging initial reports, outstanding issues include the need for evidence regarding safety and efficacy in an older population; and an assessment of cost-effectiveness.Patients over 60 years old were randomized to rhBMP-2/ACS (n = 50) or ICBG (n = 52). Oswestry Disability Index, Short Form-36, and numerical rating scales for back and leg pain were determined preoperatively and at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Fusion was evaluated by fine-cut computed tomography scan 2 years postoperatively by 3 reviewers. All in-patient and subsequent out-patient event costs were recorded by a dedicated hospital coder.Two-year postoperative improvement in Oswestry Disability Index averaged 15.8 in the rhBMP-2/ACS group and 13.0 in the ICBG group. Mean improvement in Short Form-36 physical component score was 6.6 in the rhBMP-2/ACS group and 7.5 in the ICBG group. There were 20 complications in the ICBG group and 8 complications in the rhBMP-2/ACS group (P = 0.014). Sixteen ICBG and 10 rhBMP-2/ACS patients required additional treatment for persistent back or leg symptoms. Two rhBMP-2/ACS patients had revision procedures, 1 for nonunion. Eight patients in the ICBG group had revision procedures, 5 for nonunion. Mean fusion grade on computed tomography scan was significantly (P = 0.030) better in the rhBMP-2/ACS (4.3) compared with the ICBG group (3.8). Mean cost of the initial admission was $36,530 in the rhBMP-2/ACS group and $34,235 in the iliac crest bone graft (ICBG) group. Total cost of care over 2 years was $42,574 for the ICBG group and $40,131 for the rhBMP-2/ACS group.RhBMP-2/ACS is a viable ICBG replacement in older patients in terms of safety, clinical efficacy, and cost-effectiveness.",1

Although earlier biomechanical works have evaluated the effectiveness of different odontoid screw fixation techniques, no study has quantified the mechanical stability of odontoid fixation by a plate device.The second cervical vertebra was removed from 15 fresh human spinal columns. The specimens were fixed to the experimental apparatus with the load cell at the articular surface of the odontoid process. In the first test series, stiffness and failure load of the intact odontoid were measured. Type II odontoid fractures were created by a 45 degree oblique extension loading at the articular surface of the odontoid process. Afterward, the specimens were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 3 groups: in group I (n=5), the fractures were stabilized, using a specially designed plate construct, in group II, the fractures were fixed, using two 3.5 mm cortical screws, and in group III, we used 1 regular 4.5 mm cortical screw. In the second test series, stiffness and failure load of the stabilized odontoid fractures were assessed for comparison and statistical analysis.Group I (plate device) showed a significantly higher mean failure load than group II and group III. The mean failure load of group I, after fixation of the odontoid fracture, was 84% of the mean failure load that was necessary to create a type II odontoid fracture initially. Comparing group II (double screw technique) and group III (single screw technique), there was no significant difference regarding the mean failure load. In both groups, the mean failure load after odontoid fixation was approximately 50% of the mean failure load of the intact odontoid. Statistical analysis also revealed a significantly higher stiffness of the stabilized odontoid after plate fixation than after single- or double-screw fixation.Plate fixation of the odontoid process for certain type II odontoid fracture patterns provided a significantly higher biomechanical stability than the technique of odontoid screw fixation. Using a specially designed plate construct fixed with 2 cancellous screws into the body of C2 and an additional cortical screw inserted in the odontoid process, 84% of the original stability of the intact odontoid was restored. Single- or double-screw fixation of the odontoid only restored approximately 50% of the original strength.",1

The results for surgery are conflicting. Cohort studies have shown excellent results for active treatment modalities in patients with sciatica.One hundred eighty-one consecutive patients with radicular pain below the knee were examined at the baseline, at 8 weeks, and at 1 year after the treatment. Participants were randomized into 2 groups: (1) symptom-guided exercises + information + advice to stay active and (2) sham exercises + information + advice to stay active. Symptom-guided exercises consisted of a variety of back-related exercises given in accordance with a written algorithm in which symptoms or response to exercises determined the exercises given (http://www.sygehuslillebaelt.dk/wm345075, click exercises). Sham exercises were optional, designed to increase general blood circulation, and had no targeted effect on the back. The information was comprehensive and included anatomy, pathogenesis, and how discs heal without surgery. The advice included encouragement to stay as active as possible but to reduce activity if leg pain increased. The use of medication was optional, but only paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were recommended.A mean of 4.8 treatment sessions were provided. All patients experienced statistically significant and clinically important improvements in global assessment, functional status, pain, vocational status, and clinical findings. The symptom-guided exercise group improved significantly more than the sham exercise group in most outcomes.Active conservative treatment was effective for patients who had symptoms and clinical findings that would normally qualify them for surgery. Although participating patients had greater faith in the sham exercises before treatment, the symptom-guided exercises were superior for most outcomes.",1

Bisphosphonates, which are used for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, may accentuate gasterointestinal complications and lead to more nonadherence to treatment. This randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare the effect of pamidronate versus alendronate on early bone mineral density changes in kidney transplant patients.Forty patients (27 men and 13 women), aged from 20 to 58 years, with low bone mineral density (T score < -2) in the spine, total hip, or femur neck were enrolled. Participants were randomly allocated into 2 groups to receive pamidronate or alendronate. The pamidronate group received intravenous pamidronate, 90 mg, starting from the 3rd week of transplantation for 3 months. The alendronate group started to receive oral alendronate, 70 mg per week for the same period. At baseline and 6 months, bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Gastrointestinal side effects were monitored every month.No significant difference was found in bone density changes of the lumber area between the two groups; however, significantly less reduction in bone mineral density of the femur neck and femur occurred in the pamidronate group. Kidney function and parathyroid hormone levels were similar in the two groups before and after the study. Gastrointestinal side effects were seen in 3 patients of the alendronate group only.Pamidronate was comparable to alendronate in prevention of early bone loss after kidney transplantation.",0

Three months postoperatively, they were randomized into an exercise group (n = 48) or usual care group (n = 50). The exercise group received 12-month progressive home-based training with regular booster sessions, and the usual care group a single session of physiotherapy instruction. Kinesiophobia was assessed with the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) and physical activity by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) preoperatively, 3 months after lumbar spine fusion, and at the end of the 12-month intervention.Before the intervention, the median (first quartile; third quartile) of TSK was 32.5 (29.0; 37.0) in the exercise group and 30.0 (25.8; 36.0) in the usual care group, changing to 30.0 (25; 36) in the exercise group and to 30.5 (24; 36.3) in the usual care group (between-group p = 0.17). IPAQ metabolic equivalent minutes per week increased from 1,863 (1,040; 3,042) to 3,190 (1,634; 6,485) in the exercise group and from 2,569 (1,501; 4,075) to 3,590 (1,634; 6,484) in the usual care group (between-group p = 0.92).Progressive 12-month home-exercise starting 3 months postoperatively was not superior to usual care in decreasing kinesiophobia or increasing physical activity in spondylolisthesis.",0

Several investigations have been conducted to compare the different medical managements for non-surgical cases. However, the role of the immobilization with a non-rigid cervical collar (nRCC) for pain management and range of motion (RoM) preservation has not been completely clarified. Methods We performed a systematic review of the randomized control trials (RCTs) and a pooled analysis in order to investigate the role of the nRCC for pain management, scored through the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the RoM, by comparing the use of a nRCC (for 1–2 weeks) with a non-immobilization protocols, regardless of the association with physical therapy (PhT). Only patients with whiplash-associated disorders grade I–II were included. Due to a certain heterogeneity across the RCTs, follow-up period time range resetting was necessary in order to pool the data.ResultsA total of 141 papers were reviewed; 6 of them matched the inclusion criteria and were admitted to the final study. Pooled analysis showed that nRCC does not improve the outcome in terms of VAS score and RoM trends along the follow-up. Moreover, VAS and RoM trends seem to further improve at long-term follow-up in non-immobilization associated with PhT group.ConclusionsThis pooled analysis of the available RCTs shows the absence of an advantage of the immobilization protocol with a nRCC after a WI. On the contrary, non-immobilization protocols show an overall better trend of pain relief and neck mobility recovery, regardless of the association of PhT.Graphic abstractThese slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

The authors examined the use of ultrasound imaging to reduce this difficulty. Methods The authors recruited 120 orthopedic patients with one of the following: body mass index more than 35 kg/m² and poorly palpable spinous processes; moderate to severe lumbar scoliosis; or previous lumbar spine surgery. Patients were randomized to receive spinal anesthetic by the conventional surface landmark-guided technique (group LM) or by an ultrasound-guided technique (group US). Patients in group US had a preprocedural ultrasound scan to locate and mark a suitable needle insertion point. The primary outcome was the rate of successful dural puncture on the first needle insertion attempt. Normally distributed data were summarized as mean ± SD and nonnormally distributed data were summarized as median [interquartile range]. Results The first-attempt success rate was twice as high in group US than in group LM (65% vs. 32%; P &amp;lt; 0.001). There was a twofold difference between groups in the number of needle insertion attempts (group US, 1 [1-2] vs. group LM, 2 [1-4]; P &amp;lt; 0.001) and number of needle passes (group US, 6 [1-10] vs. group LM, 13 [5-21]; P = 0.003). More time was required to establish landmarks in group US (6.7 ± 3.1; group LM, 0.6 ± 0.5 min; P &amp;lt; 0.001), but this was partially offset by a shorter spinal anesthesia performance time (group US, 5.0 ± 4.9 vs. group LM, 7.3 ± 7.6 min; P = 0.038). Similar results were seen in subgroup analyses of patients with body mass index more than 35 kg/m and patients with poorly palpable landmarks. Conclusion Preprocedural ultrasound imaging facilitates the performance of spinal anesthesia in the nonobstetric patient population with difficult anatomic landmarks.",0

In this study, we evaluated the effect of epidurally administered neostigmine on postoperative ileus after abdominal aortic surgery.We enrolled 45 patients who were scheduled for elective abdominal aortic surgery at our institution. All patients received identical general and epidural anesthesia. Before the induction of general anesthesia, an epidural catheter was placed at the T7-T8 intervertebral space, and 20 mL bupivacaine (0.5%) was injected over 15 min. Patients were randomized into two groups. Patients received a 5 mL bolus of neostigmine (1 microg/kg) diluted with normal saline (Group 1) or a 5 mL bolus of normal saline (Group 2) via an epidural catheter at the end of surgery and 8 h postoperatively. Times of bowel sounds were recorded postoperatively in the intensive care unit. Times of daily passage of flatus and defecation also were recorded.Times to the first bowel sounds and the first flatus were significantly shorter in Group 1 than they were in Group 2 (11.6 +/- 11.2 h vs 22.6 +/- 12.8 h and 21.8 +/- 15.6 h vs 36.6 +/- 19.1 h, respectively, P < 0.05). The times to first defecation were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). Nausea was more frequent in patients in Group 2 than in Group 1 (P < 0.05). The incidence of postoperative complications was similar between the groups (P > 0.05).Thoracic epidural neostigmine enables faster restoration of bowel sounds and shortens duration of postoperative ileus after abdominal aortic surgery.",0

Glucocorticoids, cyclosporine and pre-existing uremic osteodystrophy have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the skeletal lesions. Glucocorticoid induced osteopenia is also a serious clinical problem in patients with various nonrenal diseases and can be prevented, or at least attenuated, by pamidronate and other bisphosphonates.We prospectively studied 26 male patients undergoing renal transplantation, and randomized them to receive either placebo or intravenous pamidronate (0.5 mg/kg) at the time of transplantation and again one month later. All patients received immunosuppression comprising prednisolone, cyclosporine and azathioprine. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the second, third and fourth lumbar vertebrae and of the femoral neck was measured at the time of transplantation and at three months and 12 months after transplantation using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).Twelve months after transplantation, the mean (+/- SEM) BMD of the lumbar vertebrae in patients who received placebo had decreased 6.4% (P < 0.05). In contrast, patients who received pamidronate experienced no significant reduction of BMD at the lumbar vertebrae. At the femoral neck, placebo-treated patients showed a reduction of BMD of 9% (P < 0.005), whereas there was no significant change in the pamidronate treated group. The two study groups had similar patient profiles, serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and aluminium concentrations. After transplantation, comparable falls in the serum creatinine and PTH concentration were found in the two groups. Apart from transient hypocalcemia in two patients, no significant adverse effects of pamidronate were noted.This study has shown that the early rapid bone loss that occurs in men during the first 12 months after renal transplantation can be prevented by two intravenous doses of pamidronate given at transplantation and one month later. The regimen was simple to administer, well tolerated and potentially applicable to other clinical groups of glucocorticoid treatment patients.",0

Changes in five biochemical markers, obtained from a subset of women enrolled in the Fracture Prevention Trial, were examined. Early increases in the PICP and the PINP were the best predictors of BMD response to teriparatide in this analysis.Early reductions in biochemical markers of bone turnover with antiresorptive therapy negatively correlate with subsequent increases in BMD. We undertook this analysis to determine if early changes in biochemical markers with teriparatide therapy predict subsequent increases in BMD.In the Fracture Prevention Trial, 1637 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were randomized to receive daily, self-administered, subcutaneous injections of placebo, teriparatide 20 microg/day, or teriparatide 40 microg/day. Serum concentrations of two bone formation markers (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [bone ALP] and the carboxy-terminal extension peptide of procollagen type 1 [PICP]) and urinary concentrations of two bone resorption markers (free deoxypyridinoline [DPD] and N-terminal telopeptide [NTX]) were assessed in a trial population subset (n = 520) at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. We also assessed serum concentrations of another bone formation marker, the amino-terminal extension peptide of procollagen type 1 (PINP), in a subset of 771 women at baseline and 3 months. Lumbar spine (LS) BMD was measured by DXA at baseline and 18 months. Femoral neck BMD was measured at baseline and 12 months.Baseline bone turnover status correlated positively and significantly with BMD response. The highest correlations occurred for the LS BMD response to teriparatide 20 microg/day. Among all studied biochemical markers, increases in PICP at 1 month and PINP at 3 months correlated best with increases in LS BMD at 18 months (0.65 and 0.61, respectively; p < 0.05). The relationships between these two biochemical markers and the LS BMD response were stronger than the corresponding relationships for the femoral neck BMD response. Using receiver operator curve analysis, we determined that the increases in PICP at 1 month and PINP at 3 months were the most sensitive and accurate predictors of the LS BMD response.",0

Lumbar extensor strength was quantified as the degree from horizontal on a modified Sorensen test procedure. Patients unable to assume the horizontal position were assumed to have strength deficits. Lumbar muscular endurance performance was quantified by the amount of time patients could hold the Sorensen test position at the horizontal. The time rate of lumbar muscular endurance adaptations were analyzed using longitudinal growth curve modeling.The adherence rate of this program was low (67%). Twenty percent of the patients were identified as having strength deficits. These deficits were corrected in all patients within 3 to 9 weeks. Linear mixed-model results suggest an improvement of 5.6 seconds in hold time per week of exercise. Both the initial level of endurance and the rates of improvements were highly individualized.The time course of musculoskeletal performance adaptations in persons with a history of lumbar surgery is highly individualized. When compared to normative endurance times, the results of this study indicate that the number of sessions and duration of therapy needed to generate meaningful adaptations of the paraspinal musculature is longer than what is typically provided in the clinic postsurgery.Therapy, level 4.J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2010;40(6):336-344, Epub 13 May 2010. doi:10.2519/jospt.2010.3141.",0

In this prospective study, patients were assigned randomly to either spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia groups. Hemodynamic variables, intraoperative opioid requirements, postoperative pain scores and analgesic requirements and complications were recorded. Patients were handed a questionnaire about the procedure they underwent to determine patient satisfaction. The costs of preoperative and postoperative anesthesia procedures, medications, and hospitalization were calculated individually.Spinal anesthesia and general anesthesia were similar concerning hemodynamic stability, first urination time, first mobilization time, postoperative analgesic requirement, and pain. Patients in group S needed less additional dose of fentanyl intraoperatively than the patients in group G. Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in Group S when compared to Group G. Total cost was higher in Group G compared to Group S.We conclude that successful LDH surgery can be performed using either anesthesia type. As long as patients are selected carefully, spinal anesthesia is a safe, comfortable, and a more economical alternative.",0

The procedure through the dorsal sacral foramen is difficult because of the long insertion route. We investigated whether the transsacral epidural block could be simplified by using a median approach instead of a lateral approach through the foramen. Thirty patients for transurethral resection of bladder tumor had a catheter placed 5 cm cephalad at S2-3 (15 patients) or caudal (15 patients) epidural space using a 19-gauge Tuohy needle by the median approach. Lidocaine 2% 15 mL was administered for anesthesia. Anesthesia level (sensory block to cold), hemodynamics, and side effects were compared between the two approaches. The success rate of anesthesia was 87% for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (proximal anesthesia level higher than T10) and 100% for the sacral region (S1-5) in both groups. The highest level of anesthesia (median, T8 in the S2-3 group and T9 in the caudal group) was obtained in 20 min in both groups. No side effects were observed. We conclude that the median transsacral epidural approach is technically feasible in adults and presents an alternative to caudal block.The median approach to transsacral epidural block has been described in children. We found that it is technically feasible in adults and presents an alternative to caudal block for procedures on the rectal, anal, or urethral region.",0

The methodology used for the analyses, including the justification, as well as the implications of responder analyses on the conclusions was explored.A convenience sample of four systematic reviews evaluating 162 RCTs of interventions for chronic LBP was used to identify individual trials. Randomised trials were screened by two reviewers and included if they performed and reported a responder analysis (i.e. the proportion of participants achieving a pre-defined level of improvement). The cutoff value for responders, the period of follow-up, and the outcome measure used were extracted. Information on how RCT authors justified the methodology of their responder analyses was also appraised.Twenty-eight articles (17%) using 20 different definitions of responders were included in this appraisal. Justification for the definition of responders was absent in 80% of the articles. Pain was the most frequently used domain for the definition of response (50%), followed by back-specific function (30%) and a combination of pain and function (20%). A reduction in pain intensity ≥50% was the most common threshold used to define responders (IQR 33-60%).Few RCTs of interventions for chronic LBP report responder analyses. Where responder analyses are used, the methods are inconsistent. When performing responder analyses authors are encouraged to follow the recommended guidelines, using empirically derived cutoffs, and present results alongside mean differences.",0

This is the first report of a biopsy study after treatment with teriparatide having a sufficient number of paired biopsy samples to provide quantitative structural data.Fifty-one paired iliac crest bone biopsy specimens (placebo [n = 19], 20 microg teriparatide [n = 18], and 40 microg teriparatide [n = 14]) were analyzed using both two-dimensional (2D) histomorphometry and three-dimensional (3D) microcomputed tomography (microCT). Data for both teriparatide treatment groups were pooled for analysis.By 2D histomorphometric analyses, teriparatide significantly increased cancellous bone volume (median percent change: teriparatide, 14%; placebo, -24%; p = 0.001) and reduced marrow star volume (teriparatide, -16%; placebo, 112%; p = 0.004). Teriparatide administration was not associated with osteomalacia or woven bone, and there were no significant changes in mineral appositional rate or wall thickness. By 3D cancellous and cortical bone structural analyses, teriparatide significantly decreased the cancellous structure model index (teriparatide, -12%; placebo, 7%; p = 0.025), increased cancellous connectivity density (teriparatide, 19%; placebo, - 14%; p = 0.034), and increased cortical thickness (teriparatide, 22%; placebo, 3%; p = 0.012). These data show that teriparatide treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis significantly increased cancellous bone volume and connectivity, improved trabecular morphology with a shift toward a more plate-like structure, and increased cortical bone thickness. These changes in cancellous and cortical bone morphology should improve biomechanical competence and are consistent with the substantially reduced incidences of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures during administration of teriparatide.",0

The pathophysiology of spinal radicular pain is the subject of ongoing research and controversy with discogenic pain assuming a major role as a cause of non-specific low back pain. Even though epidural injections are frequently administered in managing axial low back pain, the evidence is lacking.A randomized, double-blind, equivalence trial.An interventional pain management practice, a specialty referral center, a private practice setting in the United States.To evaluate the effectiveness of caudal epidural injections with or without steroids in managing chronic low back pain without disc herniation or radiculitis in providing effective and long-lasting pain relief and to evaluate the differences between local anesthetic with or without steroids.Patients were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups, Group I patients received caudal epidural injections with local anesthetic (lidocaine 0.5%), whereas Group II patients received caudal epidural injections with 0.5% lidocaine 9 mL mixed with 1 mL of steroid. Randomization was performed by computer-generated random allocation sequence by simple randomization.Multiple outcome measures were utilized which included the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI), employment status, and opioid intake with assessment at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-treatment. Significant pain relief was defined as 50% or more, whereas significant improvement in disability score was defined as reduction of 40% or more.Significant pain relief (> or =50%) was demonstrated in 72% to 81% of patients and functional status improvement was demonstrated by a reduction of 40% in the ODI scores in 81% of the patients. The overall average procedures per year were 3.6 +/- 1.05 in Group I and 3.9 +/- 1.33 in Group II with an average total relief per year of 32.3 +/- 16.93 weeks in Group I and 30.7 +/- 17.94 weeks in Group II over a period of 52 weeks.The results of this study are limited by lack of a placebo group and a preliminary report of 36 patients in each group.Caudal epidural injections with or without steroids may be effective in patients with chronic function-limiting low back pain without facet joint pain, disc herniation, and/or radiculitis in over 70% of the patients.",0

In a double-blind study, 60 patients with ASA physical status I-II were randomised into two groups. Group dextromethorphan (n = 30; age: 15.9 +/- 2.4 years) was given oral dextromethorphan 30 or 45 mg 1 hr before surgery and 8, 20 and 32 hr after operation. Group placebo (n = 30; age: 16.5 +/- 2.7 years) received placebo at identical times. Post-operative analgesic requirements were assessed using nurse-controlled analgesia system. Pain was assessed using numeric rating scale before first administration of morphine and at 2, 3, 4, 6, 24 and 48 hr after operation. Blood samples were taken 20 min. after the first use of morphine (within 1 hr after operation). The total use of analgesics during surgery was lower in the dextromethorphan group. The dose of morphine providing relief immediately after surgery, as well as total analgesic requirements in the first and second day after surgery did not differ between groups. Subjectively evaluated pain intensity score (numeric rating scale) was lower for the dextromethorphan patients in the first 4 hr, but not later after surgery. Plasma levels of morphine, morphine-6-glucuronide and morphine-3-glucuronide did not differ between groups. Dextromethorphan did not influence morphine glucuronidation, in terms of promotion of formation of any morphine glucuronides. In conclusion, in young patients subjected to spine surgery, addition of dextromethorphan to morphine reduced pain only in early post-operative period. In such patients, co-analgesic action of dextromethorphan was not associated with significant changes in plasma levels of morphine metabolites.",0

Of the 63 young patients who received renal transplant and were subjected to dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), 30 patients had low-bone mineral density (BMD) (z-score ≤−1) and were enrolled into the study. Their mean age at the time of transplantation was 14.5 ± 4.0 years and the mean duration after transplantation was 48 ± 34 months. Patients with low BMD were randomized into two equal homogeneous groups: group 1 (control) received placebo and group 2 received daily alfacalcidol 0.25 μg by mouth. Parameters of bone metabolism (intact parathyroid hormone, serum osteocalcin and urinary deoxypyridinoline) and BMD were assessed before and after the study period.

Apixaban, an orally active factor Xa inhibitor, might be as effective, have lower bleeding risk, and be easier to use than is enoxaparin. We assessed efficacy and safety of these drugs after elective total knee replacement.In ADVANCE-2, a multicentre, randomised, double-blind phase 3 study, patients undergoing elective unilateral or bilateral total knee replacement were randomly allocated through an interactive central telephone system to receive oral apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily (n=1528) or subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily (1529). The randomisation schedule was generated by the Bristol-Myers Squibb randomisation centre and stratified by study site and by unilateral or bilateral surgery with a block size of four. Investigators, patients, statisticians, adjudicators, and steering committee were masked to allocation. Apixaban was started 12-24 h after wound closure and enoxaparin 12 h before surgery; both drugs were continued for 10-14 days, when bilateral ascending venography was scheduled. Primary outcome was the composite of asymptomatic and symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism, and all-cause death during treatment. The statistical plan required non-inferiority of apixaban before testing for superiority; analysis was by intention to treat for non-inferiority testing. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00452530.1973 of 3057 patients allocated to treatment (1528 apixaban, 1529 enoxaparin) were eligible for primary efficacy analysis.

Exclusion criteria were surgery expected to last more than 2 h, American Society of Anesthesiologists status more than II, age more than 70 years, abnormal neck, throat, and mouth anatomy and function, Mallampati score III-IV, BMI more than 35 kg m, anticipated difficult airway/mask ventilation and decreased neck mobility.Patients in the LM group placed themselves in the prone position, anaesthesia was induced and a laryngeal mask was introduced. Patients in the ET group were anaesthetised, intubated and then placed in the prone position.Time taken from identification of the patient at the outset to readiness for radiographic examination following anaesthesia and positioning. Airway problems, sore throat, hoarseness and pain from muscles and joints were also noted.One hundred and forty patients were randomised to LM (n = 70) and ET (n = 70). Data from 64 and 67 patients were analysed. Values are expressed as median (interquartiles) [range]. The primary outcome time was 25 min (23 to 29) [16 to 44] in the LM group and 30 min (26 to 33) [17 to 47] in the ET group (P <0.001).

Thirty emergency medicine residents attempted to intubate a manikin using four progressively more difficult airway settings (normal airway [scenario 1], cervical spine immobilization [scenario 2], cervical spine immobilization + tongue swelling scenario [scenario 3], and cervical spine immobilization + tongue swelling + limited jaw opening scenario [scenario 4]) with both the C-MAC video laryngoscope and the Bonfils intubation fiberscope and direct laryngoscope.In the first and the second scenarios, there were no statistically significant differences between the airway devices in terms of the duration of endotracheal intubation, the viewing duration of the glottic opening, and endotracheal tube insertion time. There was no statistically significant difference between the laryngoscopes in terms of the duration of endotracheal intubation and endotracheal tube insertion time in the third scenario. The overall success rates and the viewing duration of the glottic opening were shorter with the C-MAC and Bonfils in scenarios 3 and 4. Furthermore, the duration of intubation was better with Bonfils in scenario 4. The severity of dental trauma was lowest with the Bonfils in all scenarios.

The age of the patients, who received rigid and dynamic instrumentation was 65 +/- 9 years and 62 +/- 10 years respectively. All patients had standing spine radiographs preoperatively and three months postoperatively. The parameters that were measured and compared pre- to postoperatively were: lumbar lordosis (L1-S1), total lumbar lordosis (T12-S1), sacral tilt, distal lordosis (L4-S1), intervertebral angulation, vertebral inclination and disc index.The instrumented levels in the spines that received rigid and dynamic instrumentation were 3.5 +/- 0.53 and 3 +/- 0.7 respectively. The instrumented levels from L3 to L5 were 23, the lumbosacral junction was instrumented in 3 patients of group A and in 4 patients of group B. Lumbar lordosis did not significantly change postoperatively, while total lordosis was significantly (P=0.04) increased in the patients who received the rigid instrumentation, while it was significantly (P=0.012) decreased in the group B. Intervertebral angulation of the non-instrumented level L1-L2 was increased in the group A (P=0.01), while the dynamic instrumentation increased (P=0.02) the intervertebral inclination of the adjacent level L2-L3, immediately above the uppermost instrumented level. Distal lordosis and sacral tilt did not change in any patient in both groups. Both instrumentations did not change the lateral vertebral inclination of L1 to L5 vertebrae. Rigid instrumentation increased the lordotic inclination of L5 (P=0.03) and of S1 (P=0.03). Rigid instrumentation increased (P=0.04) the intervertebral angulation at the uppermost instrumented level L3-L4 The most significant change in vertebral angulation was achieved at the instrumented level L4-L5 by the dynamic (P=0.007) and rigid (0.05). The disc index at the level L2-L3 was increased by both instrumentation [dynamic P=0.007 and rigid (P=0.02)]. The index L3-L4 was increased following dynamic fixation (P=0.0007). The disc index L4-L5 was postoperatively increased by both types of instrumentation (rigid P=0.006, dynamic P=0.02). The disc index L5-S1 did not significantly change postoperatively by either system.Both rigid and dynamic instrumentations restored lumbar lordosis, sacral tilt, distal lordosis and increased the foraminal diameter at the level L4-L5 resulting in an indirect decompression of the nerve roots at this level . Both rigid and dynamic instrumentations applied in the lumbosacral spine to treat degenerative disease secured L3 to S1 sagittal spine profile close to preoperative levels, that should theoretically guarantee a pain-free postoperative course. This study supports the belief that the dynamic system can be used with the same indications with the rigid in degenerative lumbar spine because it can offer equally good short-term results regarding sagittal spine alignment while simultaneously it has the previously mentioned advantages (avoidance stress shielding etc).",0

Group 1 had 23 patients who underwent posterior lumbar fusion using a nerve root retractor to drag nerve root, and Group 2 also had 23 patients who underwent the same operation by fixing Kirschner wires in the vertebral body to drag nerve root. All of these patients were assessed with visual analog scales (VAS) and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores before surgery, and were followed up at the time points of one week (VAS score only), three, six, and twelve months respectively after surgery. The actual retraction time of the nerve root of each patient was also recorded during the operation.The differences in VAS and JOA scores were not significant between Group 1 and 2 before surgery. However, these scores showed significant improvement in Group 2 at one week and three months after surgery compared with those in Group 1. At six and twelve month follow-up time points, no significant difference was observed between these two groups. However, the retraction time of the nerve root of the patients in Group 2 was significantly shorter than in Group 1.Using Kirschner wires instead of the nerve root retractor to pull nerve root in the patients with a single-level lumbar disc herniation accompanied by the lumbar instability is more effective in reducing the dragging damage of the nerve root at early phases after surgery and in shortening retraction time.",0

This planned side-study assessed patterns of care regarding detection and treatment of osteopenia/osteoporosis, and trends in bone mineral density (BMD) during and after therapy. We registered all BMD measurements and bisphosphonate-use. Time to osteopenia/osteoporosis was analysed by Kaplan Meier methodology. For the trend in T-scores we used linear mixed models with random patients effects. Of 1860 eligible DATA patients, 910 (48.9%) had a baseline BMD measurement. Among patients with a normal baseline BMD (n = 417), osteopenia was observed in 53.5% and 55.4% in the 6- and 3-year group respectively (p = 0.18), during follow-up. Only two patients (3-year group) developed osteoporosis. Of the patients with osteopenia at baseline (n = 408), 24.4% and 20.4% developed osteoporosis respectively (p = 0.89). Three years after randomisation 18.3% and 18.2% used bisphosphonates in the 6- and 3-year groups respectively and 6 years after randomisation this was 23.7% and 20.9% respectively (p = 0.90) of which the majority used oral bisphosphonates. The yearly mean BMD-change during anastrozole in the lumbar spine showed a T-score decline of 0.075. After bisphosphonate addition the decline became less prominent (0.047 (p < 0.001)) and after anastrozole cessation, while continuing bisphosphonates, the mean BMD yearly increased (0.047 (p < 0.001)). In conclusion, extended anastrozole therapy was not associated with a higher incidence of osteoporosis. Anastrozole-use was associated with a BMD decrease; however, the decline was modest and partially reversible after anastrozole cessation.",0

The incidence of bleeding complications requiring reoperation was assessed based on operative reports in the institutional cohort.Associations of patient and procedure factors with VTE were characterized in the NSQIP population. In the single-institution cohort, in addition to NSQIP variables, a chart review was completed to determine the use of VTE prophylaxis, the history of prior VTE, and the incidence of hematoma requiring reoperation. The association of patient and procedure variables, including pharmacologic prophylaxis and history of prior VTE, with VTE and hematoma requiring reoperation were determined with multivariate regression.Among 109,609 elective spine surgery patients in NSQIP, independent risk factors for VTE were greater age, male gender, increasing body mass index, dependent functional status, lumbar spine surgery, longer operative time, perioperative blood transfusion, longer length of stay, and other postoperative complications. There were 2,855 patients included in the institutional cohort. Pharmacologic prophylaxis was performed in 56.3% of the institutional patients, of whom 97.1% received unfractionated heparin. When controlling for patient and procedural variables, pharmacologic prophylaxis did not significantly influence the rate of VTE, but was associated with a significant increase in hematoma requiring a return to the operating room (relative risk=7.37, p=.048).Pharmacologic prophylaxis, primarily with unfractionated heparin, after elective spine surgery was not associated with a significant reduction in VTE. However, there was a significant increase in postoperative hematoma requiring reoperation among patients undergoing prophylaxis. This raises questions about the routine use of unfractionated heparin for VTE prophylaxis and supports the need for further consideration of risks and benefits of chemoprophylaxis after elective spine surgery.",0

Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were recorded at rest and after exercise in three conditions: (1) no TLSO (control); (2) TLSO (closed); and (3) TLSO (open).Wearing a TLSO (closed or open) reduced FVC and FEV1 similarly at rest (p < 0.001) and after exercise (p < 0.001) compared with controls. Adding an abdominal cutout (open) to the TLSO increased FVC at rest (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.79-4.76; p = 0.007) and postexercise (95% CI, 3.80-4.73; p = 0.025) compared with the closed TLSO, and FEV1 increased postexercise (95% CI, 3.01-3.76; p = 0.02) but not at rest (95% CI, 2.96-3.73; p = 0.053).TLSOs restrict pulmonary function in healthy adults. An abdominal cutout in the TLSO increased pulmonary function, especially with activity, suggesting that cutouts should be considered when fabricating TLSOs for individuals with compromised breathing such as with neuromuscular disorders, scoliosis, or spine surgery.",0

Results show that pamidronate is safe and significantly reduced spinal bone loss when administered immediately after renal transplantation. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this work is to evaluate the efficacy of two intravenous infusions of pamidronate in the immediate post-transplant period in a renal transplant (RT) population. METHODS: In this 12-month, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial, 39 kidney recipients with diagnosed osteopenia received two doses of 30 mg of disodium pamidronate (n = 24) or placebo (n = 15), at surgery and 3 months post-RT. All patients received calcium and vitamin D. Bone density of the lumbar spine and total femur was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and X-rays were performed at RT, 6 and 12 months post-RT. Biochemical and hormonal determinations were performed before and after treatment. RESULTS: Pamidronate significantly reduced spinal bone loss, but no significant benefit was found for the incidence of fractures. Elevated baseline intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and bone remodeling markers returned to normal levels 3 months post-RT. However, normal procollagen type I N propeptide (PINP) concentrations were only maintained in the pamidronate group. After RT, a comparable graft function was observed in both groups according to creatinine values, 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25-OH-D) levels were improved, and serum calcium levels normalized after a transient fall during the first 3 months. CONCLUSION: A low dose of pamidronate prevents bone loss in osteopenic patients when administered immediately after RT.",0
135,https://openalex.org/W2183810148,,Comparison of unilateral spinal anesthesia and L₁ paravertebral block combined with psoas compartment and sciatic nerve block in patients to undergo partial hip prosthesis.,"Just as hip prosthesis, most of the patients undergoing orthopedic lower extremity surgery (OLES) belong to the advanced age group. Sciatic nerve block combined with psoas compartment block is used as a technique alternative to central neuraxial block and GA. In geriatric patients that will undergo partial hip prosthesis, the effects of the methods of unilateral spinal anesthesia (SA) and L1 paravertebral block combined with psoas compartment block (PCB) and sciatic nerve block (PCSL) on peroperative hemodynamic parameters and the duration of need for postoperative analgesia were studied.Fifty patients from the ASA III-IV group were randomly divided into two groups. Group SA was administered spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine (2 ml, 0.5%) from the selected intervertebral distance (L4-L5 or L3-L4) in lateral position. Group PCSL was administered L1 paravertebral block combined with PCB and sciatic nerve block with bupivacaine hydrochloride (total 35 ml). Hemodynamic parameters (HR: heart rate and MAP: mean artery pressure) were recorded in pre- and post-intervention 5-minute intervals. The initial time of the need for analgesia of patients were evaluated postoperatively.Any failure in methods implemented on patients in either group was not observed. Times of anesthesia and surgical preparation of patients were observed to have significantly prolonged in the PCSL compared to Group SA (p < 0.005). Hundred and 5th and 110th min. mean arterial pressures of patients was found to be significantly higher in Group SA compared to Group PCSL (p < 0.05). The initial time of the need for analgesia was observed to be significantly prolonged in Group PCSL (432.80 ± 236.77 min) compared to Group SA (185.40 ± 171.40 min) (p < 0.001).Unilateral SA conducted with bupivacaine hydrochloride and PCSL block technique provided a hemodynamically similar activity in the perioperative period in patients that underwent partial hip operation. However, PCSL block implementation extended the initial time of the need for analgesia in postoperative period. PCSL method could be selected in cases belonging to such group of patients. PCSL block can be a alternative anesthetic tecniques in patients that underwent partial hip operation.",0

On the other hand, there is no coagulation defect during the surgery. Effective prevention of postoperative pain may require continuous sensory ablation throughout the surgery event. <h3>Methods:</h3> A prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative epidural anesthesia on postoperative morphine consumption via patient-controlled analgesia after liver surgery in 2 groups of patients. One group (epidural) received, intraoperatively, thoracic epidural bupivacaine perfusion (0.5% at 3 mL/hr) added to preoperative intrathecal morphine (0.5 mg) and fentanyl (15 μg). The other group (placebo) was administered the same intrathecal narcotics but with a sham epidural. Forty-four patients scheduled for major liver resection (≥2 segments) were recruited. Patient-controlled analgesia morphine consumption, pain at rest and with movement, sedation, nausea, pruritus, and respiratory frequency were evaluated at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hrs after intrathecal morphine injection. <h3>Results:</h3> Patients in the placebo group consumed twice as much morphine during each time interval than patients in the epidural group (at 48 hrs: 123 [SD, 46] vs 59 [SD, 25] mg; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). Pain evaluation on visual analog scale at rest and on movement was lower in the epidural group (<i>P</i> = 0.017 and <i>P</i> = 0.037). <h3>Conclusion:</h3> Intraoperative thoracic epidural infusion of bupivacaine, added to intrathecal morphine, decreased postoperative morphine consumption with better pain relief compared with the placebo.",0

There is no standard therapeutic intervention to prevent osteoporosis in heart transplant recipients (HTR). The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a regimen combining the antiresorptive properties of nasal calcitonin with the osteogenic stimulus of resistance exercise.Eighteen candidates for heart transplantation were randomly assigned either to a group that received calcitonin and participated in 6 months of resistance exercise (n=10) or to a group that received only calcitonin (n=8). Calcitonin therapy (200 IU daily for 8 months) was initiated 48 hr after transplantation. Resistance exercise was initiated 2 months after transplantation. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the total body, femur neck, and lumbar vertebra (L2-3) were assessed before, and at 2 and 8 months after transplantation.Total body and femur neck BMD did not decrease (P>or=0.05) below pretransplantation values at 2 months after transplantation in either group. BMD of the lumbar spine was significantly (P<or=0.05) and comparably decreased at 2 months after transplantation in the calcitonin (-10.1+/-1.8%) and calcitonin + training groups (-12.9+/-2.7%). At 8 months after transplantation lumbar BMD was -16.9% below pretransplant values in the calcitonin group. In contrast, lumbar BMD was restored to within 5% of pretransplant levels in the calcitonin + training group.Calcitonin attenuates BMD loss in the total body and femur neck but not in trabecular bone of the lumbar vertebra. Mechanical loading, through progressive resistance exercise, is an osteogenic stimulus in HTR.",0

Anesthesia was induced with remifentanil 1 microg kg(-1) or alfentanil 20 microg kg(-1) with propofol 2 mg kg(-1), and maintained with infusions of propofol 150 to 100 microg kg(-1)min(-1) and either remifentanil 0.1 microg kg(-1) min(-1) or alfentanil 0.5 microg kg(-1) min(-1).Hemodynamic parameters (heart rate and mean arterial pressure), times to awakening, and tracheal extubation were recorded. In the postanesthesia care unit, pain level, frequency of analgesic demand, frequency of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), partial oxygen saturation (SpO2), and respiratory rates were noted. Drug dosages and costs of each technique were determined.The mean arterial pressure significantly decreased compared to baseline values 1 minute after induction (p < 0.05) in both groups, and it significantly decreased at 5, 15, and 30 minutes perioperatively in the remifentanil group compared to the alfentanil group (p < 0.05). Time of extubation, spontaneous eye opening, and response to verbal command were similar in both groups. Visual analog scale pain scores at 30 minutes and 60 minutes were significantly lower in the alfentanil group than remifentanil group (p < 0.05). At 15, 30, and 60 minutes after terminating the operation oxygen saturation and respiratory rate were significantly higher (p < 0.05) and analgesics were required sooner in the remifentanil group than the alfentanil group (p < 0.05). The frequency of PONV was similar in both groups. The remifentanil-propofol anesthesia was found to be slightly more expensive as compared to the alfentanil based TIVA (33.41 +/- 4.53 vs. 29.97 +/- 4.1 USD) (p < 0.05).Both remifentanil and alfentanil provided a reasonably rapid and reliable recovery. The remifentanil-based TIVA was associated with high intraoperative cost and early postoperative pain, but it allowed a more rapid respiratory recovery.",0

After Ethics Committee approval and informed consent had been obtained, 64 patients were allocated into three groups. Patients received oral paracetamol-codeine (300 mg + 30 mg; Group P), naproxen sodium-codeine (550 mg + 30 mg; Group N), or placebo tablets (Group C) 30 minutes prior to induction of anesthesia. Patient-controlled analgesia was supplied postoperatively using tramadol. Pain intensity, tramadol consumption, and side effects were recorded every 1 hour, 2 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours after surgery. Whole study period pain intensity (visual analogue scale scores) was lower in Group P (p = 0.007) and Group N (p = 0.001), compared with Group C, however, there was no statistically significant difference between Group P and Group N regarding pain intensity (p > 0.05). Tramadol consumption was lower in Group P and Group N, compared with Group C (p < 0.001), and in turn the lowest incidence of tramadol consumption was detected in Group P compared with Group N (p < 0.001) and Group C (p < 0.001). Side effects were similar between the groups. Preemptive administration of paracetamol-codeine and naproxen sodium-codeine combination significantly reduced tramadol consumption and provided more effective analgesia compared with placebo. The paracetamol-codeine combination was superior to naproxen sodium-codeine with regard to tramadol consumption.",0

Methods Fifty-five cats with a normal neurologic examination that were referred for elective gonadectomy were divided into group 1 (29 cats) for testing the extensor carpi radialis reflex, and group 2 (26 cats) for testing the cranial tibial reflex. In group 1, the extensor carpi radialis reflex was tested after anesthetic induction and 15 mins after brachial plexus block with lidocaine. In group 2, the cranial tibial, withdrawal and patellar reflexes were elicited in 52 hindlimbs and retested 15 mins after epidural anesthesia. Results In group 1, before the anesthetic block, 55.17% of the cats had a decreased and 44.83% had a normal extensor carpi radialis reflex. After the block, 68.96% showed a decreased and 27.59% a normal reflex. No cat had an increased or absent reflex before anesthetic block. In group 2, prior to the anesthetic block, 15.38% of the cats had a decreased cranial tibial reflex and 84.62% had a normal response, whereas after the block it was decreased in 26.92% and normal in 73.08% of the cats. None of the cats had an increased or absent reflex. Regarding the presence of both reflexes before and after anesthetic block, there was no significant difference at 1% ( P = 0.013). Conclusions and relevance The extensor carpi radialis and cranial tibial reflexes in cats are not strictly myotatic reflexes, as they are independent of the reflex arc, and may be idiomuscular responses. Therefore, they are not reliable for neurologic examination in this species.",0

The 13th thoracic (T13), first lumbar (L1) and second lumbar (L2) nerves were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine (group GLI, n = 9), 0.5% levobupivacaine (group GLE, n = 8) or 0.5% ropivacaine (group GRO, n = 9); 1.5 mL on the dorsal branch and 2.5 mL on the ventral branch, total volume of 12 mL per ewe. Anesthesia onset time and duration were assessed by application of superficial and deep pin pricks, and skin clamping with a hemostat. Heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature and systemic arterial pressures were recorded prior to nerve block (T0), after the anesthetic agent injection and onset time (T1) and predetermined time points during the surgical procedure (T2-T6).Incomplete nerve blocks were present in five of the 26 ewes enrolled in the study and they were not included in the statistical analyzes. Onset times in GLI, GLE and GRO were 1.5 ± 0.5, 3.1 ± 1.5 and 2.1 ± 0.8 minutes, respectively, with GLE significantly longer than GLI. The durations of anesthesia for GLI, GLE and GRO were 80 ± 27, 649 ± 68 and 590 ± 40 minutes, respectively, with the duration of GLI significantly shorter than GLE and GRO. There were no clinically important changes in cardiopulmonary variables.Administration of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine at the distal paravertebral site to block nerves T13, L1 and L2 produced a longer duration of anesthesia of the ewe's flanks compared with lidocaine.",0

ROTEM analysis was performed, concentrations of coagulation factors and markers of thrombin generation were measured. Fibrinogen concentrate (Hemocomplettan) was administered (30 mg/kg) when thrombelastographically measured fibrinogen polymerization was critically decreased.The alpha angle, clot firmness, and fibrinogen polymerization (median [min to max]) significantly decreased in the patients receiving hydroxyethyl starch (area under the curve minus baseline (-5 [-9 to -2]), followed by gelatin solution (-3 [-8 to 0]), with the least reductions seen for Ringer lactate solution (-2 [- 4 to 1]) (colloids versus Ringer lactate P < 0.0001). Thirteen patients in the colloid groups but none in the Ringer lactate group needed fibrinogen concentrate to maintain borderline clot firmness. Activity of FVII, FVIII, FIX, and von Willebrand ristocetin activity decreased significantly with colloids. Thrombelastographically measured coagulation time, molecular markers of thrombin generation, and activity of all other coagulation factors were comparable in all groups.Disturbance of fibrinogen/fibrin polymerization is the primary problem triggering dilutional coagulopathy during major orthopedic surgery. The magnitude of clot firmness reduction is determined by the type of fluid used, with hydroxyethyl starch showing the most pronounced effects. These undesirable effects of intravascular volume therapy can be reversed by increasing fibrinogen concentration by administering fibrinogen concentrate, even during continuing blood loss and intravascular volume replacement.",0

Paired t-test indicated that both interventions resulted in significant increased height (P < .0001). Decreases in pain after aquatic intervention (2.7 ± 2.1 cm) were significantly greater than decreases after land intervention (1.7 ± 1.7 cm; P = .0034), and centralization of symptoms was more pronounced after aquatic vertical suspension compared with the supine land-based flexion condition (P < .0001). A significant correlation between height change and both pain reduction (r = 0.39; P = .001) and centralization (r = 0.29; P = .013) was observed for the aquatic intervention only.Although both the aquatic and land interventions produced significant increases in overall spinal height, the aquatic intervention produced greater pain relief and centralization response in subjects with low back pain and signs of nerve root compression.",0

We prospectively compared the efficacy of PVB via a catheter technique with the efficacy of general anesthesia (GA) for minor breast surgery. Thirty patients were randomized into two groups to receive either PVB or GA. Variables of efficacy were postoperative pain measured on a visual analog scale, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), recovery time, and patient satisfaction. Postoperative visual analog scale scores in the PVB group were significantly lower in the early postoperative period (maximum, 12 vs 45 mm; P < 0.01). In both groups, PONV was nearly absent. There was no difference in recovery time. Patient satisfaction was better in the PVB group (2.8 vs 2.3; scale, 0-3; P < 0.01). There was one inadvertent epidural block and one inadvertent pleural puncture in the PVB group. Although PVB resulted in better postoperative pain relief, the advantages over GA were marginal in this patient group because postoperative pain was relatively mild and the incidence of PONV was small. Considering that the technique has a certain complication rate, we conclude that at present the risk/benefit ratio of PVB does not favor routine use for minor breast surgery.This study confirms the previously reported superior pain relief after paravertebral blockade (PVB) for breast surgery. However, considering the relatively mild postoperative pain and therefore the limited advantage of PVB for these patients, the risk/benefit ratio does not favor the routine use of PVB for minor breast surgery.",0

The complement of this probability was adopted as a measure of the credibility of correct responses.The credibility of responses varied from 50% to 95%, and was determined less by the agents used but more by what information was given to patients and if the agents were fully randomized for each block.Randomized, comparative local anesthetic blocks offer a credibility of 75%, but randomized, placebo-controlled blocks provide a credibility of 95%, and are thereby suitable as a criterion standard for diagnostic blocks.",0

However, the therapeutic mechanisms of infliximab against pain have not been elucidated experimentally.Twenty rats were used in this study. In the test groups, the animals underwent application of NP to the L4 nerve roots and received a single systemic (intraperitoneal) injection of infliximab at the time of surgery (Infli-0 group, n = 5) or at 1 day after operation (Infli-1 group, n = 5). As a control treatment, sterile water was administered intraperitoneally to 5 rats with NP application (NP group) and to 5 sham-operated rats (sham group). On day 3 after surgery, the L4 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and L4 spinal segment were harvested and assessed regarding BDNF immunoreactivity. RESULTS.: Application of NP induced a marked increase of BDNF immunoreactivity in number in the DRG neurons and within the superficial layer in the dorsal horn compared with the sham group (P < 0.01). Infliximab treatment in the Infli-0 and Infli-1 groups reduced the BDNF induction in both DRG and spinal cord (P < 0.05).These findings indicate that infliximab attenuates the elevated BDNF levels induced by NP. The present study therefore further indicates the importance of TNF-alpha in sciatica due to disc herniation and the possible therapeutic use of a TNF-alpha inhibitor for this condition.",0

After 12 months, creatinine clearance decreased significantly only during methylprednisone therapy. Growth velocity increased only in patients treated with deflazacort from 3.3+/-0.6 to 5.6+/-0.5 cm/year. Serum levels of several components of the insulin-like growth factor axis did not change.

The diagnosis and treatment protocols for spine LCH remain controversial.In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of our proposed diagnosis and treatment protocol introduced in 2009.This is a retrospective study.A total of 110 patients with spine LCH who had been diagnosed and treated in our hospital from October 1997 to November 2015 were included in this study.The age, gender, symptoms, neurologic function, lesion distribution, radiological features, pathology, treatment, outcome, and treatment complications of the patients were collected. Visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and Frankel scale for neurologic status were also documented.We retrospectively reviewed 110 patients with spine LCH who had been diagnosed and treated in our hospital from October 1997 to November 2015. The indications for computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy and surgery for spine LCH have become more stringent since 2009. In cases of a solitary spinal lesion, immobilization and observation were usually first suggested. Chemotherapy was suggested for cases with multifocal LCH lesions, and low-dosage radiotherapy was restricted to recurrent solitary lesion. This project was supported by our hospital (No. Y71508-01) (¥ 400,000).This series included 69 male and 41 female patients (age range, 1-52 years). Pain was the most common symptom (93.6%, 103/110). Pathologic diagnosis was achieved in 72 cases (65.5%). CT-guided biopsies were performed in 91.3% (42/46) and 73.2% (41/56) of cases before and after 2009, respectively (p=.02). Ninety-eight cases (89.1%) were followed up for a mean 66.3 (range, 24-159) months. Immobilization and observation were performed in 25.9% (14/54) and 75.0% (42/56) of cases before and after 2009, respectively (p<.001). Approximately 35.2% (19/54) and 10.7% (6/56) of cases had surgery (p=.002) before and after 2009, respectively. During the follow-up, no significant difference was found in the outcomes between the two groups treated before and after 2009 (p=.64).Biopsy is not mandatory for typical spine lesions of LCH. Given the self-healing tendency of spine LCH, immobilization and observation remain the first-choice treatments for LCH lesions. Conservative biopsy and treatment protocols might be more appropriate for spinal LCH.",0

However, there are few experimental data available quantifying the extent to which loading parameters might interact to produce disruption in the healthy disc.Reproducible states of full and partial hydration were established for 96 isolated caudal discs. These discs were then subjected to compression under combined conditions of high or low hydration, zero or full flexion, and moderate or low loading rate. The extent of disc disruption was assessed macroscopically using a damage weighting procedure.Maximum disruption of the intact, healthy disc occurred under combined conditions of full hydration and flexion. Loading rate, whether at 0.004 MPa/sec or 4 MPa/sec, had little influence when applied without flexion, but there was an increased risk of disruption when the moderate rate was combined with full flexion.The investigation demonstrates that significant levels of disruption can be induced by mechanical loading in intact discs free of degenerative change. Our findings support the hypothesis that mechanical injury to a healthy disc might initiate a process of degeneration.",0

One of the suggested benefits of EVE is a reduction in local anaesthetic required. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by comparing the median effective doses (ED50) of hyperbaric bupivacaine with fentanyl 25 microg with and without EVE for Caesarean section.Sixty women were randomized to receive either CSE anaesthesia with EVE (EVE group) or no EVE (NEVE group). Using a double-blinded, up-down sequential technique, varying doses of bupivacaine with fentanyl 25 microg were administered. ED50 was estimated from up-down reversals and probit regression.The ED50 for bupivacaine was similar and not significantly different in the two groups (5.1 mg in the EVE and 6.1 mg in the NEVE group; difference 1.0 mg, 95% CI -0.12 to 2.2, P=0.08).This study illustrates that whilst low doses of intrathecal bupivacaine can be effectively used for Caesarean section, at such doses EVE does not appear to offer reliable or clinically relevant reductions in dosing with intrathecal bupivacaine.",0

However, little literature exists on the relationship between opioid use and PROs following epidural steroid injections for radicular pain.We evaluated the association between pre-injection opioid use and PROs following spine epidural steroid injection.This study is a retrospective analysis of a prospective longitudinal registry database.A total of 392 patients within our database who were undergoing epidural steroid injections (ESIs) at our institution for degenerative structural spine diagnoses and met our inclusion criteria were included in this study.Patient-reported outcomes for disability (Oswestry Disability Index/Neck Disability Index [ODI/NDI)]), quality of life (EuroQol-5D [EQ-5D]), and pain (Numerical Rating Scale scores for back pain, neck pain, leg pain, and arm pain [NRS-BP/NP/LP/AP]) were assessed at baseline and at 3 and 12 months post-injection.Multivariable proportional odds logistic regression models were created to examine the relationship between pre-injection opioid use and post-injection PROs. A logistic regression with Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation was used to investigate a possible cutoff value of pre-injection opioid use above which the effectiveness of ESI (as measured by minimum clinically important difference [MCID] for ODI/NDI) decreases.A total of 276 patients with complete 12-month follow-up following ESI were analyzed. The mean pre-injection daily morphine equivalent amount (MEA) was 14.7 mg (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.4 mg-19.1 mg) for the cohort. Pre-injection opioid use was associated with slightly higher odds of worse disability (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, p=.03) and leg/arm pain (OR 1.01, p=.04) scores at 3 months post-injection only. No significant association between pre-injection opioid use and MCID for ODI/NDI was found, although a cutoff of 55.5 mg/day might serve as a significant threshold.Increased pre-injection opioid use does not impact long-term outcomes after ESIs for degenerative spine diseases. A pre-injection MEA around 50 mg/day may represent a threshold above which the 3-month effectiveness of ESI for back- and neck-related disability decreases. Epidural steroid injection is an effective treatment modality for pain in patients using opioids, and can be part of a multimodal strategy for opioid independence.",0

Teriparatide was better than alendronate at improving bone mineral density and bone turnover parameters, as well as preventing aggravation of spinal cord compromise. INTRODUCTION: This study compared the preventive effects of teriparatide and alendronate on aggravation of spinal cord compromise following new unstable osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) in patients with surgical contraindications. METHODS: This was a 12-month, randomized, open-label study of teriparatide versus alendronate in 49 patients with new unstable OVCF and surgical contraindications. Neurological function was evaluated using modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score (11-point scale, the maximum score of 11 implies normalcy). Visual analog scale (VAS) scores, kyphotic angles, anterior-border heights and diameters of the spinal canal of the fractured vertebrae, any incident of new OVCFs (onset of OVCF during follow-up), spine bone mineral density (BMD), and serum markers of bone resorption and bone formation were also examined at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation of the medication regimen. RESULTS: At 12 months, mean mJOA score had improved in the teriparatide group and decreased in the alendronate group. Mean concentrations of bone formation and bone resorption biomarkers, mean spine BMD, and mean anterior-border height and spinal canal diameter of the fractured vertebrae were significantly greater in the teriparatide group than in the alendronate group. Mean VAS score, mean kyphotic angle of the fractured vertebrae, and incidence of new OVCFs were significantly smaller in the teriparatide group than in the alendronate group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with neurological deficits following new unstable OVCF and with surgical contraindications, teriparatide was better than alendronate at improving the BMD and the bone turnover parameters, as well as preventing aggravation of spinal cord compromise.",0

It is possible that fewer complications may occur if the procedure is performed under epidural anesthesia. <h3>Purpose</h3> To investigate the safety and efficacy of epidural anesthesia in elective lumbar microdiscectomies. <h3>Study design</h3> A prospective study evaluating the relative morbidities associated with epidural anesthesia and general anesthesia for lumbar microdiscectomy. <h3>Patient sample</h3> Forty-three patients scheduled for primary lumbar microdiscectomy. Two cohorts were formed and were studied separately; one observational of all the 43 patients, and a second cohort of 17 patients who agreed to enter in the randomized trial. <h3>Outcome measures</h3> The clinical outcome was determined by the presence of postoperative pain, the absence of anesthesia-related complications, and the overall postoperative recovery. <h3>Methods</h3> This was a prospective study. With institutional review board approval, 43 consecutive patients were enrolled in the study. However, only 17 patients agreed to be randomized to receive either general or epidural anesthesia for the procedure; the remaining 26 patients selected the type of anesthesia of their preference. Recorded data for all patients included: age; total surgical time; occurrence of nausea, vomiting, atelectasis, or cardiopulmonary complication; ability to arise out of bed on the day of surgery; and the total number of inpatient hospital days. Postoperative pain and satisfaction were assessed only in the randomized cohort. <h3>Results</h3> There were a total of 43 patients, with a mean age of 38.1 years. The patients undergoing epidural anesthesia were marginally older than those undergoing general anesthesia. The epidural and general anesthetic groups were not different with respect to surgical time, pain assessed with a linear visual analogue scale, hospital stay, or the likelihood of arising out of bed on the day of surgery. There were no major cardiopulmonary complications in either group. Patients with epidural anesthesia had significantly less nausea and vomiting. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Epidural anesthesia as an alternative to general anesthesia has shown less postoperative nausea and vomiting in lumbar microdiscectomy. Nevertheless, given the small number of patients, this study should be considered as preliminary, showing small differences in minor potential complications.",0

This study aimed to determine the effect of the interaction between intravenous anesthetics and sevoflurane on the QT interval. METHODS: The study included 48 patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery. Patients received 3 ?g/kg fentanyl and were then randomly allocated to either Group T, in which they received 5 mg/kg thiamylal, or Group P, in which they received 1.5 mg/kg propofol, at 2 min after administration of fentanyl injection for anesthetic induction. Vecuronium (1.5 mg/kg) and sevoflurane (3 % inhaled concentration) were administered immediately after loss of consciousness and tracheal intubation was performed 3 min after vecuronium injection. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), bispectral index score (BIS), and the heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval on a 12-lead electrocardiogram were recorded immediately before fentanyl administration (T1), 2 min after fentanyl injection (T2), immediately before intubation (T3), and 2 min after intubation (T4). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline patient characteristics. BIS and MAP significantly decreased after anesthesia induction in both groups. At T3, MAP in Group T was higher than in Group P, while HR had reduced in both groups. The QTc interval was prolonged after anesthesia induction in Group T, but did not change at any time point in Group P. The QTc interval after anesthesia induction in Group T was longer than in Group P. CONCLUSION: We concluded that an injection of propofol could counteract QTc interval prolongation associated with sevoflurane anesthesia induction.",0

The effectiveness of this form of therapy is dependent upon compliance, which in turn is dependent on availability, response, treatment of proper acupoints, and the placebo effect. We hypothesized that classical acupuncture would be more effective than placebo acupuncture. One hundred and thirty-two patients with acute and chronic low back and leg pain were examined before and after surgery for lumbar disc protrusion. Diagnosis was based on CT and MRT findings. Patients received acupuncture drug-free throughout the study period. The visual analogue scale was used to assess pain intensity before and after (i.e. 30 min. 60 min. 2 h and 6 h) acupuncture. Classical acupuncture resulted in a significant reduction in pain that become increasingly stronger during the 6h study period. Placebo acupuncture lead to same early pain relief that did not reach statistic significant and then declined thereafter.",0

Splenectomized Gaucher patients tend to suffer the most severe skeletal complications. We hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation would act synergistically with glucocerebrosidase infusions to increase bone density in splenectomized Gaucher patients. In a 24-month study, 29 splenectomized Gaucher patients were randomized to three groups: Group 1, calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; 0.25-3.0 microg/day) alone for the first 6 months with the addition of ceredase/cerezyme at 60 IU/kg every 2 weeks during months 7-12; Group 2, calcitriol together with ceredase/cerezyme at 60 IU/kg every 2 weeks during months 1-6; and Group 3, enzyme only at 60 IU/kg body wt every 2 weeks. In all three groups, enzyme dose was halved after the first 6 months of therapy. The primary outcome measure was bone mineral density of the lumbar spine measured by single-energy quantitative CT. Bone density by single-energy CT (P = 0.001) and by dual-energy CT (P = 0.06) declined overall, but there was no significant difference between the groups. Calcitriol had no significant effect on bone density. Fat fraction in lumbar spine increased (P = 0.000) and skeletal MRI scores improved. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.002) and serum osteocalcin increased (P = 0.008), while blood cyclic AMP and urinary deoxypyridinoline did not change appreciably. Hemoglobin, platelet counts, and liver volume significantly improved. We conclude that ERT alone, or in combination with calcitriol, cannot repair the bone composition in splenectomized adult Gaucher patients. Alternatively, measuring trabecular bone density may be an inadequate marker of clinical efficacy for treating skeletal involvement in Gaucher disease.",0

We hypothesized that ultrasound can facilitate neuraxial blockade, particularly in pregnant women with difficult topographic anatomy. METHODS: One hundred (50 lean, BMI <30 kg/m(2), and 50 obese, BMI ?30 kg/m(2)) parturients scheduled for cesarean delivery were divided into ultrasound and control groups. Subarachnoid block was performed with prepuncture ultrasound examination in lean parturients (group 1, n = 25) and in obese parturients (group 2, n = 25), and subarachnoid block was performed without prepuncture ultrasound examination in lean parturients (group 3, n = 25) and in obese parturients (group 4, n = 25). The number of puncture attempts and puncture levels were recorded. RESULTS: A lower number of puncture attempts and fewer puncture levels were detected in ultrasound (US) groups (p < 0.001). First attempt success rate under US guidance was 92 % in comparison to 44 % using a conventional technique in obese parturients (p < 0.001). In 52 % of the lean patients and in 54.2 % of the obese patients, the intercristal line was at the L3-L4 and at the L2-L3 interspace, respectively. The duration of spinal procedure was shorter in US groups (22 vs. 52 s, p = 0.031). We found a high correlation between ultrasound and needle depth (r = 0.709, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We found a high level of success in the prepuncture ultrasound-determined insertion point. The ultrasound imaging technique can be a reliable guide to facilitate spinal anesthesia, especially in obese parturients.",0

Of the 373 patients who had a cervical spine MRI scan ordered by a primary care physician, 164 (44.0%) were seen in consultation by an orthopedic surgeon or neurosurgeon, and none had spine surgery during 3 years of follow-up. Patients with severe disc herniation (likelihood ratio, 5.62, 95% confidence interval, 2.64-12.00) or severe spinal stenosis (likelihood ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-4.85) on lumbosacral spine MRI were more likely to undergo subsequent surgery. However, many patients with these MRI abnormalities did not receive surgery, and the absence of these MRI findings did not significantly lower the likelihood of subsequent surgery.Patients receiving MRI scans of the spine in the primary care setting are frequently referred for surgical assessment and most do not receive subsequent surgery. MRI scan results do not discriminate very well between those who will and will not undergo surgery, suggesting that alternative models for the assessment of patients with spinal complaints in primary care should be explored, particularly in jurisdictions with long wait times for elective spinal surgery consultation.",0

This prospective, randomised, double-blinded study aimed to determine the most appropriate length of epidural catheter that should be inserted into the epidural space for postoperative analgesia. We recruited 102 women and assigned them into three study groups (3, 5 and 7 cm insertion). An epidural catheter was inserted and epidurography was performed. Postoperatively, mean pain scores, motor and sensory levels, and any complications associated with the epidural catheter were recorded. No statistically significant difference for mean postoperative pain score was found at all study timings. Motor and sensory blockade was also statistically insignificant. Unilateral sensory analgesia developed in one patient in the 7 cm group and epidural catheter dislodgement was observed in four patients in the 3 cm group. In order to minimise catheter-related complications for postoperative analgesia, the most appropriate length that an epidural catheter should be left in the epidural space is 5 cm.

The PRF group, after ultrasound-guided localization of the ICN of the affected thoracic dermatome, sensory stimulation of the ICN was tested. Thereafter, the patient received 2 cycles PRF at 42°C temperature, for 120 seconds. The sham group, after stimulation, the same time was spent to mimic PRF. The same procedures were repeated to the upper and lower adjacent ICNs. Pain intensity using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and total analgesics consumption were assessed at the baseline, every 2 weeks for 6 months then after 9 and 12 months. The duration of effective pain relief was recorded. Quality of life was evaluated using self-evaluation questionnaires (SF-36) at baseline then after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.PRF group expressed a significant decrease on the VAS throughout the study period. VAS<30 was reported in the PRF group until the 22nd week. Pregabalin and acetaminophen consumption was significantly lower in the PRF group. The 8 domains of the SF-36 revealed a significant improvement in the PRF group when compared with the sham group throughout the study period except for the physical role which displayed nonsignificant improvement.Ultrasound-guided PRF for ICNs in combination with pharmacotherapy seems to be a safe and effective treatment modality for postherpetic neuralgia.",0

The aim of our study was to compare the clinical and anesthetic effects of isobaric bupivacaine and isobaric levobupivacaine when administered intrathecally in patients undergoing lumbar disc surgery.ASA I-III, 60 patients were enrolled in this study. Only patients with unilateral single-level (L4-5) lumbar disc hernia were selected and operated in each group and all were operated by the same surgeon. Patients were randomized into two groups, as group B (n = 30): 15 mg 0.5% isobaric bupivacaine, or group L (n = 30): 15 mg 0.5% isobaric levobupivacaine received intrathecally. The level of sensory block dermatome, degree of motor block, intraoperative sensory and motor block characteristics, and postoperative recovery times of spinal anesthesia were evaluated. The satisfaction scores of the surgeon and patients, intraoperative hemodynamic changes, intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded.The maximum level of sensory blockade was significantly higher in the levobupivacaine group (group L 7 ± 1.63, group B 8.6 ± 1.76 thoracic dermatome, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the onset time of sensory (group L 6 ± 3 min, group B 9 ± 4 min) and motor (in group L 7 ± 3 min, in group B 10 ± 4 min) blockade (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups regarding duration of operation (group L 49 ± 7.3 min, group B 52 ± 8.1, p > 0.05). Recovery times of sensory (175 ± 57 min) and motor (216 ± 59 min) blockade were significantly shorter in the levobupivacaine group (p < 0.05). Mobilization was also earlier in the levobupivacaine group (339 ± 90 min, p < 0.05). Patients' satisfaction and intraoperative, postoperative complications were similar between the two groups.Our results showed that block recovery time was shorter in the levobupivacaine group, this may be a disadvantage for longer operative procedures. But with proper patient selection this can be eliminated. Recovery time was shorter in levobupivacaine group. Therefore, postoperative neurological examination can be done earlier. In addition, early mobilization can be an advantage for postoperative recovery.",0

The study comprised 60 patients, 30 with cemented HA (group A) and 30 with cementless HA (group B). All patients underwent osteodensitometry of the contralateral hip, lumbar spine and bilateral distal femur. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was scheduled at 1 month, 6 months and 1 year after surgery. Harris Hip Score (HHS) was used for functional assessment. Overall mortality rate was 20.3% within 1 year after surgery. There were no significant differences in morbidity, mortality and hospital stay between the two groups of patients. The implantation of cemented prosthesis took statistically significantly longer than that of cementless prosthesis (79.03±3.59 vs 68.02±5.97min; p=0.00). Functional score in patients treated with cemented HA was significantly higher compared with those with cementless HA. There was a trend of less intensive reduction of bone mineral density (BMD) in regions of interest of the lumbar spine and ipsilateral distal femur in patients with cemented HA (group A), whereas bone loss was less pronounced for the contralateral hip and distal femur in patients treated with cementless HA (group B). Management of displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients with cemented and cementless HA provides a comparable outcome with regard to morbidity and mortality; however, functional outcome of patients treated with cementless HA tends to be lower. There is less intensive BMD reduction in lumbar spine and ipsilateral distal femur in patients treated with cemented HA, whereas BMD reduction in patients treated with cementless HA is more likely to be less intensive in contralateral hip and distal femur.",0

The subjects were aged 18-87 years (mean, 53 years +/- 16 [standard deviation]). Four independent readers rated the cases according to defined criteria. A subsample of 40 MR examination cases was selected for reevaluation at least 1 month later. The following findings were assessed: spondylolisthesis, disk degeneration, marrow endplate abnormality (Modic changes), posterior anular hyperintense zone (HIZ), and facet arthropathy. Inter- and intraobserver agreement in rating the data was summarized by using weighted kappa statistics.Interobserver agreement was good (kappa = 0.66) in rating disk degeneration and moderate in rating spondylolisthesis (kappa = 0.55), Modic changes (kappa = 0.59), facet arthropathy (kappa = 0.54), and posterior HIZ (kappa = 0.44). Interobserver agreement in rating the extent of Modic changes was moderate: kappa Values were 0.43 for determining superior anteroposterior extent, 0.47 for determining superior craniocaudal extent, 0.57 for determining inferior anteroposterior extent, and 0.48 for determining inferior craniocaudal extent. Intraobserver agreement was good in rating spondylolisthesis (kappa = 0.66), disk degeneration (kappa = 0.74), Modic changes (kappa = 0.64), facet arthropathy (kappa = 0.69), and posterior HIZ (kappa = 0.67). Intraobserver agreement in rating the extent of Modic changes was moderate, with kappa values of 0.54 for superior anteroposterior, 0.60 for inferior anteroposterior, 0.50 for superior craniocaudal, and 0.60 for inferior craniocaudal extent determinations.The interpretation of general lumbar spine MR characteristics has sufficient reliability to warrant the further evaluation of these features as potential prognostic indicators.",0

The trachea was successfully intubated on all occasions within 120 s. The use of a bougie was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the time to tracheal intubation.To minimise the force of laryngoscopy and movement of a potentially unstable cervical spine injury, consideration should be given to the early use of a bougie.",0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 243 patients with lumbar radicular pain due to disc herniation were recruited from two hospitals in Norway and followed up at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. On baseline lumbar magnetic resonance images, two observers independently evaluated Modic changes (types I-III; craniocaudal size 0-3). Outcomes were sensory pain (McGill Pain Questionnaire), back and leg pain (visual analogue scale, VAS). Association between Modic type and outcomes was explored with a mixed model and then by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at each time point with Modic and treatment groups (surgical, n = 126; nonsurgical, n = 117) as fixed factors, adjusted for disc degeneration, age, sex, smoking, and duration of radicular pain. Modic size was also analyzed using ANOVA. RESULTS: Pain scores had decreased significantly at 1-year follow-up. Modic type was significantly related to McGill sensory scores (mixed model: p = 0.014-0.026; ANOVA: p = 0.007 at 6 weeks), but not to VAS back pain or VAS leg pain scores. At 6 weeks, the mean McGill sensory score was higher in Modic I than in Modic II-III patients (p = 0.003) and in patients without Modic changes (p = 0.018). Modic size L1-S1 was not associated with pain outcomes. CONCLUSION: Patients with lumbar radicular pain have a substantial pain reduction during 1-year follow-up, but Modic type I changes may imply a slower initial decrease in sensory pain.",0

A randomized, controlled crossover trial","<h2>Abstract</h2><h3>Background</h3> The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether different video laryngoscopes (VLs) facilitate endotracheal intubation (ETI) faster or more secure than conventional laryngoscopy in a manikin with immobilized cervical spine. <h3>Methods</h3> After local ethics board approval, a standard airway manikin with cervical spine immobilization by means of a standard stiff collar was placed on a trauma stretcher. We compared times until glottic view, ETI, cuff block and first ventilation were achieved, and verified the endotracheal tube position, when using Macintosh laryngoscope, Glidescope Ranger, Storz C-MAC, Ambu Pentax AWS, Airtraq, and McGrath Series5 VLs in randomized order. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and McNemar's test were used for statistical analysis; <i>p</i><0.05 was considered as significant. <h3>Results</h3> Twenty-three anaesthetists (mean age 32.1±4.9 years, mean experience in anaesthesia of 6.9±4.8 years) routinely involved in the management of multitrauma patients participated. The primary study end point, time to first effective ventilation, was achieved fastest when using Macintosh laryngoscope (21.0±7.6s) and was significantly slower with all other devices (Airtraq 33.2±23.9s, <i>p</i>=0.002; Pentax AirwayScope 32.4±14.9s, <i>p</i>=0.001; Storz C-MAC 34.1±23.9s, <i>p</i><0.001; McGrath Series5 101.7±108.3s, <i>p</i><0.001; Glidescope Ranger 46.3±59.1s, <i>p</i>=0.001). Overall success rates were highest when using Macintosh, Airtraq and Storz C-MAC devices (100%), and were lower in Ambu Pentax AWS and Glidescope Ranger (87%, <i>p</i>=0.5) and in McGrath Series5 device (72.2%, <i>p</i>=0.063). <h3>Conclusion</h3> When used by experienced anaesthesiologists, video laryngoscopes did not facilitate endotracheal intubation in this model with an immobilized cervical spine in a faster or more secure way than conventional laryngoscopy. However, data was gathered in a standardized model and further studies in real trauma patients are desirable to verify our findings.",0

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol on heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval during anesthetic induction. We examined 50 patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. Patients received 3 ?g/kg of fentanyl and were randomly allocated to one of the following 2 groups. Group S patients received 5 mg/kg of thiamylal followed by sevoflurane, 5 % at the inhaled concentration. Group P patients received propofol using TCI system at 5 ?g/mL for 2 min followed by 3 ?g/mL. Tracheal intubation was performed after vecuronium administration. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), bispectral index score (BIS), and QTc interval in 12-lead electrocardiogram were recorded at the following time points: just before fentanyl administration (T1), 2 min after fentanyl injection (T2), 1 min after thiamylal injection or 2 min after the start of TCI (T3), just before intubation (T4), and 2 min after intubation (T5). BIS and MAP significantly decreased after anesthetic induction in both groups. HR decreased after anesthetic induction and recovered after tracheal intubation in group P, whereas it did changed in group S throughout the study period. QTc interval was shortened at T3 and T4 in group P, but prolonged at T3, T4, and T5 in group S, as compared with T1. Propofol TCI shortens QTc interval, whereas sevoflurane prolongs QTc interval during anesthetic induction.",0

Aim of this study was to find out whether a comparable effect of TENS applies in major spinal surgery.Thirty-eight patients of both sex scheduled for lumbar interbody fusion were enrolled and divided randomly into 3 groups. Group A received TENS preincisional and postoperative, group B received this treatment postoperative only, and group C was the sham controlled. The postoperative demand on piritramid to achieve a visual anlog scale pain score <3 was delivered either by nurse or by a patient-controlled analgesia pump, when the patients were alert. The setting of the patient-controlled analgesia pump, bolus of piritramid 2 mg intravenously (IV), lockout time of 20 minutes, and maximum dose of piritramid 15 mg within 4 hours, the coanalgesic therapy diclofenac 75 mg IV, and the rescue medication metamizol 1 g IV was identical for all patients. The total amount of piritramid administered over the first 24 hours after surgery and an optional rescue medication were recorded.All groups were compared by pairs. The postoperative demand on piritramid differed significantly A versus B (P<0.05), A versus C (P<0.05), and B versus C (P<0.05). Neither sex, body mass index, current, duration, and type of operation nor the occurrence of hypotensive phases showed any significant association with postoperative piritramid demand. The necessity of rescue medication was significantly higher in group C than in group A.Postoperative TENS as well as the combination of preincisional and postoperative TENS therapy reduce the postoperative demand of piritramid in major spinal surgery in a safe and simple way free of systemic side effects.",0

This study compared the operating conditions of general anesthesia with and without a muscle relaxant on spinal surgery patients.Eighty-six adults who underwent elective spinal surgery were randomly assigned to a relaxant group (group R) or a no-relaxant group (group NR). All patients were induced with intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg), fentanyl (4 µg/kg), propofol (1.0 mg/kg), and succinylcholine (2 mg/kg) and then atracurium was used in group R but not in group NR. The operating conditions, including muscle tone, body movements, airway pressure, anesthetics consumption, eye-opening time, extubation time, and the Observer's Assessment of the Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) score 20 minutes after the extubation were compared between the 2 groups.The operating conditions including muscle tone scales, body movements, and airway pressure did not differ between the 2 groups. Eye-opening time (9.35±2.34 vs. 11.02±2.50 min; P=0.002) and extubation time (13.95±3.41 vs. 16.72±3.67 min; P=0.001) were shorter in group NR than in group R. The BIS score at extubation (87.2±5.0 vs. 83.3±5.7; P=0.001) and the OAA/S score 20 minutes after extubation (5 [3 to 5] vs. 4 [3 to 5]; P=0.005) were significantly higher in group NR than in group R. Propofol consumption was higher in group NR than in group R (4206.10±415.80 vs. 3900.60±365.40 μg/kg, respectively; P=0.001).General anesthesia without muscle relaxant provides similar working conditions to those observed with muscle relaxant, and it is associated with earlier eye opening and extubation and higher level of consciousness on emergence from spinal surgery.",0

At transplantation and after 6 months, mean trabecular calcium concentration and trabecular morphometry were measured in bone biopsies. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck and the lumbar spine were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and serum biochemical markers of bone metabolism were determined monthly.Trabecular calcium content increased significantly in the zoledronic acid group, but remained unchanged in the placebo group. BMD at femoral neck showed no change in the zoledronic acid group, but decreased in the placebo group. BMD of the lumbar spine was increased in the zoledronic acid group without change in the placebo group. High-turnover bone disease resolved similarly in both groups, as evidenced by a significant decrease of eroded bone surface, osteoclast and osteoblast surface. Serologic markers of bone formation and resorption were significantly lower in zoledronic acid-treated patients throughout the study. Kidney transplant function was stable after zoledronic acid therapy.Our results show that administration of zoledronic acid improves the calcium content of cancellous bone after kidney transplantation. The beneficial effect of bisphosphonate therapy is further evidenced by an increase of lumbar spine BMD, and stabilization of femur BMD.",0

However, according to previous studies, its role is multifactorial, from breathing through pain perception, regulation of emotional sphere, collaborating in gastroesophageal functions, facilitating the venous and lymphatic return, to an essential role in the maintenance of lumbar spine stability. The purpose of the study was to examine whether diaphragm function parameters (thickness and range of motion) are associated with static balance maintenance. A total of 142 participants were examined and divided into three groups: G1-patients qualified for lung resection due to cancer; G2 -patients after lobe resection; G3 -healthy subjects. Diaphragm thickness and excursion was measured using ultrasonography. Stabilometric parameters of balance were assessed by Zebris FDM-S platform. Greater diaphragm thickening during active breathing and diaphragm thickness fraction were associated with better static balance parameters. Limitation of diaphragm motion during quiet breathing and deep breathing was linked to balance disorders. There was no correlation between diaphragm muscle excursion during sniff maneuvers and balance parameters. Deterioration of diaphragm function observed after thoracic surgery was closely related with deterioration of balance maintenance. Impairment of diaphragm function manifested by decrease of muscle thickness and movement restriction is strongly associated with balance disorders in a clinical sample and among healthy subjects.",0

Thirty patients were randomly divided into two equal groups. One hour before spinal anaesthesia, a eutetic mixture of local anaesthetic cream was applied to the lower lumbar spine. Sedation with nitrous oxide 50% in oxygen was given to all patients before and during induction of spinal anaesthesia, and throughout surgery. Lumbar punctures were performed at the L4-5 interspace using a 2.5 cm 22 G needle. Isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine 1 : 200 000 at a bupivacaine dose of 1 mg.kg-1 was injected in the lateral or sitting position. Measurements included heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, maximum sensory block height and duration of motor block and analgesia. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any measured parameters. Median [range] maximum block height was T5[T4-T7] in the lateral group and T5[T4-T5] in the sitting group. The median [range] duration of motor blockade was 67 [50-85] min in the lateral group and 63 [50-80] min in the sitting group. Our results indicate that in preterm infants sedated with nitrous oxide, spinal anaesthesia for inguinal herniotomy performed with isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% at a dose 1.0 mg.kg-1 in the lateral or sitting position is equally effective and is associated with minimal side effects.",0

Here, movement-control tests are considered clinically useful for screening and follow-up evaluation. However, few studies have addressed the reliability of clinical tests, and no such published data exists for marines. The present aim was therefore to determine the inter- and intra-observer reliability of clinically convenient tests emphasizing movement control of the back and hip among marines. A secondary aim was to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of these clinical tests for discriminating musculoskeletal pain disorders in this group of military personnel. Methods This inter- and intra-observer reliability study used a test-retest approach with six standardized clinical tests focusing on movement control for back and hip. Thirty-three marines (age 28.7 yrs, SD 5.9) on active duty volunteered and were recruited. They followed an in-vivo observation test procedure that covered both low- and high-load (threshold) tasks relevant for marines on operational duty. Two independent observers simultaneously rated performance as “correct” or “incorrect” following a standardized assessment protocol. Re-testing followed 7–10 days thereafter. Reliability was analysed using kappa (κ) coefficients, while discriminative power of the best-fitting tests for back- and lower-extremity pain was assessed using a multiple-variable regression model. Results Inter-observer reliability for the six tests was moderate to almost perfect with κ-coefficients ranging between 0.56-0.95. Three tests reached almost perfect inter-observer reliability with mean κ-coefficients &gt; 0.81. However, intra-observer reliability was fair-to-moderate with mean κ-coefficients between 0.22-0.58. Three tests achieved moderate intra-observer reliability with κ-coefficients &gt; 0.41. Combinations of one low- and one high-threshold test best discriminated prior back pain, but results were inconsistent for lower-extremity pain. Conclusions Our results suggest that clinical tests of movement control of back and hip are reliable for use in screening protocols using several observers with marines. However, test-retest reproducibility was less accurate, which should be considered in follow-up evaluations. The results also indicate that combinations of low- and high-threshold tests have discriminative validity for prior back pain, but were inconclusive for lower-extremity pain.",0

Therefore, weight management in LSS is critical. Body mass index is the strongest predictor of function in LSS, suggesting that weight loss may promote physical activity and provide a unique treatment option. We propose a lifestyle modification approach of physical activity and nutrition education, delivered through an e-health platform. <h3>Purpose</h3> The purpose of this study was to develop and pilot an e-health intervention aimed at increasing physical activity and decreasing fat mass in people with LSS. <h3>Study design</h3> The study design was based on intervention development and pilot. <h3>Patient sample</h3> Ten overweight or obese individuals with LSS were confirmed clinically and on imaging. <h3>Outcome measures</h3> Self-reported measures were food record, Short-Form 36 (SF-36), pain scales, Swiss Spinal Stenosis Symptom and Physical Function Scales, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Pain Catastrophizing Questionnaire, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Center for Epidemiologic Studies(<i>Depression)</i> Scale, Behavioral Regular in Exercise Questionnaire, and Regulation for Eating Behavior Scale and physiologic measures were dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), blood draw, 7-day accelerometry, self-paced walking test, and balance test. <h3>Methods</h3> The e-health platform was developed. Intervention: during Week 1, participants received a pedometer and a personalized consultation with a dietitian and an exercise physiologist. For 12 weeks, participants logged on to the e-health Web site to access personal step goals, nutrition education videos, and a discussion board. Follow-up occurred at Week 13. <h3>Results</h3> Nine participants had a mean age of 67.5±6.7 years (60% women). Significant improvements were observed for fat mass (DXA), trunk fat mass, symptom severity (Swiss Symptom Scale), energy intake, maximum continuous activity (accelerometry), and mental health (SF-36) (p<.05). Nonsignificant improvements were observed for waist circumference, pain, ODI, and obesity biomarkers. Seventy percent lost weight, 50% increased walking capacity, and 60% increased quality of life. The mean increase in steps was 15%. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The spinal stenosis pedometer and nutrition lifestyle intervention was shown to be feasible, attractive to participants, and effective in this small sample. This intervention provides people with LSS the opportunity to participate in their own health management, potentially improving access to care. Efficacy is currently being assessed in a randomized trial.",0

Abolished proinflammatory lymphocyte function is associated with higher risk of infection and postoperative complications. We hypothesized that thoracic epidural anaesthesia (TEA) reduces intraoperative stress and thus attenuates lymphocyte decrease and impairment of proinflammatory lymphocyte function.Fifty-four patients undergoing major abdominal surgery who had a thoracic epidural catheter inserted were studied. In the TEA-I group, this catheter was used for intraoperative analgesia, whereas the TEA-P group received systemic opioids during surgery. In both groups, patient-controlled epidural analgesia was used for postoperative pain management. Blood samples for immune analyses were obtained before induction of anaesthesia, 2 h after skin incision, and at days 1 and 4 after surgery. Lymphocyte subpopulations, expression of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR on monocytes, plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-10, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and IL-12, and concanavalin-A-stimulated concentrations of IFN-gamma and IL-10 were measured. Intraoperative data including bispectral index and plasma concentrations of epinephrine/cortisol were analysed; APACHE-II, SAPS II, and additional postoperative data were documented.Plasma concentrations of epinephrine and cortisol were significantly lower in the TEA-I patients during surgery. IFN-gamma/IL-10 ratio was significantly higher in the TEA-I group from 2 h after skin incision until day 1. Lymphocyte numbers and T-helper cells were significantly higher in the TEA-I group at day 1, whereas no significant differences were detected among IL-12, HLA-DR, and postoperative clinical course.Intraoperative use of thoracic epidural catheter reduced stress response and prevented stress-induced perioperative impairment of proinflammatory lymphocyte function.",0

Treatment of osteoporosis has obtained mixed results. In this study we evaluate the effect of treatment with an oral bisphosphonate.Sixty-four patients with low mineral density 6 months after HTx were randomized as follows: Group A received oral clodronate (1600 mg/day in two divided doses), and Group B received placebo. Every patient was also treated with 2000 mg/day of oral calcium carbonate. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine, 1/3 and 1/10 of the distal nondominant forearm before and after 12 months of treatment. Laboratory tests were performed at 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment.All patients demonstrated manifest bone loss 6 months after HTx compared with normal non-HTx controls (P=0.0001). After 1 year of clodronate therapy, BMD at the lumbar spine increased from 0.77+/-1.4 g/cm(2) to 0.86 g/cm(2) (P=0.02). Laboratory tests did not show any significant variation, except for the bone isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase, which showed a significant decrease after 1 year of treatment.

The conservative treatment is proved to be effective for the majority of these patients, and the remaining patients are not ideal surgical candidates. Studies have found that minimally invasive percutaneous disk procedures may be preferable to open surgery in certain clinical situations. However, nucleoplasty in treating contained lumbar disk herniation and leg pain caused by radicular encroachment is still a controversy.A total of 97 patients with leg pain and MRI evidence of small-sized or medium-sized herniated disks correlating with the symptoms participated in the study. The patients were randomly allocated into 3 groups: the CT-guided nucleoplasty group (N=33), the CT-guided nucleoplasty with nerve root injection group (N=35), and CT-guided transforaminal lumbar epidural injections group (N=29). Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain score and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) values were applied at pretreatment and 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 12 months at posttreatment.There were statistically significant decreases (P=0.000) in the NRS and ODI scores for all posttreatment time points when compared with the pretreatment values in all the 3 groups. The average NRS and ODI results for the transforaminal lumbar epidural injections group were significantly higher than those for the other 2 groups at 3 and 12 months posttreatment (P<0.05). The combination of nucleoplasty with nerve root injection produced a significantly greater reduction in the NRS and ODI scores when compared with nucleoplasty at 1 week (P=0.000 for NRS and P=0.004 for ODI) and 1 month (P=0.000 for NRS and P=0.007 for ODI) after the treatment.The results of this study suggest that CT-guided nucleoplasty with radiofrequency energy is a relative effective and safe technique for treating leg pain caused by radicular encroachment. Furthermore, nucleoplasty combined with nerve root injection had achieved a significant greater improvement in pain management and functional level in short term (within 1 mo) after treatment than nucleoplasty alone.",0

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of coadministration of ketamine and clonidine on postoperative morphine consumption in patients after spine surgery. The patients undergoing spine surgery were allocated randomly to one of the four study groups, which are as follows: group M ( n = 12), intravenously (IV) administered patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine alone; group MK ( n = 12), IV-PCA morphine plus intra- and postoperative ketamine; group MC ( n = 13), IV-PCA morphine plus oral clonidine premedication; group MCK ( n = 12), IV-PCA morphine plus intra- and postoperative ketamine and clonidine premedication. The patients in the MC and MCK groups received 4 μg/kg clonidine orally, whereas those in the MK and MCK groups received IV bolus of ketamine (10 mg) at a rate of 2 mg/kg/hour during anesthesia. Patients were arranged to use IV-PCA mode for administration of drugs, which was programmed to deliver a bolus dose of 2-mg morphine (groups M and MC), or boluses of 2-mg morphine and 2-mg ketamine (groups MK and MCK). Scores of visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, morphine requirement, vital signs, nausea, sedation, and other side effects were followed up to 60 hours after surgery. Although there were significant differences in VAS pain scores at rest 24–48 hours after the surgery, the VAS pain score at movement was similar among the groups. The number of PCA request and cumulative morphine requirement were significantly lower in the MCK group than in the M group. This study results show that the administration of perioperative low-dose ketamine combined with clonidine premedication could reduce the consumption of postoperative PCA morphine following spine surgery.",0

Intubation using a luminous stylet, such as the Trachlight(R) (TL), also produces minimal motion of the c-spine and may be an interesting alternative technique for patients with an unstable c-spine. In this study, we compared the cervical motion caused by the TL and the FOB during intubation.Twenty patients with a normal c-spine undergoing general anesthesia, including neuromuscular blockade, for a neuroradiologic intervention were included in a prospective, randomized, controlled, nonblinded, crossover trial. Each patient was tracheally intubated sequentially with the TL and the FOB in a randomized order. Manual in-line stabilization was applied by an assistant during intubation. The motions produced by intubation from the occiput (C0) to C5 were recorded in the sagittal plane using continuous cinefluoroscopy. For movement analysis, the recordings were divided into four stages: ""baseline"" before intubation began; ""introduction"" of the intubation device; ""intubation"" (passage of the tube through the vocal cords); and ""removal"" of the device. For each intubating device, the average maximal segmental motion observed in every patient at any stage or cervical segment was calculated and compared using Student's t-test. The time required to intubate with each device was also compared.There was no significant difference in the mean maximum segmental motion produced during intubation with the TL versus the FOB (12 degrees +/- 6 degrees vs 11 degrees +/- 5 degrees ; P = 0.5). Segmental movements occurred predominantly at the C0-1 and C1-2 levels, and maximal movements were observed during the introduction stage in 18/20 patients for both devices. Intubation took less time with the TL (34 +/- 17 vs 60 +/- 15 s, P < 0.001).In patients under general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade and manual in-line stabilization, we found no difference in the segmental c-spine motion produced during endotracheal intubation using the FOB and the TL.",0

Although prior study has determined relative risk and odds ratio values to quantify risk factors, these values may be difficult to translate to the patient during counseling of surgical options. Ideally, a model that predicts absolute risk of medical complication, rather than relative risk or odds ratio values, would greatly enhance the discussion of safety of spine surgery. To date, there is no risk stratification model that specifically predicts the risk of medical complication.The purpose of this study was to create and validate a predictive model for the risk of medical complication during and after spine surgery.Statistical analysis using a prospective surgical spine registry that recorded extensive demographic, surgical, and complication data. Outcomes examined are medical complications that were specifically defined a priori. This analysis is a continuation of statistical analysis of our previously published report.Using a prospectively collected surgical registry of more than 1,476 patients with extensive demographic, comorbidity, surgical, and complication detail recorded for 2 years after surgery, we previously identified several risk factor for medical complications. Using the beta coefficients from those log binomial regression analyses, we created a model to predict the occurrence of medical complication after spine surgery. We split our data into two subsets for internal and cross-validation of our model. We created two predictive models: one predicting the occurrence of any medical complication and the other predicting the occurrence of a major medical complication.The final predictive model for any medical complications had a receiver operator curve characteristic of 0.76, considered to be a fair measure. The final predictive model for any major medical complications had receiver operator curve characteristic of 0.81, considered to be a good measure. The final model has been uploaded for use on SpineSage.com.We present a validated model for predicting medical complications after spine surgery. The value in this model is that it gives the user an absolute percent likelihood of complication after spine surgery based on the patient's comorbidity profile and invasiveness of surgery. Patients are far more likely to understand an absolute percentage, rather than relative risk and confidence interval values. A model such as this is of paramount importance in counseling patients and enhancing the safety of spine surgery. In addition, a tool such as this can be of great use particularly as health care trends toward pay-for-performance, quality metrics, and risk adjustment. To facilitate the use of this model, we have created a website (SpineSage.com) where users can enter in patient data to determine likelihood of medical complications after spine surgery.",0

A total of 100 participants were included, with 50 participants in each of the local anesthetic and steroid groups. All of the participants met the diagnostic criteria of thoracic facet joint pain by means of comparative, controlled diagnostic blocks and the inclusion criteria. Group I participants received thoracic medial branch blocks with bupivacaine, whereas Group II participants received thoracic medial branch blocks with bupivacaine and non-particulate betamethasone.Outcomes measures included numeric rating scores (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), opioid intake, and return to work status at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Significant pain relief was defined as >/= 50% pain relief and/or a positive change in ODI scores.In Group I and Group II 90% of participants showed significant pain relief and functional improvement at 12 months.

A prospective randomized study,"Regional epidural analgesia is considered the gold standard for pain treatment in labor. However, epidural catheter placement may be a challenging procedure because of the difficulty in the palpation of anatomical landmarks, particularly in pregnant women. Pre-procedural neuroaxial ultrasound may facilitate the procedure.A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted in a labor ward. Two groups of women undergoing epidural analgesia were randomized: Group A (N.=28), which was subjected to the loss of resistance technique, and Group B (N.=30) which was subjected to an ultrasound (US)-assisted procedure. The real depth of epidural space was calculated in both groups by measuring the needle skin-to-tip distance, while the US depth was measured only in Group B.The mean number of attempts in group A (3.43±3.8) was significantly higher than in Group B (1.70±0.87, P=0.019). Analysis of data from Group B revealed a strong positive correlation between the epidural real depth and US depth (r=0.88, P<0.0001).The US-assisted technique for epidural catheter placement for labor analgesia is safe, effective, easy to perform, and is a valuable aid to improve the identification of the epidural space compared with the palpation of anatomical landmarks and the loss of resistance technique. Pre-puncture ultrasound assessment shows the exact location of the intervertebral space, the optimal point of insertion and the tilt angle of the needle, the depth of the epidural space and any anatomical abnormalities of the spine, thereby increasing the success rate and reducing procedural complications of the blind approach.",0

However, disadvantages of these immobilization devices in terms of discomfort and tissue-interface pressures have guided the development of soft-layered long spineboards. We compared tissue-interface pressures between awake and anaesthetized (unconscious) patients during immobilization on a rigid spineboard and a soft-layered long spineboard.In this comparative study, 30 anaesthetized patients were randomized to immobilization on either the rigid spineboard or the soft-layered spineboard for the duration of their elective surgery. Tissue-interface pressures measured using an Xsensor pressure-mapping device were compared with those of 30 healthy volunteers who were immobilized sequentially on the rigid spineboard and the soft-layered spineboard. Redness of the sacrum was also recorded for the anaesthetized patients immediately after the surgery.For both anaesthetized patients and awake volunteers, tissue-interface pressures were significantly lower on the soft-layered spineboard than on the rigid spineboard, both at start and after 15min. On the soft-layered spineboard, tissue interface pressure and peak pressure index (PPI) for the sacrum were significantly lower for anaesthetized patients than for awake volunteers. Peak pressures and PPI on the rigid spineboard were equal for both groups. Tissue-interface pressures did not change significantly over time. Redness of the sacrum was significantly more pronounced on the rigid spineboard than on the soft-layered spineboard.This prospective randomized controlled trial shows that using a soft-layered spineboard compared to a rigid spineboard for spinal immobilization resulted in lower tissue-interface pressures in both awake volunteers and anaesthetized patients. Moreover, tissue-interface pressures on the soft-layered spineboard were lower in anaesthetized patients than in awake volunteers. These findings show the importance of using a soft-layered spineboard to reduce tissue-interface pressure, especially for patients who cannot relieve pressure themselves by changing position.",0

We have developed a novel formulation of magnesium chloride (MgCl₂) within PEG, and have previously demonstrated the neuroprotective benefit of this formulation in animal models of thoracic SCI.Twenty-two Sprague Dawley rats underwent a unilateral cervical hemicontusion at C4-C5 and were randomized 2 hours later to either the MgCl₂ in PEG formulation, or normal saline. Each treatment was administered in 5 intravenous infusions spaced 6 hours apart. Behavioral recovery was assessed over 6 weeks, after which the cord was analyzed to measure the extent of gray matter and white matter sparing through the injury site.In the horizontal ladder test, the percentage of forelimb errors made by the animals treated with MgCl₂ in PEG formulation was significantly lower than the saline-treated controls. Histologic analysis also revealed a significantly higher cumulative white matter sparing through the injury site in the MgCl₂ in PEG group.MgCl₂ in a PEG formulation reduced secondary damage and improved behavioral recovery when administered 2 hours after a unilateral cervical hemicontusion injury. These findings are consistent with the neurologic benefit observed when administering this magnesium formulation in contusive and compressive models of thoracic SCI. Demonstrating the robustness of this neuroprotective effect in multiple injury models (and in the cervical injury model in particular) is important when considering the applicability of such a therapy for human SCIs.",0

Two quadripolar leads were implanted epidurally over the primary motor (M1) and premotor cortices, contralateral to the most dystonic side. The leads were placed parallel to the central sulcus. Only the posterior lead over M1 was activated in this study. The most lateral or medial contact of the lead (depending on whether the dystonia predominated in the upper or lower limb) was selected as the anode, and the other 3 as cathodes. One month postoperatively, patients were randomly assigned to on- or off-stimulation for 3 months each, with a 1-month washout between the 2 conditions. Voltage, frequency, and pulse width were fixed at 3.8 V, 40 Hz, and 60 μs, respectively. Evaluations of dystonia (Burke-Fahn-Marsden Scale), spasticity (Ashworth score), pain intensity (visual analog scale), and quality of life (36-Item Short Form Health Survey) were performed before surgery and after each period of stimulation.Burke-Fahn-Marsden Scale, Ashworth score, pain intensity, and quality of life were not statistically significantly modified by MCS.Bipolar epidural MCS failed to improve any clinical feature in dystonia secondary to a focal BG lesion.This study provides Class I evidence that bipolar epidural MCS with the anode placed over the motor representation of the most affected limb failed to improve any clinical feature in dystonia secondary to a focal BG lesion.",0

Despite its overall success, LLIF has been associated with a unique set of complications. However, there has been inconsistent evidence regarding the complication rate of this approach.To perform a systematic review analyzing the rates of medical and surgical complications associated with LLIF.Systematic review.6,819 patients who underwent LLIF reported in clinical studies through June 2016.Frequency of complications within cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, urologic, gastrointestinal, transient neurologic, persistent neurologic, and spine (MSK) categories.This systematic review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Relevant studies that identified rates of any complication following LLIF procedures were obtained from PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases. Articles were excluded if they did not report complications, presented mixed complication data from other procedures, or were characterized as single case reports, reviews, or case series containing less than 10 patients. The primary outcome was frequency of complications within cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, urologic, gastrointestinal, transient neurologic, persistent neurologic, and MSK categories. All rates of complications were based on the sample sizes of studies that mentioned the respective complications. The authors report no conflicts of interest directly or indirectly related to this work, and have not received any funds in support of this work.A total of 2,232 articles were identified. Following screening of title, abstract, and full-text availability, 63 articles were included in the review. A total of 6,819 patients had 11,325 levels fused. The rate of complications for the categories included were as follows: wound (1.38%; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.00%-1.85%), cardiac (1.86%; CI=1.33%-2.52%), vascular (0.81%; CI=0.44%-1.36%), pulmonary (1.47; CI=0.95%-2.16%), gastrointestinal (1.38%; CI=1.00%-1.87%), urologic (0.93%; CI=0.55%-1.47%), transient neurologic (36.07%; CI=34.74%-37.41%), persistent neurologic (3.98%; CI=3.42%-4.60%), and MSK or spine (9.22%; CI=8.28%-10.23%).The current study is the first to comprehensively analyze the complication profile for LLIFs. The most significant reported complications were transient neurologic in nature. However, persistent neurologic complications occurred at a much lower rate, bringing into question the significance of transient symptoms beyond the immediate postoperative period. Through this analysis of complication profiles, surgeons can better understand the risks to and expectations for patients following LLIF procedures.",0

Pain, nausea, and urinary retention may delay discharge. It was hypothesized that intraoperative ketorolac or bupivacaine would reduce postoperative pain as measured by morphine demand.After Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and informed consent, 30 patients undergoing single-level microsurgical lumbar discectomy under general anesthesia randomly received either intravenous ketorolac, intramuscular bupivacaine, or placebo before wound closure. After surgery, all patients received intravenous, MSO4, patient-controlled analgesia. MSO4 demand was compared between groups at 30 minutes and at 1, 4, 8, 16, 20, and 24 hours after surgery by one-way ANOVA. Pre- and postoperative pain was assessed by using a standard scale and was correlated to postoperative MSO4 demand by Pearson correlation. Significance was assumed at P < 0.05.There were no group differences in age, gender, weight, disc level, preoperative pain, or preoperative use of pain medication.

Denosumab significantly increased bone mineral density to a degree similar to that observed in the overall analysis for every subgroup including older men as well as those with prevalent fractures, lower baseline bone mineral density, and higher serum C-telopeptide and tartrate-resistant alkaline phosphatase 5b. Mean increases in bone mineral density at each skeletal site were greatest for men with the highest levels of serum C-telopeptide and tartrate-resistant alkaline phosphatase 5b.Denosumab significantly and consistently increased bone mineral density at all skeletal sites and in every subgroup, including men at greatest risk for bone loss and fractures.",0

Jingshu Keli (JSKL), a traditional Chinese medicine formula with multiple active compounds, has been prescribed for pain management in patients with cervical radiculopathy for decades. Two major components of JSKL, ferulic acid and cinnamaldehyde, were identified to have anti-inflammation effect via inhibiting activation of Stat3.To investigate the efficacy of JSKL by investigating its mechanism in attenuating cervical radiculopathy-induced mechanical allodynia via modulation activation of spinal microglia and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3).An in vivo animal experiment.Cervical radiculopathy of rats was established by C7 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) with 6-0 silk suture. The effect of postoperational daily gavage of JSKL on mechanical allodynia of rats was tested on day 3, 7, and 14 after surgery. Furthermore, spinal glial cells activation and phosphorylation of Stat3 (p-Stat3) were tested with immunofluorescence imaging and Western blot.The JSKL significantly inhibited SNL-induced allodynia as well as microglia activation in the spinal cord on day 7 and 14 after surgery. Moreover, expression of p-Stat3 was decreased in rats with SNL and JSKL treatment in comparison with rats with SNL and vehicle treatment.The JSKL attenuated SNL-induced mechanical allodynia in rats. This analgesic effect might be explained by the suppression of activations of spinal microglia as well as p-Stat3. Our study provides experimental evidence for JSKL as an alternative approach to manage refractory pain in patients with cervical radiculopathy.",0

In this series, 156 patients underwent surgery with distraction and fusion using Harrington rods, and 127 were treated with brace.To determine the long-term outcome in terms of radiologic findings and curve progression at least 20 years after completion of the treatment.Radiologic appearance is important in comparing the outcome of different treatment options and in evaluating clinical results. Earlier studies have shown a slight increase of the Cobb angle in brace-treated patients with time, but not in fused patients.Of 283 patients, 252 attended a clinical and radiologic follow-up assessment by an unbiased observer (91% of the surgically treated and 87% of the brace-treated patients). This evaluation included chart reviews, validated questionnaires, clinical examination, and full-length standing frontal and lateral roentgenographs. Curve size was measured by the Cobb method on anteroposterior roentgenograms as well as by sagittal contour and balance on lateral films. The occurrence of any degenerative changes or other complications was noted. An age- and gender-matched control group of 100 individuals was randomly selected and subjected to the same examinations.The mean follow-up times were 23 years for surgically treated group and 22 years for brace-treated group. The deterioration of the curves was 3.5 degrees for all the surgically treated curves and 7.9 degrees for all the brace-treated curves (P < 0.001). Five patients, all brace-treated, had a curve increase of 20 degrees or more. The overall complication rate after surgery was low: Pseudarthrosis occurred in three patients, and flat back syndrome developed in four patients. Eight of the patients treated with fusion (5.1%) had undergone some additional curve-related surgical procedure. The lumbar lordosis was less in the surgically treated than in the brace-treated patients or the control group (mean, 33 degrees vs 45 degrees and 44 degrees, respectively). Both surgically treated and brace-treated patients had more degenerative disc changes than the control participants (P < 0.001), but no significant differences were found between the scoliosis groups. No statistically significant difference in terms of radiographically detectable degenerative changes in the unfused lumbar discs was found between patients fused below L3 or those fused to L3 and above (P = 0.22). A study on intra- and interobserver measurements of kyphosis, lordosis, and sagittal vertical axis on two films for each patient demonstrated that the repeatability of measuring sagittal plumbline on two different lateral radiographs, with patients moving between radiograms, was unreliable for comparison.Although more than 20 years had passed since completion of the treatment, most of the curves did not increase. The surgical complication rate was low. Degenerative disc changes were more common in both patient groups than in the control group.",0

However, independent validation and extension to thoracic MRIs are needed.We prospectively examined 178 consecutive patients with CIEDs who underwent 212 MRI scans (62 with implantable cardioverter/defibrillators) for clinical reasons between February 2014 and August 2016. Scans were done in standard modes with a limit of 2 W/kg. Pacing modes were ODO or OVO for intrinsic rates > 40 and DOO or VOO for rates ≤ 40. Patients were cleared prescan by both radiology and cardiology, and pre- and postscan CIED interrogations were performed. Primary outcome events were death and generator or lead failure. Secondary events included battery voltage loss > 0.04 V, decrease in P wave voltage > 50% or R wave voltage > 25%, threshold increase of > 0.5 V, and impedance change > 50 Ω. Scan sites were 87 (41%) C-spine/head/neck, 28 (13%) T-spine/cardiac/shoulder (thoracic), 69 (33%) L-spine/abdomen/pelvis, and 28 (13%) lower extremity. No primary or secondary outcome events occurred, and no periscan disruption of pacing was noted.In a real-world MRI experience in patients with CIEDs representing a broad range of models, types, and scan sites (including thoracic scans), no adverse safety signals were noted. This experience validates and extends that of the large but inclusion-restricted MagnaSafe Registry, profiles MRI scanning in CIED patients in general clinical practice, and argues against replacing nonconditional with conditional devices when MRI is performed in a carefully controlled environment.",0

Objective To identify predictive clinical parameters for a diagnosis of axial SpA in patients with chronic back pain presenting in primary care. Methods Consecutive patients aged &lt;45 years (n=950) with back pain for &gt;2 months who presented to orthopaedic surgeons (n=143) were randomised based on four key questions for referral to rheumatologists (n=36) for diagnosis. Results The rheumatologists saw 322 representative patients (mean age 36 years, 50% female, median duration of back pain 30 months). 113 patients (35%) were diagnosed as axial SpA (62% HLA B27+), 47 (15%) as ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 66 (21%) as axial non-radiographic SpA (nrSpA). Age at onset ≤35 years, improvement by exercise, improvement with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, waking up in the second half of the night and alternating buttock pain were identified as most relevant for diagnosing axial SpA by multiple regression analysis. Differences between AS and nrSpA were detected. No single item was predictive, but ≥3 items proved useful for good sensitivity and specificity by receiver operating characteristic modelling. Conclusion This study shows that a preselection in primary care of patients with back pain based on a combination of clinical items is useful to facilitate the diagnosis of axial SpA.",0

Several authors have reported improved survival among elderly patients with C2 fractures when treated surgically.We aimed to analyze whether surgery improves survival of elderly with C2 fractures.An observational population-based longitudinal multi-registry study was carried out.Swedish Patient Registry 1997 to 2014 and Swedish Cause of Death Registry 1997 to 2014 served as source of patient sample.Survival after C2 fracture according to non-surgical and surgical treatment was the outcome measure.We included all patients treated for the primary diagnosis of C2 fracture (10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems or ICD-10: S12.1) at an age ≥70 years and receiving treatment at a health-care facility. Non-surgical treatment comprises cervical collar or halo-vest treatment. Surgical treatment was identified in the Swedish patient registry extract using the Swedish classification of procedural codes. Survival was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comorbidity was determined using the Charlson Comorbidity Index.Of the included 3,375 elderly patients with C2 fractures (43% men, aged 83±7 years), 22% were treated surgically. Surgical treatment was assigned based on age, gender, and year of treatment. The 1-year survival of 2,618 non-surgically treated patients was 72% (n=1,856), and 81% (n=614) for the 757 surgically treated (p<.001, relative risk reduction=11%). Adjusted for age, gender, comorbidity, and year of injury, surgically treated patients had greater survival than non-surgically treated patients (hazard ratio=0.88, 95% confidence interval: 0.79-0.97). Among those above 88 years of age (95% confidence interval: 85-92), surgical treatment lost its effect on survival.Despite the frailty of elderly patients, the morbidity of cervical external immobilization with a rigid collar seemingly weighs greater than surgical morbidity, even in octogenarians. For those above 88 years of age, non-surgical treatment should be primarily attempted.",0

Identifying patients likely to respond remains a challenge since mobilizations' mechanism(s) of action are unclear.Medline, Web of Science, Cinahl, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched for relevant studies. Reference lists of included studies were hand searched. Studies were included if the intervention was passive spinal mobilizations, participants were symptomatic, and outcomes evaluated possible mechanisms of action. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two assessors using a modified Cochrane Back Review Group tool.Twenty-four studies were included in the review. Four were classified high risk, 14 moderate risk, and four low risk of bias. Commonest methodological limitations were lack of participant blinding, adequate randomization and allocation concealment, and sample size calculation. Evidence suggests that spinal mobilizations cause neurophysiological effects resulting in hypoalgesia (local and/or distal to mobilization site), sympathoexcitation, and improved muscle function. Mobilizations have no effect on temperature pain threshold. Three of four studies reported reduction in spinal stiffness, heterogeneous in location and timing. There is limited evidence (one study in each case) to suggest that mobilizations produce increased nociceptive flexion reflex threshold, improved posture, decreased concentration of substance P in saliva, and improved sway index measured in cervical extension. Evidence does not support an effect on segmental vertebral movement. Two studies investigated correlations between hypoalgesia and mechanism: one found a correlation with sympathoexcitatory changes, whereas the other found no correlation with change in stiffness.These findings suggest involvement of an endogenous pain inhibition system mediated by the central nervous system, although this is yet to be investigated directly. There is limited evidence regarding other possible mechanisms.3.",0

The role of an immunosuppressive-induced hypogonadism, a well-known cause of osteoporosis in men and its prevention are less defined after HTx. The aim of this study was first, to evaluate the incidence of hypogonadism after HTx and its influence on bone mineral metabolism and second, to assess the effect of a testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal transplants.Due to hormonal status, 88 male cardiac transplants were randomised to a normogonadal or hypogonadal group. At baseline as well as after 1 and 2 years bone mineral density (BMD g/cm (2), T-score) was measured at the lumbar spine with DEXA. All patients received a basic therapy of calcium and vitamin D. The hypogonadal patients received additional testosterone.21 patients (24 %) showed an age-independent hypogonadism. Hypogonadal transplants showed a significant lower BMD (p < 0.001) (BMD = 0.8070 g/cm (2), T-value = -2.6514) than normogonadal patients (BMD = 0.9882 g/cm (2), T-value = -1.0568). Despite testosterone replacement hypogonadal patients showed no significant additional increase in BMD over 1 - 2 years compared with the normogonadal.Male cardiac transplants in all age groups show an high prevalence of hypogonadism (approximately 25 %) which contributes to a significant bone loss. An additional testosterone substitution did not significantly increase BMD.",0

Custom software and time-consuming manual segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is required for quantitative analysis and presents as a barrier for clinical translation.The purpose of this work was to establish a qualitative MRI measure for MFI and evaluate its ability to differentiate between individuals with severe whiplash-associated disorder (WAD), mild or moderate WAD, and healthy controls.This is a cross-sectional study.Thirty-one subjects with WAD and 31 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited from an ongoing randomized controlled trial.The cervical multifidus was visually identified and segmented into eighths in the axial fat/water images (C4-C7). Muscle fat infiltration was assessed on a visual scale: 0 for no or marginal MFI, 1 for light MFI, and 2 for distinct MFI. The participants with WAD were divided in two groups: mild or moderate and severe based on Neck Disability Index % scores.The mean regional MFI was compared between the healthy controls and each of the WAD groups using the Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses were carried out to evaluate the validity of the qualitative method.Twenty (65%) patients had mild or moderate disability and 11 (35%) were considered severe. Inter- and intra-rater reliability was excellent when grading was averaged by level or when frequency of grade II was considered. Statistically significant differences (p<.05) in regional MFI were particularly notable between the severe WAD group and healthy controls. The ROC curve, based on detection of distinct MFI, showed an area-under-the curve of 0.768 (95% confidence interval 0.59-0.94) for discrimination of WAD participants.These preliminary results suggest a qualitative MRI measure for MFI is reliable and valid, and may prove useful toward the classification of WAD in radiology practice.",0

Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator has estrogen-like effects on bone tissue, and antagonize the action of estrogens on endometrium and breast tissue. It is unknown if the treatment of osteoporosis with raloxifene has estrogen-like or opposite effects on back pain and functional capacity among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. A total of 120 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and chronic back pain were randomized to receive raloxifene 60 mg with 1,000 mg calcium, and 800 IU vitamin D daily or 1,000 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D daily. Pain intensity and pain-related disability were measured before treatment at 6 months and after 1 year. Repeated measures of ANOVA, did not reveal statistically significant differences over time, on pain intensity and disability scores, between groups studied. There was a trend in pain intensity changes during the follow-up period, but the differences between the groups were not statistically significant. It seems that treatment with raloxifene does not influence back pain and disability among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Raloxifene may have estrogenic agonist effects on nociceptive processing in the central nervous system.",0

The diagnostic accuracy of real-time PCR was analyzed based on the definitive diagnosis of infection, defined as a positive result from microbiological culture or histopathology. <h3>Results</h3> All six control subjects were negative for PSI for all analyses. Twelve clinically suspect PSI subjects received definitive diagnoses (PSI group). The non-PSI group consisted of six control subjects plus the remaining 20 patients from the PSI clinically suspect group. MRS-PCR results were positive for all MRS-cultured PSI subjects. U-PCR was positive for all subjects in the PSI group with one discrepancy between real-time PCR and microbiological culture results in differentiation between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In the non-PSI group, MRS-PCR and U-PCR were positive in three and seven cases, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of MRS-PCR for diagnosing MRS infection were 1.00, 0.91, 0.57, and 1.00, respectively; those for the diagnosis of bacterial infection with U-PCR were 1.00, 0.73, 0.63, and 1.00, respectively. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Identification of MRS infection and ability to differentiate between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is rapidly achieved using MRS-PCR and U-PCR.

The flexion relaxation phenomenon is commonly measured in LBP patients; however, there is insufficient evidence about the changes in this measure following an intervention.Fifteen subjects with chronic LBP (7 females, 8 males) performed a 12-week training intervention. The main outcome measures were the Oswestry disability index, visual analog scale, and flexion relaxation response analyzed by the raw electromyograph (EMG) signal, the relative EMG signal, and the flexion relaxation ratio.Disability and pain scores improved significantly after the 12-week intervention. There were no changes in the active components of the flexion relaxation measurement but an approximate 67% decrease in the amount of activity measured during the relaxation phase at full trunk flexion.The data suggest that afferent feedback changes may be explaining why there is improved electrical relaxation following an exercise intervention.",0

Patients were classified as leg pain predominant, LBP predominant, or having equal pain according to baseline pain scores. Baseline characteristics were compared between the 3 predominant pain location groups within each diagnostic category, and changes in surgical and nonoperative outcome scores were compared for 2 years. Longitudinal regression models including baseline covariates were used to control for confounders.Among DS patients at baseline, 34% had predominant leg pain, 26% had predominant LBP, and 40% had equal pain. Similarly, 32% of SpS patients had predominant leg pain, 26% had predominant LBP, and 42% had equal pain. DS and SpS patients with predominant leg pain had baseline scores indicative of less severe symptoms. Leg pain predominant DS and SpS patients treated surgically improved significantly more than LBP predominant patients on all primary outcome measures at 1 and 2 years. Surgical outcomes for the equal pain groups were intermediate to those of the predominant leg pain and LBP groups. The differences in nonoperative outcomes were less consistent. Conclusion. Predominant leg pain patients improved significantly more with surgery than predominant LBP patients. However, predominant LBP patients still improved significantly more with surgery than with nonoperative treatment.",0

We have examined this hypothesis using a genetic strategy. The -174C (rather than G) IL-6 gene variant is associated with lower IL-6 expression. As such, we might anticipate the C allele to be associated with a greater response to HRT. We have tested this hypothesis. Mean three-site [spine (L1-L4), neck of femur, and Ward's triangle] BMD was measured in 65 women in a 1-year randomised controlled trial of HRT with 0.625 mg oestrogen/day and 0.15 mg norgestrel (n=30). Baseline BMD was genotype-independent for both the control and HRT group. In the control group, the percentage change in BMD after 1 year was similar between genotypes (P=0.45). In contrast, in the HRT group, the rise was genotype-dependent. Those homozygous for the G allele showed a 3.62 (2.14)% increase in BMD compared with 10.44 (4.68)% for the C-homozygous group. Heterozygotes had an intermediate BMD increase of 5.6 (2.82)% [ P=0.006 ( P value for interaction between HRT and genotype was 0.04)] Although the study was limited by its small sample size, these are the first data to demonstrate the importance of IL-6 genotype in determining response to oestrogen therapy, rather than its physiological withdrawal.",0

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of combination therapy with teriparaide and denosumab on spinal fusion after posterior lumbar interbody fusion.Sixteen osteoporotic patients with lumbar canal stenosis were randomly divided into two treatment groups, a teriparatide group (n=8; 20μg of teriparatide daily alone, administered from a month before surgery to 12 months after surgery) and a combination group (n=8; 20μg of teriparatide administered daily from a month before surgery to 12 months after surgery with 60mg denosumab every 6 months, administered at 2 and 8 months following surgery). All patients underwent posterior lumbar interbody fusion with local bone grafts. At 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following surgery, bone mineral density at the femoral neck was measured, and biochemical markers were obtained for bone turnover for all cases. Clinical findings were quantified using the Japanese Orthopedic Association scores before surgery, and at 6 and 12 months following surgery. Fusion rates were measured using computed tomography images before surgery, and 6 and 12 months following surgery.Alkaline phosphatase in the teriparatide group increased more than in the combination group at 3 months following surgery (p<0.05). Femoral neck BMD increased more in the combination group than in the teriparatide group at 12 months following surgery. The combination group achieved higher fusion rates than the teriparatide group at 6 months following surgery.Combination therapy with teriparatide and denosumab increased bone mineral density more than teriparatide alone, and accelerated spinal fusion following posterior lumbar interbody fusion.",0

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of laser irradiation of the dorsal root ganglion of the second lumbar spinal nerve for chronic axial low back pain compared to lidocaine injection and radiofrequency treatment.Twenty-eight patients were randomly divided into three treatment groups: lidocaine injection, radiofrequency, or laser. The second intervertebral foramen between the second and third lumbar vertebrae was accessed by percutaneous needle puncture bilaterally, guided by fluoroscopy. In the local anesthetic group, injection of 1 ml lidocaine without epinephrine was applied through a 20-gauge (G20) Quincke tip spinal needle inserted in the second lumbar intervertebral foramen. In the radiofrequency group, the probe (150 mm long with a 5 mm active tip) was directed through a G20 needle placed in the second lumbar intervertebral foramen and neuromodulation was done with a radiofrequency of Cosman G4® in pulses of 20 ms with wash-out period of 480 ms, for 300 seconds at 42°C. A single treatment was used. In the laser treatment group, a continuous wave, 808 nm wavelength diode laser (Photon Lase III® DCM, Brazil), with an output power of 100 mW was used for a single treatment. An 18 gauge needle was placed in the second lumbar intervertebral foramen guided by fluoroscopy. Light was delivered through a 600 µm optical fiber placed in the G18 needle. The tip of the fiber extended 5 mm beyond the tip of the needle in the second lumbar intervertebral foramen.

The low back pain score was assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS) and Pain Relief Scale (PRS) pre, post procedure and in 1 month follow up. Temperature was measured using a digital thermometer.All patients in the local anesthetic and laser treatment groups reported a pain reduction of at least 50% immediately post-procedure and 10 out of 11 patients in the radiofrequency group reported a pain reduction of at least 50%. At 1 month post-treatment, the laser treatment group had the greatest number of patients who reported more than 50% pain relief based on PRS (7 out of 10 patients) while only 2 out of 7 patients and 3 out of 11 patients in the lidocaine and radiofrequency treatment groups respectively reported more than a 50% pain relief.Laser irradiation caused an immediate decrease in low back pain post-procedure similar to pain reduction caused by lidocaine injection. Both lidocaine injection and laser irradiation were more effective than radiofrequency treatment for immediate and longer term (1 month post-treatment) chronic back pain. Lasers Surg.

Cortical thickness at the tibia also increased more in the combination group (8.1% ± 4.3%) than both other groups (P < .001). Cortical porosity at both the radius and tibia increased progressively over the 24-month treatment period in the teriparatide group but was stable in both other groups (P < .001 teriparatide vs both other groups). Trabecular vBMD at the tibia increased similarly in all groups, whereas radius trabecular vBMD increased more in the combination group than the other groups (P < .01 for both comparisons). Finite element analysis-estimated strength improved or was maintained by all treatments at both the radius and tibia.Two years of combined teriparatide and denosumab improves bone microarchitecture and estimated strength more than the individual treatments, particularly in cortical bone. These findings suggest that this regimen may be beneficial in postmenopausal osteoporosis.",0

A blind randomized crossover-design study was conducted to quantitatively compare the intervertebral disc spaces between axial and anterior lean cervical traction in sitting position. A total of 96 radiographic images from the baseline measurements, axial and anterior lean tractions in 32 asymptomatic subjects were digitized for further analysis. The intra- and inter-examiner reliabilities for measuring the intervertebral disc spaces were in good ranges (ICCs = 0.928-0.942). With the application of anterior lean traction, the statistical increases were detected both in anterior and in posterior disc spaces compared to the baseline (0.29 mm and 0.24 mm; both P < 0.01) and axial traction (0.16 mm and 0.35 mm; both P < 0.01). The greater intervertebral disc spaces obtained during anterior lean traction might be associated with the more even distribution of traction forces over the anterior and posterior neck structures. The neck extension moment through mandible that generally occurred in the axial traction could be counteracted by the downward force of head weight during anterior lean traction. This study quantitatively demonstrated that anterior lean traction in sitting position provided more intervertebral disc space enlargements in both anterior and posterior aspects than axial traction did. These findings may serve as a therapeutic reference when cervical traction is suggested.",0

SEMG signals from the bilateral tibialis anterior and lateral gastrocnemius were measured. The root mean square (RMS), the RMS peak time, the mean power frequency (MPF), and the median frequency (MF) were analyzed. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values were calculated separately. The areas under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the kappa value were used to evaluate the accuracy of the SEMG diagnostic model.The accuracy of the SEMG model ranged from 85.71% to 100%, with an average of 93.57%. The sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and kappa value of the logistic regression model were 0.98 ± 0.05, 0.92 ± 0.09, 0.95 ± 0.04 (P = 0.006), and 0.87 ± 0.11, respectively (P = 0.001).

METHODS: Patients scheduled to undergo cervical spine surgery were assigned randomly into one of three groups: maintenance of anesthesia with fentanyl and propofol TCI (group FP, n = 25); maintenance with fentanyl and supplementation with less than 1% sevoflurane (group Fs, n = 25); and maintenance solely with sevoflurane (group S, n = 25). The severity of bucking, extent of awareness during neurological examination, and perception of pain during the emergence phase were assessed using predetermined scoring scales by a nurse blinded to the method of anesthesia. RESULTS: The bucking score and pain score were significantly better in group FP and group Fs than in the group S, whereas there was no significant difference between the data of group FP and group Fs. CONCLUSION: The quality of emergence from anesthesia in patients with cervical spine surgery is improved with fentanyl-based anesthesia, but there is no difference between the use of propofol TCI and less than 1% sevoflurane as a concomitant sedative agent with fentanyl.",0

It reduces blood loss, avoid pressure necrosis, and nerve injuries, and it provides a more comfortable postoperative period. Prone and knee-chest positions are mostly used positions in lumbar discectomy; hemodynamic and respiratory effects of spinal anesthesia and the differences between these 2 positions in spinal anesthesia were evaluated in this study, which only been evaluated in general anesthesia.Forty-five patients were randomized for lumbar microdiscectomy with spinal anesthesia under either prone position (group 1 n = 22) or knee-chest position (group 2 n = 23). All patients were classified as physical status 1 or 2 according to the American Association of Anesthesiology. Spinal anesthesia was performed with hyperbaric bupivacaine. Perioperative continuous hemodynamics and respiratory function test results were recorded after the spinal anesthesia was performed.Immediately after the spinal anesthesia was performed, both the systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure values were significantly decreased and heart rates were significantly increased in both groups. Both positions showed significant decrease in forced vital capacity (P = 0.002) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (P = 0.0015) during the surgery respect to preoperative values. The decrease in peak expiratory flow (P = 0.011) and forced expiratory flow at the 25% of the pulmonary volume (P = 0.011) was significant in knee-chest position respect to prone position.In conclusion, spinal anesthesia is appropriate for lumbar disc surgery with respect to the hemodynamic parameters in both prone and knee-chest positions, however, in terms of pulmonary functions, the knee-chest position can cause a restrictive effect. Therefore this position should be used cautiously in higher-risk patients.",0

It is not true that Claus Manniche after the publishing of the paper has established a private clinic, but in June 2013 he has started a position as being responsible for the research activity in a private clinic, which specializes in treating patients with Modic changes who are not able to receive treatment in the national health system. We feel that this is confirmation of the results of the trial and that he should be praised for providing this service. A professor would not participate in any clinic if the study was not scientifically extremely sound and provide a treatment where this specific group of patients does experience meaningful improvement with conventional care. If Professor Claus Manniche did not support this treatment that would be rather more suspicious. An author of a Letter to the Editor has to obey same rules as authors of scientific papers. Postulations need to be proven. This letter is full of undocumented postulations. For example, SL states that on the website belonging to Modicklinikken.dk it says in Danish: ‘‘We can cure back pain...’’). This is the first of many incorrect postulations, because this clinic only concerns itself with patients with Modic changes and only writes about them. Furthermore, this wording is simply not present. Another faulty postulation is that SL claims that we write in our paper ‘‘the authors claim to have shown that AB (anarobi bacteria) is found quite frequently in degenerated discs’’. We do not claim any such thing. We have shown that bacteria have been found in extruded nucleus material in disc herniations. Disc degeneration is an extremely wide definition and we have not studied this. SL claims that we investigated ‘‘Whether AB would be present in degenerated discs removed surgically’’. We have not claimed any such thing. We investigated if any bacteria were present in the extruded herniated nucleus material. This is clearly stated in the title of the paper ‘‘Does nuclear tissue infected with bacteria following disc herniation lead to Modic changes in the adjacent vertebrae?’’. Furthermore, it is not true that we only looked for AB (anaerobic bacteria). In Table 1 it is clearly marked that the analysis was carried out for both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. SL wonders why we did not study the association between a possible presence of bacteria at baseline and presence of Modic changes, and he thinks that we miss out on this opportunity. I presume that this stems from his previous misunderstanding where he thinks that we studied ‘‘degenerated discs removed surgically’’. We only had permission from The Ethical Committee to remove the extruded herniated disc material, and this was also our only interest. Patients would naturally get rather upset if after a surgery for a lumbar disc herniation they were told that lumps of their disc were removed or worse as SL describes ‘‘degenerated discs removed surgically’’. SL’s conclusion is that the bacteria are present as a result of contamination. SL claims that ‘‘Furthermore, as this bacterium is apparently also present inside the body, contamination could conceivably come from the body fluids’’ and doubts that it would be possible to have surgery without contamination. Well, only 44 % had infected nuclear material so it is indeed possible to undergo surgery H. B. Albert (&) C.

We have shown in a previous study that histologic changes on muscular biopsy performed in the multifidus at the end of the surgical procedure were not modified by the use of cholinergic blockade during surgery.Twenty patients scheduled to undergo pedicle-screw enhanced L4-L5 arthrodesis were enrolled in this study. Ten patients received curare during anesthesia and 10 patients did not. MRI was obtained the day before the operation and at 6 months of follow-up on the same MR scanner. T1-weighted images were obtained in the axial plane. The 2 slices immediately proximal and distal to the pedicle screw construct on the postoperative MRI were selected. The corresponding slices were selected on the preoperative MRI. Each erector spinae on the 4 slices was surrounded using a mouse-guided tool. The contractile component of the cross-sectional area (CCSA) was calculated from the number of pixels surrounded and the signal intensity of each pixel.There was only slight changes in the erector spinae CCSA proximal to a posterior lumbar arthrodesis. Erector spinae CCSA decreased by 27% distal to the arthrodesis. Curare showed no efficacy in preventing muscle damage.Erector spinae muscle alterations mainly occur distal to posterior lumbar surgical procedures.,0

PATIENTS, DESIGN, INTERVENTION: Ninety-nine adult recipients of allogeneic SCT were randomized by age and gender into two groups. In one group, the patients received 1000 mg calcium carbonate and 800 IU vitamin D daily, and females received estrogen and males received testosterone replacement therapy. In another group, the patients received the same treatments plus six iv infusions of 60 mg pamidronate before and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 months after SCT.Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and the upper femur, measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and bone turnover markers were followed for 12 months.In the pamidronate group, lumbar spine BMD remained stable but decreased in the other group by 2.9% at 12 months (P = 0.0084 between the groups over time). Total hip BMD reduced 5.1% in the pamidronate group and 7.8% in the other group by 12 months (P = 0.0015), and femoral neck BMD reduced 4.2 and 6.2%, respectively (P = 0.074). In the pamidronate group, serum type I procollagen amino-terminal propeptide (P = 0.032 between the groups over time) and urinary type I collagen amino-terminal telopeptide (P = 0.035) decreased 79 and 68% during the first 3 months, and remained lowered thereafter, but did not change in the other group.The recipients of allogeneic SCT receiving additional pamidronate sustain less bone loss than those treated with calcium, vitamin D, and sex steroid replacement alone. Despite all the efforts, however, bone loss is not totally abolished at the hip.",0

The study enrolled 106 patients undergoing knee surgery who received 5 ml of 1% mepivacaine immediately under the inguinal ligament 1 to 2 cm medial to the anterior superior iliac spine (subinguinal technique) or around the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve located (nerve-targeting technique). The time required to perform the block and the onset time of the block were similar for both techniques. However, a significantly higher percentage of patients obtained loss of pinprick sensation on the lateral thigh within 10 minutes with the subinguinal technique than with the nerve-targeting technique. The findings suggest that ultrasound-guided lateral femoral cutaneous nerve blocks can be easily performed and that injecting local anaesthetic immediately under the inguinal ligament rather than around the nerve itself blocks the nerve more reliably.",0

The aim of this study is to assess whether the modified Sims position on the side of the fetal spine increases the rotation to occiput anterior position in women with epidural analgesia and a fetus in persistent occiput posterior (POP) position.This is an open, randomized controlled, clinical trial. One hundred and twenty women in labor with fetuses in POP position were included. The diagnosis was performed through digital vaginal examination and confirmed with an ultrasound scan. Women were randomized into the free position group or the modified Sims on the side of the fetal spine. The primary outcome was rotation to occiput anterior, and secondary outcomes were type of delivery, postpartum perineal condition, perinatal results, and maternal satisfaction.In pregnant women undergoing labor in the Sims position, fetuses in POP rotated to occiput anterior in 50.8% of cases, whilst in the free position group, the rotation occurred in 21.7% (P = .001). The rate of vaginal deliveries was higher in the Sims group compared with the free position group (84.7% vs 68.3%, P = .035).The modified Sims position is a maternal posture intervention efficient in POP rotation, which decreases cesarean delivery rate.

Our hypothesis was that high-dose perioperative steroids would decrease edema and thus decrease the incidence of delayed extubation.We studied patients undergoing 2- or 3-level anterior cervical corpectomy procedures with anterior strut graft reconstruction. Sixty-six patients were randomized to receive 3 doses of either intravenous dexamethasone (n = 35) or saline (n = 31). The first dose was given before the incision, with subsequent doses given 8 and 16 hours later. Patients remained intubated until postoperative day 1, at which time a cuff leak test was performed by the anesthesiology attending. If a leak was present, the patient was extubated. If not, the test was repeated each postoperative day until a leak was present, indicating a patent airway.Five of 35 (14%) in the steroid group and 6 of 31 (19%) in the saline group required delayed extubation (P = 0.22). There were no statistical differences in preoperative parameters of age, gender, diagnosis, smoking history, BMI, number of operative levels, or preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists rating between the 2 groups. Similarly there were no differences between the groups for duration of anesthesia, intraoperative colloids or crystalloids, intraoperative blood loss, or intraoperative urine output. The data for both groups were pooled to evaluate risk factors for delayed extubation.

Previous studies only found postoperative analgesia dosage significantly reduced in tDCS group while the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was applied. However, there lacks the study about the effect of M1-tDCS on pain intensity and brain activity while the analgesia dosage is the same for both groups.To investigate whether M1-tDCS can (1) reduce pain intensity and (2) change spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations in prefrontal cortex, in patients with postoperative pain, after taking the constant dosage of analgesics.A prospective, single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study was conducted. 32 patients with postoperative pain after lumbar spine surgery were recruited. All patients received same dosage of dezocine before intervention. In the morning of the first day after surgery and before dezocine injection, a single 20-minute session of anodal M1-tDCS was applied to 'tDCS' group while sham stimulation to 'sham' group. Numeric rating scale (NRS) and resting-state EEG with eyes-closed were measured and analyzed. EEG spectral powers were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Preoperative background variables, active range of neck motion, handgrip strength, radiological evaluation and subjective variables were used in a multiple regression model to find the strongest predictors of postoperative outcome as measured by current pain intensity and the Neck Disability Index (NDI). Male sex, greater kyphosis at the level operated on, non-smoking, a greater neck mobility in right rotation, low disability on NDI, and older age were predictors of pain reduction and explained 30% of current pain intensity at follow-up. Higher educational level, non-smoking, greater kyphosis at the level operated on, a greater flexion mobility, greater right handgrip strength and lower current pain intensity were predictors of improvement, and explained 28% of the postoperative outcome on NDI. The most important predictor for postoperative pain intensity was the magnitude of the preoperative kyphosis. Preoperative pain intensity was the most important predictor for improved NDI. At follow-up about 70% of the patients still had deficit based on current pain intensity and NDI, and 44% had remaining dysfunction based on Odom's criteria. In conclusion, the multivariate analysis shows that male sex, non-smoking, greater segmental kyphosis and a low pain and disability level are preoperative predictors of a good outcome in ACDF. In addition, the study suggests the importance of other predictive variables than those studied for the outcome of ACDF.",0

Lumbo-pelvic posture, range of motion (ROM) in the shoulder and spine, and strength in shoulder and pectoral major and minor, and serratus anterior were taken at baseline, week 8 and after a 4-week follow-up. Outcome assessors were blinded to allocation.At week eight the intervention group had an improvement in lumbo-pelvic posture, as indicated by a reduction in pelvic obliquity compared to the control group (mean difference = -8.39°, 95 % CI: -15.64 to -1.13°, p = 0.023).

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of high-dose ambroxol (990 mg/day) in the improvement of oxygenation and prevention of postoperative respiratory complications in the patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI).MethodsA total of 61 acute CSCI patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of our hospital between January 2009 and June 2011 were included in the study. They were graded as ASIA A and ASIA B according to the classification of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) and were randomly divided into two groups: one group received intravenous ambroxol at 990 mg/day for 5 consecutive days after operation; the other group treated without ambroxol served as control. The results of arterial blood gas analysis on postoperative day 3 and 5 and occurrence of pulmonary complications within 5 days after operation were evaluated.ResultsThe group treated with high-dose ambroxol showed a lower rate of postoperative pneumonia and hypoxemia within 5 days after operation. On the 3rd and 5th days, the oxygenation index in the high-dose ambroxol group (291.02 ± 34.96 and 301.28 ± 37.69) was significantly higher than in the control group (230.08 ± 26.25 and 253.82 ± 26.26), with significant differences between the two groups (P = 0.045 and 0.041).ConclusionAdministration of high-dose ambroxol should be considered as an alternative and effective approach to reduce the postoperative respiratory complications and improve the oxygenation status in acute CSCI patients.",0

Forty-eight patients presenting with the clinical syndrome of SCM, with a modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score of 12 points or more, were randomised into two groups. Group A, treated conservatively, consisted of 27 patients, mean age 55.6 +/- 8.6 years, while group B was treated surgically (21 patients, mean age 52.7 +/- 8.1 years). The clinical outcome was measured by the mJOA score, recovery rate (RR), timed 10 m walk, score of daily activities (recorded by video and evaluated by two observers blinded to the therapy), and by the subjective assessment of the patients at 6, 12, and 24 months of the follow-up. There was, on average, no significant deterioration in mJOA score, recovery ratio, or timed 10 m walk within either group during the 2 years of follow-up. In the surgery group there was a slight decline in the scores for daily activities and subjective evaluation. A comparison of the two groups showed no significant differences in changes over time in mJOA score or quantified gait, but there were significant differences in the score of daily activities recorded by video at 24 months, which was a little lower in the surgical group, and also in RR and subjective evaluation, which were both worse in the surgical group at months 12 and 24. However, at month 6, this last parameter was significantly better in the surgical than in conservative group. Surgical treatment of mild and moderate forms of SCM in the present study design, comprising the patients with no or very slow, insidious progression and a relatively long duration of symptoms, did not show better results than conservative treatment over the 2-year follow-up.",0

Perioperative anticoagulation therapy was not permitted; mechanical deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was allowed. Doppler imaging for deep vein thrombosis was done on postoperative day 4 (or day of discharge), or for suspected deep vein thrombosis. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed by Doppler result or adverse event report. The criterion for no additional risk of deep vein thrombosis was a 1-sided 97.5% upper confidence limit < or =4% between groups.Of the 680 subjects analyzed (340 in each treatment group), 16 (4.7%) in the epoetin alfa group and 7 (2.1%) in the standard of care group had a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis either by Doppler or by adverse event report with normal Doppler. The between-group difference was 2.6% (97.5% upper confidence limit, 5.4%). Deep vein thrombosis confirmed by Doppler (4.1% vs. 2.1%), other clinically relevant thrombovascular events (1.5% vs. 0.9%), and all adverse events combined (76.5% vs. 73.2%) occurred with similar frequency in the 2 treatment groups.This study documented a higher incidence of deep vein thrombosis and similar rates of other clinically relevant thrombovascular events with epoetin alfa versus standard of care for blood conservation in subjects who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation before spinal surgery.

Injections were made with 0.3 mL kg(-1) of lidocaine mixed with new methylene blue. Time to perform each block and current used during NS technique were recorded. Dogs were anesthetized during the blocks and euthanized once completed. Dissections were performed to evaluate staining of nerves, spinal cord, mediastinum, pleura and vessels. An anova and Tukey adjustment for time, logistic regression for association between current and nerve staining and a generalized linear mixed model for staining of different structures were used. Significance was considered when p ≤ 0.05.The median (range) number of nerves stained was 2 (0-4) with BL, 1 (0-3) with NS and 1 (0-4) with US guided technique. No significant differences in staining of C6, C8 and T1 or other structures were found among techniques. Nerve C7 was more likely to be stained by BL (p = 0.05). Time to perform the blocks was significantly different among techniques, with mean ± SD duration in minutes of 3.6 ± 1.8 with BL, 6.3 ± 2.7 with US and 12.2 ± 5 with NS. The most common complication was staining of the spinal cord (29%, 38% and 39% with BL, NS and US, respectively).Success rates were low and complication rates were relatively high, based on staining, with the three techniques.The use of more advanced techniques for PBPB in dogs is not justified according to this study. Clinical significance of the complications encountered in this study should be evaluated.",0

The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of longitudinal ultrasound imaging for thoracic epidural block (T5-T6 or T6-T7) in anesthetized children scheduled for the Nuss procedure. METHODS: Neuraxial structure in the longitudinal paramedian section was observed using ultrasound imaging before epidural puncture (US group, n = 10). In the control group, usual epidural block without ultrasound was performed. Attempts were made to observe epidural catheterization in ultrasound imaging in three cases. RESULTS: Patient age ranged from 5 to 7 years. Time for epidural block in the US group [100 (77-116) s; median value (95% confidence interval)] was significantly shorter than that in the control group [165 (130-206) s; P = 0.001]. The difficulty score was significantly lower in the US group than in the control group (P < 0.001). Epidural catheterization was observed in all three cases in which the catheter manipulated the dura mater ventrally. There was a high correlation (r = 0.98, P < 0.001) between needle depth and ultrasound estimation of the skin-dura distance in the US group. CONCLUSION: We concluded that longitudinal paramedian ultrasound imaging could reduce performance time and the difficulty for anesthesiologists during epidural block.",0

Methods: In 100 patients (four groups, 25 patients in each) undergoing thoracotomy, a thoracic epidural catheter was inserted pre-operatively. In G-TIVA-TEA and G-ISO-TEA, bupivacaine 0.1% + 0.1 mg/ml morphine was administered intra-operatively (10 ml of first bolus + 7 ml/h infusion). Propofol infusion or isoflurane concentration was adjusted to keep a bispectral index (BIS) of between 40 and 50 in all groups. FiO2 was 0.8 during OLV and 0.5 before and after OLV. Partial arterial and central venous oxygen pressures (PaO2 and PvO2), arterial and venous oxygen saturations and Qs/Qt values were recorded before, during and after OLV. Results: During OLV, PaO2 was significantly higher and Qs/QT significantly lower in G-TIVA-TEA and G-TIVA compared with G-ISO-TEA and G-ISO (PaO2: 188 ± 36; 201 ± 39; 159 ± 33; 173 ± 42 mmHg, respectively; Qs/Qt: 31.2 ± 7.4; 28.2 ± 7; 36.7 ± 7.1; 33.7 ± 7.7%, respectively). No statistical changes were observed in patients with TEA compared with without TEA in any measurement. Conclusion: During OLV, TEA does not significantly affect the oxygenation and Qs/Qt and can be used safely regardless of whether TIVA or inhalation techniques are used.",0

We tested the hypotheses that (i) sympathetic block by thoracic epidural anaesthesia (TEA) unmasks the influence on arterial pressure of genetic variations and (ii) vasopressor requirements during TEA depend on ADRB2 gene variation.Ninety-three elective patients undergoing abdominal surgery were included prospectively. After epidural bupivacaine 0.5% (15 mg test dose+50 mg), arterial pressure, heart rate, and progression of sensory block were measured for 20 min in the supine awake state and for 20 min after standardized anaesthetic induction of general anaesthesia. The primary endpoint was cumulative dose of the α-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine administered to sustain a mean arterial pressure >70 mm Hg. The ADRB2 polymorphisms Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu were genotyped using Slowdown-PCR.After TEA, 86 (93%) patients required phenylephrine. The mean dosages (sd) were significantly different between the ADRB2 genotypes [Arg16Arg 357 µg (326), Arg16Gly 776 µg (449), Gly16Gly 600 µg (443), P=0.036; Gln27Gln 356 µg (254), Gln27Glu 639 µg (354), Glu27Glu 577 µg (388), P=0.007]. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age, male gender, rostral extent of sensory block, lower arterial pressure before TEA, and ADRB2 Glu27 allele together explained 37% of phenylephrine dosage variation, with genetic variants being the second most important predictor (10%; P<0.001).The ADRB2 Glu27 allele is an independent predictor of arterial hypotension and vasopressor requirements after TEA.

At week 48, patients treated with zoledronate were randomized again to receive a second dose (two-dose group; n = 12) or to continue with diet counselling only (single-dose group; n = 9). Changes in lumbar spine and hip BMD and bone turnover markers were compared.The median percentage change from baseline to week 96 in L1-L4 BMD was -1.74% [interquartile range (IQR) -2.56, 3.60%], 7.90% (IQR 4.20, 16.57%) and 5.22% (IQR 2.02, 7.28%) in the control, two-dose and single-dose groups, respectively (P < 0.01, control vs. two doses; P = 0.02, control vs. single dose; P = 0.18, two doses vs. single dose). Hip BMD changed by a median of 2.12% (IQR -0.12, 3.08%), 5.16% (IQR 3.06, 6.74%) and 4.47% (IQR 1, 5.58%), respectively (P = 0.04, control vs. two doses; P = 0.34, two doses vs. single dose). No differences between the two-dose and single-dose groups were detected in bone markers at week 96.The benefits for BMD of a single dose of zoledronate in 2 years may be comparable to those obtained with two doses of the drug after 96 weeks, although this study is insufficiently powered to exclude a real difference. Future studies should explore whether biennial administration of zoledronate is a useful alternative in the treatment of osteoporosis in HIV-infected patients.",0

In each position, the subjects adopted (i) a self-selected posture, (ii) a sagging posture, and (iii) an erect posture. Cervical retraction, backset, and vertical distance from the top of the head restraint to the occipital protuberance in the back of the head of the test subject were measured. These data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and linear regression analysis with a significance level set to p < 0.05.In the self-selected posture, the average backset was 61 mm for drivers, 29 mm for front passengers, and 103 mm for rear passengers (p < 0.001). Women had lower mean backset (40 mm) than men (81 mm), particularly in the self-selected driving position. Backset was larger and cervical retraction capacity lower in the sagging posture than in the self-selected posture for occupants in all three occupant positions. Rear passengers had the largest backset values. Backset values decreased with increased age. The average cervical retraction capacity in self-selected posture was 35 mm for drivers, 30 mm for front passengers, and 33 mm for rear passengers (p < 0.001).Future design of rear-end impact protection may take these study results into account when trying to reduce backset before impact.

Recent development of a low profile, flexible, strain-gauged device (""Lordosimeter"") facilitated this study.The Lordosimeter was taped to the skin along the midline of the lumbosacral region. Orthoses studied were Boston anterior opening, Aspen lumbosacral, and Cybertech. Specified activities of daily living were performed for each orthosis condition. Subject effort during the flexion/extension task was assessed by surface electromyography (EMG). Comfort was assessed by visual analog scale.There were no significant differences in EMG between orthoses. For lumbar flexion, trunk flexion, total lumbar motion, and total trunk motion, the mean values for Aspen and Boston (but not Cybertech) were significantly smaller than for no orthosis for most of the tasks and there were no significant differences between Aspen and Boston. The total lumbar motion allowed by each orthosis (averaged across tasks and relative to the no orthosis condition) was 81% for Aspen, 79% for Boston, and 97% for Cybertech. The comfort rating averaged across tasks was 2.24 for Aspen, 4.12 for Boston, and 3.92 for Cybertech (0 = very comfortable, 10 = very uncomfortable). Aspen was significantly more comfortable than Boston or Cybertech. Boston and Cybertech did not differ significantly.The Lordosimeter is useful for measuring lumbar motion during orthosis wear. The Aspen and the Boston orthoses provided significant flexion-extension motion restriction compared with no orthosis, but for almost all of the motion measures did not differ from each other. The Cybertech did not differ significantly from the no orthosis condition. The Aspen orthosis was rated significantly more comfortable than the Boston or the Cybertech.",0

The wake-up test is used for early detection of these injuries. In this study we compared the effects of propofol and midazolam during wake-up test in scoliosis surgery.Thirty patients were randomly assigned as group P and group M. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2.5 mg kg(-1) for group P or midazolam 0.5 mg kg(-1) for group M with remifentanil 0.5 μg kg(-1) and cisatracurium 0.15 mg kg(-1) for both groups. At the maintenance of anesthesia O2/air and infusions of remifentanil and cisatracurium were used. In group P, propofol 6-10 mg kg(-1)h(-1) and in group M, midazolam 0.5 mg mg kg(-1) were preferred. Approximately 15 min before the wake-up test, all drugs were discontinued. At the wake-up test, anesthesiologist asked the patients to open their eyes and squeeze his/her hand at every 30s until the patients responded. Then patients were told to wiggle their toes.

Furthermore, re-collapse is quite difficult to predict because of the variety of risk factors, and no widely accepted accurate prediction systems exist. Although load-sharing classification has been known to help to decide the need for additional anterior column support, this radiographic scoring system has several critical limitations. Purpose (1) To evaluate risk factors and predictors for postoperative re-collapse in T-L burst fractures. (2) Through the decision-making model, we aimed to predict re-collapse and prevent unnecessary additional anterior spinal surgery. Study Design Retrospective comparative study. Patient Sample Two-hundred and eight (104 men and 104 women) consecutive patients with T-L burst fracture who underwent posterior instrumented fusion were reviewed retrospectively. Burst fractures caused by high-energy trauma (fall from a height and motor vehicle accident) with a minimum 1-year follow-up were included. The average age at the time of surgery was 45.9 years (range, 15–79). With respect to the involved spinal level, 95 cases (45.6%) involved L1, 51 involved T12, 54 involved L2, and 8 involved T11. Mean fixation segments were 3.5 (range, 2–5). Pedicle screw instrumentation including fractured vertebra had been performed in 129 patients (62.3%). Outcome Measures Clinical data using self-report measures (visual analog scale score), radiographic measurements (plain radiograph, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance image), and functional measures using the Oswestry Disability Index were evaluated. Methods Body height loss of fractured vertebra, body wedge angle, and Cobb angle were measured in serial plain radiographs. We assigned patients to the re-collapse group if their body height loss progressed greater than 20% at any follow-up time compared with immediate postoperative body height loss; we assigned the remaining patients to the well-maintained group. The chi-square test and t test of SPSS were used for comparison of differences between two groups and multiple logistic regression analysis for risk factor evaluation. Through the decision tree analysis of statistical package R, a decision-making model was composed, and a cutoff value of revealed risk factors and re-collapse rate of each subgroup were identified. The present study wassupported by the University College of Medicine Research Fund (university to which authors belong). There was no external funding source for this study. The authors have no conflict of interest to declare. Results Re-collapse occurred in 31 of 208 patients (14.9%). In this group, age, the proportion of male gender, preoperative height loss, and preoperative wedge angle were significantly greater than the well-maintained group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified two independent risk factors: age (adjusted odds ratio 1.084, p=.002) and body height loss (adjusted odds ratio 1.065, p=.003). According to the decision-making tree, age (>43 years) was the most discriminating variable, andpreoperative body height loss (>54%) was the second. In this model, the re-collapse rate was zero in ages less than 43 years, and among those remaining, nearly 80% patients with greater than 54% of body height loss belonged to the re-collapse group. Conclusions The independent predictors of re-collapse after posterior instrumented fusion for T-L burst fracture were the age at operation (>43 years old) and preoperative body height loss (>54%). Careful assessment using our decision-making model could help to predict re-collapse and prevent unnecessary additional spinal surgery for anterior column support, especially in young patients.",0

Prophylactic treatment of bone is therefore recommended in the early posttransplant period. As a large number of transplant recipients develop adynamic renal osteodystrophy, recombinant parathyroid hormone (rPTH) could be a promising therapeutic option. In a 6-month double-blind, randomized trial, 26 kidney transplant recipients were treated with daily subcutaneous injections of 20 μg teriparatide (PTH 1–34) or placebo. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck, lumbar spine and radial bone was measured at transplantation and after 6 months. Paired bone biopsies for histomorphometric analysis were obtained in six, and for measurement of bone matrix mineralization in five patients of each group. Serologic bone markers were measured at baseline and every 3 months. A total of 24 out of 26 patients completed the study. Femoral neck BMD was stable in the teriparatide group, but decreased significantly in the placebo group. Lumbar spine and radial BMD, histomorphometric bone volume and bone matrix mineralization status remained unchanged in both groups. Serologic bone markers were similarly reduced in both groups throughout the study. We conclude that teriparatide does not improve BMD early after kidney transplantation. Neither histological analysis nor bone markers provide evidence of improved bone turnover or mineralization.",0

A 6-week intervention was followed up directly afterwards and after 12 months.The purpose was to evaluate the preventive efficacy of a neck/shoulder exercise regimen for neck pain in air force helicopter pilots.Neck pain is a significant medical problem in modern military aviation. Research shows neck-muscle dysfunction in subjects with various neck disorders. So far, evidence for neck exercise as prevention or early intervention is sparse, and few trials use randomized controlled design.Sixty-eight helicopter pilots on active flying duty with or without neck pain were randomly assigned to a supervised neck/shoulder exercise regimen or a control group receiving no such regimen. The key outcome was change in the prevalence of neck pain cases at the 12-month follow-up, rated for the previous week and the previous 3 months. Secondary outcomes included neck-flexor surface electromyographic activity during active craniocervical flexion and pain-related fear regarding physical activity. In addition, a secondary regression analysis included preintervention predictors that may be associated with change in prevalence of neck-pain cases at the 12-month follow-up.Eighty-two percent (56/68) of the participants assigned at random completed the intervention and provided data at month 12. Regression analysis showed a reduction in the prevalence of neck pain cases in the exercise group, which was significant for pain ratings during the previous week, OR = 3.2 (95% CI = 1.3-7.8), and previous 3 months, OR = 1.9 (95% CI = 1.2-3.2). Electromyographic activity at the highest contraction level was significantly reduced in the exercise group, P < 0.05, whereas no between-groups effect emerged for pain-related fear. Results from the secondary analysis showed that general strength training for more than 1 hour per week before the intervention predicted reduction in prevalence of pain at follow-up.A supervised neck/shoulder exercise regimen was effective in reducing neck pain cases in air force helicopter pilots. This was supported by improvement in neck-flexor function postintervention in regimen members. However, no effect emerged for pain-related fear. General strength training before the intervention predicted reduction in prevalence of pain at follow-up.",0

There is no published literature that describes how this task is altered by sacroiliac joint dysfunction (SIJD).The objective of this study was to compare lower extremity biomechanics and the onset of muscle activity when rising from a chair in subjects with SIJD and in healthy persons.Six women with unilateral SIJD and six age-matched healthy controls performed a sit-to-stand task while we measured kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity.Subjects stood up at a preferred speed from a seated position on an armless and backless adjustable stool. We measured kinematics with a 10-camera motion capture system, ground reaction forces for each leg with force plates, and muscle activity with surface electromyography. Joint angles and torques were calculated using inverse dynamics. Leg-loading rate was quantified as the average slope of vertical ground reaction (VGRF) force during the 500-millisecond interval preceding maximal knee extension.Between-leg differences in loading rates and peak VGRFs were significantly greater for the SIJD group than for the control group. Maximal hip angles were significantly less for the SIJD group (p=.001). Peak hip moment in the SIJD group was significantly greater in the unaffected leg (0.75±0.22 N⋅m/kg) than in the affected leg (0.47±0.29 N⋅m/kg, p=.005). There were no between-leg or between-group differences for peak knee or ankle moments. The onset of activity in the latissimus dorsi muscle on the affected side was delayed and the erector spinae muscles were activated earlier in the SIJD group than in the control group.Subjects with SIJD have a greater VGRF on the unaffected leg, generate a greater peak hip moment in the unaffected leg, use a smaller range of motion at the hip joint of the affected leg, and delay the onset of a key muscle on the affected side when rising from a seated position.",0

In trauma victims with possible cervical spine injury, any movement of the head and neck should be avoided. <h3>Study Objectives</h3> We investigated the effect of GlideScope videolaryngoscopy on cervical spine movement compared with conventional laryngoscopy in anesthetized patients with unsecured cervical spines. <h3>Methods</h3> Sixty patients scheduled for elective surgery with general anesthesia and without anticipated airway problems were enrolled in the study after ethics committee approval and written informed consent. Intubation was performed with videolaryngoscopy (GlideScope<sup>®</sup>, Verathon Inc., Bothell, WA) or conventional laryngoscopy (MacIntosh). Using video motion analysis with a lateral view, the maximum extension angle α was measured with reference to anatomical points (baseline and line drawn from processus mastoideus to os frontale [glabella]). Values were analyzed using Mann Whitney <i>U</i>-tests. <h3>Results</h3> The deviation of α was a median 11.8° in the videolaryngoscope group and 14.3° in the conventional group (<i>p</i> = 0.045), with a maximum of 19.2° (videolaryngoscopy) vs. 29.3° (conventional). Intubation by physicians with some experience in videolaryngoscopy was associated with a reduced angle deviation (α = 10.3°) compared to inexperienced physicians (12.8°, <i>p</i> = 0.019). Intubation time was a median 24 s (min/max 12/75 s) in the MacIntosh group and 53 s (min/max 28/210 s) in the GlideScope group. In 3 patients randomized to the conventional group in whom conventional intubation failed, intubation could be successfully performed using videolaryngoscopy. <h3>Conclusion</h3> GlideScope videolaryngoscopy reduces movements of the cervical spine in patients with unsecured cervical spines and therefore might reduce the risk of secondary damage during emergency intubation of patients with cervical spine trauma.",0

Tracheal intubation by means of the intubating laryngeal mask (Fastrach), a modified conventional laryngeal mask airway, seems to require less neck manipulation. The aim of this study was to compare the excursion of the upper cervical spine during tracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopy with that during intubation via the laryngeal mask (Fastrach), by examination of lateral cervical spine radiographs in healthy young patients. The intubating laryngeal mask (Fastrach) caused less extension (at C1-2 and C2-3) than intubation by direct laryngoscopy. Direct laryngoscopy is still the fastest method to secure an airway provided no intubating difficulties are present. However, in trauma patients requiring rapid sequence induction and in whom cervical spine movement is limited or undesirable, the intubating laryngeal mask (Fastrach) is a safe and fast method by which to secure the airway.",0

Liver and lung transplantation cases had before transplantation a lower bone density at the spine and femur compared to heart transplant cases. Heart transplant cases lost considerably more bone immediately after transplantation than liver and lung transplant recipients. A positive effect of 2 years alfacalcidol treatment (0.5-1 microgram/day) on bone loss was observed in all treated groups. Alfacalcidol was particularly effective against trabecular bone loss at the spine in rheumatoid arthritis patients and transplant recipients. There is a manifest difference in evolution between organ transplant groups and bone sites measured. Liver and lung transplant recipients respond better to therapy than cardiac recipients.",0

The T-scores were ≤-1.5. Patients were randomly assigned to four groups: HILT+EX (group I), placebo laser plus exercise (PL+EX; group II), HILT alone (HILT; group III), and PL (group IV). HILT was applied to the lower back and hip regions. Aerobic, weight-bearing, flexibility, strengthening, and balance exercises were performed three times per week for 24 weeks. The measured outcomes were BMD of the L2-L4 spine and total hip. Measurements were taken before and after 24 weeks and at 1 year of follow-up.Lumbar and total hip BMD significantly increased post-treatment in the HILT+EX and PL+EX groups, but insignificantly in the HILT and PL groups. HILT+EX showed a significantly greater effect than PL+EX did on lumbar BMD, with no significant difference in total hip BMD, after 24 weeks and at follow-up.Although HILT alone did not effectively increase lumbar and total hip BMD, HILT combined with exercise was more effective than exercise alone at increasing lumbar BMD after 24 weeks of treatment, with effects lasting up to 1 year.",0

An Investigation of Cervical Zygapophysial Joint Pain,"Mechanical pain sensitivity is assessed in every patient with pain, either by palpation or by quantitative pressure algometry. Despite widespread use, no studies have formally addressed the usefulness of this practice for the identification of the source of pain. We tested the hypothesis that assessing mechanical pain sensitivity distinguishes damaged from healthy cervical zygapophysial (facet) joints.Thirty-three patients with chronic unilateral neck pain were studied. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were assessed bilaterally at all cervical zygapophysial joints. The diagnosis of zygapophysial joint pain was made by selective nerve blocks. Primary analysis was the comparison of the PPT between symptomatic and contralateral asymptomatic joints. The secondary end points were as follows: differences in PPT between affected and asymptomatic joints of the same side of patients with zygapophysial joint pain; differences in PPT at the painful side between patients with and without zygapophysial joint pain; and sensitivity and specificity of PPT for 2 different cutoffs (difference in PPT between affected and contralateral side by 1 and 30 kPa, meaning that the test was considered positive if the difference in PPT between painful and contralateral side was negative by at least 1 and 30 kPa, respectively). The PPT of patients was also compared with the PPT of 12 pain-free subjects.Zygapophysial joint pain was present in 14 patients. In these cases, the difference in mean PPT between affected and contralateral side (primary analysis) was -6.2 kPa (95% confidence interval: -19.5 to 7.2, P = 0.34). In addition, the secondary analyses yielded no statistically significant differences. For the cutoff of 1 kPa, sensitivity and specificity of PPT were 67% and 16%, respectively, resulting in a positive likelihood ratio of 0.79 and a diagnostic confidence of 38%. When the cutoff of 30 kPa was considered, the sensitivity decreased to only 13%, whereas the specificity increased to 95%, resulting in a positive likelihood ratio of 2.53 and a diagnostic confidence of 67%. The PPT was significantly lower in patients than in pain-free subjects (P < 0.001).Assessing mechanical pain sensitivity is not diagnostic for cervical zygapophysial joint pain. The finding should stimulate further research into a diagnostic tool that is widely used in the clinical examination of patients with pain.",0

A 10-year prospective randomised study was performed. The objective of the study was to compare conservative and operative treatments of mild and moderate, non-progressive, or slowly progressive, forms of CSM. Sixty-four patients were randomised into two groups of 32. Group A was treated conservatively while group B was treated surgically. The clinical outcome was evaluated by modified JOA score, timed 10-m walk, score of daily activities recorded by video and evaluated by two observers blinded to the type of therapy, and by subjective assessment by the patients themselves. Seventeen patents died of natural, unrelated causes, during the follow-up. A total of 25 patients in the conservatively and 22 in the surgically treated group were used for the final evaluation. There was no statistically significant difference between both groups in mJOA score, in subjective evaluation by the patients themselves and in evaluation of video-recordings of daily living activities by two observers blinded to treatment mode. There was neither any difference found in the percentage of patients losing the ability to walk nor in the time taken to cover the 10-m track from a standing start. Comparison of conservative and surgical treatment in mild and moderate forms of CSM in a 10-year follow-up has not shown, on average, a significant difference in results. In both groups, patients get better and worse. According to the power analysis it is necessary admit that these results possess the low ability to answer definitely the question which treatment is better for the patients with a mild and moderate non-progressive CSM because of the low number of patients for the final evaluation and for clinically negligible differences between two compared arms. These findings can serve as a worthy odds-on hypothesis which needs the confirmation.",0

The chemotherapy regimen was 2SHRZ/XHRZ. According to the duration of the chemotherapy, the patients were divided into two groups, the ultra-short-course chemotherapy group with an average duration of 4.5 months, and the standard chemotherapy group with an average duration of 9 months. The same surgery was performed for patients in the two groups.The duration of the follow-up ranged from 61 to 87 months, with an average of 69.1 months. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, kyphosis and nerve function, recovery of work, and activities of daily living were not significantly different between the two groups before or after treatment; however, the aforementioned indices were significantly different before and after treatment within groups. There was no significant difference in postoperative bone graft healing between the two groups. The drug side effects were significantly different between the two groups.With thorough focus debridement, bone grafting, and internal fixation, the efficacy of ultra-short chemotherapy was similar to that of standard chemotherapy for the treatment of spinal tuberculosis. The ultra-short-course chemotherapy can shorten the course of treatment and reduce drug side effects.",0

Ambulation and survival were compared with age, pre-, and postoperative neurological (American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] Impairment Scale [AIS]) and performance status (Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS]), and Tokuhashi Score using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed rank tests, Pearson correlation coefficient, Cox regression model, log-rank analysis, and Kaplan-Meier analysis.Forty patients were included (21 male, 54%; mean age 74 years, range 65-87). Surgery was performed a mean 3.8 days after onset of motor symptoms. Mean duration of ambulation and survival were 474 (range 0-1662) and 525 days (range 11-1662), respectively; 53% of patients (21 of 40) survived and 43% (17 of 40) retained ambulation for ≥1 year. There was no significant relationship between survival and ambulation for patients aged 65-69, 70-79, or 80-89 years, although Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested stratification. There was a significant relationship between duration of ambulation and pre- and postoperative AIS (p=.0342, p=.0358, respectively) and postoperative KPS (p=.0221). Tokuhashi score was not significantly related to duration of survival or ambulation, and greatly underestimated life expectancy in 22 of 37 (59%) patients with scores 0-11.Decompressive surgery led to marked improvement in neurological function and performance status.

The real-time ultrasound control of the procedure for puncture was therefore evaluated.Methods: Thirty parturients scheduled for Caesarean section were randomized to three equal groups. Ten control patients received conventional combined spinal–epidural anaesthesia. Ten of the remaining patients received ultrasonic scans by an offline scan technique, and 10 received online imaging of the lumbar region during epidural puncture. The epidural space was identified and needle advancement was surveyed through the interspinal and flaval ligaments. The number of attempts to advance the needle to achieve a successful puncture was measured and compared, as well as the number of vertebral interspaces punctured before successful entry into the epidural space.Results: There was no difference between patient characteristics in the three groups. The visualization of the epidural structures and of the needle manipulations was very effective. In the ultrasound group, the reduction in the number of attempts at puncture was significant (P &lt; 0.036). The number of interspaces necessary for puncture was reduced (P &lt; 0.036) in the ultrasound online group compared with controls. The number of spinal needle manipulations was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.036).Conclusions: Real-time ultrasonic scanning of the lumbar spine is an easy procedure. It provides an accurate reading of the location of the needle tip and facilitates the performance of combined spinal–epidural anaesthesia.",0

Low bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with PHPT is an indication for surgical intervention because successful parathyroidectomy results in a dramatic increase in BMD. However, low BMD values are almost an invariable finding in elderly women with PHPT, who are often either unwilling or considered unfit for surgery. Bisphosphonates are capable of suppressing parathyroid hormone (PTH)-mediated bone resorption and are useful for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. In this pilot-controlled study, we investigated the effects of oral treatment with alendronate on BMD and biochemical markers of calcium and bone metabolism in elderly women presenting osteoporosis and mild PHPT. Twenty-six elderly patients aged 67–81 years were randomized for treatment with either oral 10 mg alendronate on alternate-day treatment or no treatment for 2 years. In the control untreated patients a slight significant decrease was observed for total body and femoral neck BMD, without significant changes in biochemical markers of calcium and bone metabolism during the 2 years of observation. Urine deoxypyridinoline (Dpyr) excretion significantly fell within the first month of treatment with alendronate, while serum markers of bone formation alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin fell more gradually and the decrease became significant only after 3 months of treatment; thereafter all bone turnover markers remained consistently suppressed during alendronate treatment. After 2 years in this group we observed statistically significant increases in BMD at lumbar spine, total hip, and total body (+8.6 ± 3.0%, +4.8 ± 3.9%, and +1.2 ± 1.4% changes vs. baseline mean ± SD) versus both baseline and control patients. Serum calcium, serum phosphate, and urinary calcium excretion significantly decreased during the first 3-6 months but rose back to the baseline values afterward. Increase in serum PTH level was statistically significant during the first year of treatment. These preliminary results may make alendronate a candidate as a supportive therapy in patients with mild PHPT who are unwilling or are unsuitable for surgery, and for whom osteoporosis is a reason of concern.",0

Posterior shear loads act on those segments of the spine that are posteriorly inclined, as determined by each individual's inherited sagittal spinal profile. Accordingly, it can be inferred that certain sagittal spinal profiles are more prone to develop a rotational deformity that may lead to idiopathic scoliosis; and lumbar scoliosis, on one end of the spectrum, develops from a different sagittal spinal profile than thoracic scoliosis on the other end.To examine the role of sagittal spinopelvic alignment in the etiopathogenesis of different types of idiopathic scoliosis.Multicenter retrospective analysis of lateral radiographs of patients with small thoracic and lumbar adolescent idiopathic scoliotic curves.We included 192 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients with either a thoracic (n=128) or lumbar (n=64) structural curve with a Cobb angle of less than 20° were studied. Children with other spinal pathology or with more severe idiopathic scoliosis were excluded, because this disturbs their original sagittal profile. Subjects who underwent scoliosis screening and had a normal spine were included in the control cohort (n=95).Thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, T9 sagittal offset, C7 and T4 sagittal plumb lines, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, and sacral slope, as well as parameters describing orientation in space of each individual vertebra between C7 and L5 and length of the posteriorly inclined segment.On standardized lateral radiographs of the spine, a systematic, semi-automatic measurement of the different sagittal spinopelvic parameters was performed for each subject using in-house developed computer software.Early thoracic scoliosis showed a significantly different sagittal plane from lumbar scoliosis. Furthermore, both scoliotic curve patterns were different from controls, but in a different sense. Thoracic kyphosis was significantly decreased in thoracic scoliosis compared with both lumbar scoliosis patients and controls. For thoracic scoliosis, a significantly longer posteriorly inclined segment, and steeper posterior inclination of C7-T8 was observed compared with both lumbar scoliosis and controls. In lumbar scoliosis, the posteriorly inclined segment was shorter and located lower in the spine, and T12-L4 was more posteriorly inclined than in the thoracic group. The lumbar scoliosis cohort had a posteriorly inclined segment of the same length as controls, but T12-L2 showed steeper posterior inclination. Lumbar lordosis, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, and sacral slope, however, were similar for the two scoliotic subgroups as well as the controls.This study demonstrates that even at an early stage in the condition, the sagittal profile of thoracic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis differs significantly from lumbar scoliosis, and both types of scoliosis differ from controls, but in different aspects. This supports the theory that differences in underlying sagittal profile play a role in the development of different types of idiopathic scoliosis.",0

The best system for predicting survival in patients with lung cancer spinal metastases remains undetermined. The high incidence of spinal metastases from lung cancer and improved survival of patients treated with systemic therapy warrants evaluation of these scoring systems in this particular context.Patients with lung cancer spinal metastases treated at our institution between May 2001 and August 2012 were studied. Fifty-one patients were treated surgically. The primary outcome measure was survival from the time of diagnosis. Scoring-predicted survival was compared with actual survival. Potential prognostic factors were investigated using Cox regression analyses. Predictive values of each scoring system for 3- and 6-month survival were measured via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.Histological subtype (P = 0.015), sex (P = 0.001), Karnofsky performance scale (P = 0.001), extent of neurological palsy (P = 0.002), and visceral metastases (P = 0.037) are significant predictors of survival. Besides the Oswestry spinal risk index, no significant differences were found between different prognostic subgroups within the individual scoring systems. Although the modified Bauer score was most accurate, all four scoring systems had areas under the ROC curve 0.5 or less.Although better prognostic scores correlated with longer survival, all four scoring systems are inaccurate in prognosticating patients with lung cancer spinal metastases. Specific lung cancer histology appears prognostic and should be considered, especially given the increased survival of patients receiving new targeted therapies appropriate to their disease.3.",0

After autologous microskin grafting, the 4 wounds in each pig were divided into 4 groups according to the random number table, with 6 wounds in each group. Wounds in allogenic skin group (AS) were covered by full-thickness skin from one (not the recipient) of the 6 pigs; wounds in xenogenic skin group (XS) were covered by full-thickness skin of sheep; wounds in xenogenic ADM group (XA) were covered by ADM of sheep; wounds in combination group (C) were covered by ADM of sheep combined with auto-crosslinked sodium hyaluronate gel. The wounds were bound up with pressure, and the dressing was changed once every 7 days. On post surgery day (PSD) 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 when changing dressing, the condition of wounds and the exfoliation of the covering on microskin were observed, and the complete exfoliation time of the covering was recorded. On PSD 28, 35, and 42, the wound healing rate was calculated. Data were processed with one-way analysis of variance and SNK test.(1) On PSD 7, no fluid appeared under the covering of wounds in groups AS and C, while plenty of fluid appeared under the covering of wounds in groups XS and XA. From PSD 14 to 35, most of the full-thickness skin of pig in group AS did not exfoliate. All the full-thickness skin of sheep in group XS exfoliated, leaving a lot of crusts on the surface of the wounds on PSD 14. Most of the ADM of sheep in group XA separated from the wound with the crusts turning dry and exfoliating on PSD 14. All the ADM of sheep exfoliated with most of the wounds healed in group C on PSD 35. On PSD 42, all the full-thickness skin of pig in group AS exfoliated, leaving most of the wounds unhealed; all the crusts exfoliated and the majority of wounds were healed in group XS and XA group; all the wounds in group C were healed. (2) Compared with that in group C[(32.7±3.3) d], the complete exfoliation time of the covering was obviously shorter in group XS[(15.2±4.8) d]and group XA[(22.2±6.3) d], with P values below 0.05, while the complete exfoliation time of the covering in group AS[(44.8±2.7) d]was obviously longer (P<0.05). (3) On PSD 28, 35, and 42, the wound healing rates in groups XS and XA[(21.2±2.6)%, (51.4±2.4)%, (89.6±2.8)%, and (23.7±3.4)%, (53.6±6.3)%, (91.3±4.9)%, respectively]were obviously lower than those in group C[(35.1±3.4)%, (62.1±6.7)%, (98.8±1.0)%, respectively, with P values below 0.05]. On PSD 42, the wound healing rate in group AS[(44.0±3.8)%]was significantly lower than the rates in the other 3 groups (with P values below 0.05).Auto-crosslinked sodium hyaluronate gel combined with ADM of sheep used as covering of microskin grafts on full-thickness wound in pig can lengthen the persistence time of ADM of sheep on the wound, as well as promote wound healing.",0

Prospective randomized comparison of anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) plus transpedicular instrumentation plus posterolateral fusion (PLF) (360° fusion) to ALIF plus transpedicular instrumentation without PLF (270° fusion). Objectives. To compare the clinical outcomes, costs, and utilization of health resources of 360°versus 270° fusions. Background. The 360° fusion is effective, but its costs and utilization of health resources are high. The PLF often resorbs and may not be necessary. Methods. Before and after surgery pain was measured by the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), and function was measured by the Oswestry Low Back Disability Index (OSI). Costs were calculated by billing records. Operating times, blood loss, and hospital stays were measured at the time of hospital discharge. Results. There were 48 patients: 21 women and 27 men. Mean age was 42 years. Follow-up averaged 35 months (range 24–45 months). In both 360° and 270° fusions, there were significant improvements in NRS and OSI, and the percentage of solid ALIF was high. Only 14% of PLF appeared solid bilaterally and 18% appeared solid on one side only. There were no significant differences in changes in NRS, changes in OSI, or percentage solid ALIF between the 360° and 270° fusions. However, the 270° fusion group had significantly less blood loss, shorter operative times, shorter hospital stays, and lower professional fees, and although hospital charges were lower, this difference was not significant. Conclusion. Both the 360° and 270° fusions significantly reduce pain and improve function, and there are no significant clinical differences between them. However, there were shorter operating times, less blood loss, lower costs, and less utilization of health care resources associated with the 270° fusions.",0

This is not well assessed on conventional end-points. Since 2001, we have studied the prevalence of ""forgotten knee"" (FK) after TKR in a prospective pragmatic cohort, with comparison to conventional scores.Patients undergoing TKR were enrolled between January 2001 and January 2008. Preoperative medical history and anthropometric and clinical data were recorded, and composite scores (Knee Society Score (KSS), Lequesne) were assessed. At each follow-up visit, FK acquisition was assessed by the closed question ""Do you feel the operated knee to be always normal in all everyday activities?"".Five hundred and eighty-four TKRs in 485 patients were included. Among the TKR, 91.6% were performed for severe osteoarthritis of the knee. FK frequency at a mean 75.8 months' follow-up was 42.9% while 86.1% of TKRs had excellent (KS Knee Score (KSKS)>80) or 34.9% perfect (KSKS=100) outcome. Only 66.1% of the 204 TKRs with perfect outcome on KSKS were reported as FK. Most patients achieved FK within 18 months.In this prospective study, 42.9% of TKRs were considered always forgotten in all everyday activities.",0

Very rapid bone loss, osteopenia, and osteoporosis have been documented in the first 6 to 12 mo after renal transplantation. Investigated was the effect of treatment with active vitamin D on the prevention of posttransplantation bone loss. Forty adult men who were recent renal transplant recipients were enrolled onto the study. Patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 received daily alfacalcidol 0.5 μg by mouth, and group 2 (control) received placebo. Every patient in both groups received daily 500-mg calcium carbonate supplements. Parameters of bone metabolism and bone mineral density measured at three sites were assessed before and after the study period. Bone mineral density was increased by 2.1%, 1.8%, and 3.2% at lumbar spine, femoral neck, and forearm, respectively, in group 1, whereas it decreased by 3.2%, 3.8%, and 1.8% at the same sites in the control group ( P &lt; 0.05). Serum intact parathyroid hormone level decreased significantly in group 1 compared with the control group ( P = 0.003). Early bone loss that occurs during the first 1 yr after renal transplantation could be prevented by alfacalcidol. Use of alfacalcidol early after transplantation is safe and well tolerated.

Two hundred and ninety parturients at full term, who were scheduled for cesarean section under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia were randomly divided into two groups: group control (I) and group NS (II). The epidural puncture was performed at the estimated L3-4 interspace with a Tuohy needle attached to a 5 ml syringe. Loss of resistance to air was used to identify the epidural space. In group I no fluid was injected into the epidural space before insertion of the catheter; while in group II NS 5 ml was injected into the epidural space before catheter insertion. The incidence of blood vessel trauma and paraesthesia were evaluated. The effect of spinal anesthesia was evaluated. Blood vessel trauma in group II was significantly lower than in group I, P < 0.05. However, the incidence of paraesthesia was similar between the two groups, P > 0.05. Preloading the epidural space with NS can decrease the incidence of clinically apparent injury to blood vessels during epidural catheter placement, and can improve the effects of spinal analgesia, but does not reduce the incidence of paraesthesia.",0

Further studies are required to identify the factors determining the pattern of bone remodelling following THA and obtain improvements in the design and durability of prostheses. In this study, we monitored periprosthetic bone loss around two different types of hydroxyapatite coated femoral implant over a 3-year period to evaluate their design and investigate the relationship with the preoperative bone mineral density (BMD) at the spine, hip and forearm. Sixty patients (35 F, 25 M, mean age 63 years, range 46-75 years) undergoing THA were randomised to either the Anatomic Benoist Girard (ABG) or Mallory-Head (MH) femoral stem. Preoperative dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were acquired of the posteroanterior (PA) and lateral lumbar spine, the contralateral hip and the non-dominant forearm. Postoperative DXA scans were performed to measure periprosthetic BMD at 10 days (treated as baseline), 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after THA using a standard Gruen zone analysis. Results were expressed as the percentage change from baseline and the data examined for the differences in bone loss between the different Gruen zones, between the ABG and MH stems, and the relationship with preoperative BMD. A total of 50 patients (24 ABG, 26 MH) completed the study. Three months after THA there was a statistically significant BMD decrease in every Gruen zone that varied between 5.6% and 13.8% for the ABG prosthesis and between 3.8% and 8.7% for the MH prosthesis. Subsequently, in most zones BMD reached a plateau or showed a small recovery. However, BMD continued to fall in Gruen zones 1 and 7 in ABG patients and Gruen zone 1 in MH patients. Bone loss was less in every Gruen zone in MH patients compared with ABG with the largest difference (10%, P=0.018) in Gruen zone 7. Highly significant relationships were found between periprosthetic bone loss and preoperative BMD measured at the PA spine ( P<0.001), total hip ( P=0.004) and total distal radius ( P<0.001). This study showed differences between two different designs of hydroxyapatite-coated implant that confirmed that prosthesis design influences periprosthetic bone loss. The study also showed that patients' bone density measured at the spine, hip or forearm at the time of operation was a major factor influencing bone loss around the femoral stem.",0

Forty-nine postmenopausal women with chronic, inflammatory diseases and BMD T-scores < or = -2.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck who were concurrently treated with estrogen > or = 1 year and prednisone 5-20 mg/day for > or = 1 year participated. Subjects were randomized to treatment with human PTH (1-34) 400 IU/day or to a control group for 1 year and followed for an additional year. Serum and urine were collected at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months for measurement of bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), osteocalcin (OC) and deoxypyridinoline (DPD). We constructed an Uncoupling Index (UI) from all three markers (UI = [ZBAP + Zoc]/2 -ZDPD, where the Z-score for each marker in each subject was calculated from the mean and standard deviation of the study population at baseline). BMD of the lumbar spine and hip was measured at baseline and every 6 months thereafter by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and annually by quantitative computed tomography (QCT; spine only). BMD of the spine, but not hip (total, femoral neck or trochanter), and levels of all three markers increased significantly as a result of PTH treatment (p<0.01 compared with controls). The resorption response lagged behind that of formation as evidenced by a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the UI for the first 9 months of treatment. The UI values and changes from baseline to 1, 3 and 6 months in BAP, OC and DPD were correlated with the 12- and 24-month changes in spine BMD measured both with QCT and with DXA (Spearman's rank coefficients <0.76; p<0.05). Most PTH-treated subjects could be identified as biochemical responders by least significant change analysis. Following 1 month of therapy, BAP and OC identified 65% and 81% as responders, respectively. The responder rates were 79%, 79% and 75% for BAP, OC and DPD, respectively by 6 months. Responders exhibited a high level of diagnostic accuracy for predicting a gain in BMD (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves exceeding 0.79 for QCT and 0.70 for DXA), but not the magnitude of the gain. These data suggest that serial bone marker measurements may be useful in identifying skeletal responders to an anabolic therapy, such as PTH, in estrogen-replete postmenopausal women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.",0

To avoid it, an endotracheal tube is retained in patients maintained under sedation overnight. This study was conducted to determine whether dexmedetomidine would be superior in sedative effects to propofol for postoperative sedation after ECSS. METHODS: We studied 32 consecutive patients undergoing ECSS who required prophylactic intubation postoperatively under sedation overnight. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group D (n = 16) received dexmedetomidine 0.1 ?g/kg/min for 10 min as a loading dose, followed by a continuous infusion at 0.4 ?g/kg/h. Group P (n = 16) received propofol 0.1 mg/kg/min for 10 min as a loading dose, followed by a continuous infusion at 1 mg/kg/h. All patients received analgesia with buprenorphine. Ramsay sedation scale, extremity movement, and pain intensity were recorded every 2 h. Dexmedetomidine and propofol dosages were adjusted to maintain a desired sedation level. Nursing staff adjusted dopamine to maintain systolic blood pressure >100 mmHg and administered atropine when the heart rate was <50 bpm. RESULTS: The proportions of adequate sedation level, movement, and pain status were similar between groups. In group D, heart rates were lower, frequency of atropine use was greater, and dopamine dose was higher than in group P. CONCLUSION: Both sedatives are efficacious after ECSS; however, dexmedetomidine decreased heart rate and required higher dose of dopamine.",0

A newly designed lightwand device (Trachlight) or an intubating laryngeal mask (Fastrach) may avoid hyperextension of the neck. However, there are few objective data that guide us in selecting the appropriate devices. We conducted a prospective randomized study in 148 patients who received general anesthesia for whom the operations were related to the clinical and/or radiographic evidence of cervical abnormality. Trachlight or Fastrach was used for tracheal intubation with the head and neck held in a neutral position. In the Trachlight group, intubation was successful at the first attempt in 67 of 74 (90.5%) cases and at the second attempt in 5 (6.8%) cases. In contrast, in the Fastrach group, 54 of 74 (73.0%) patients were intubated within our protocol. The mean time for successful tracheal intubation at the first attempt was significantly shorter in the Trachlight group than in the Fastrach group. The Trachlight may be more advantageous for orotracheal intubation in patients with cervical spine disorders than the Fastrach with respect to reliability, rapidity, and safety.The Trachlight may be more advantageous for orotracheal intubation in patients with cervical spine disorders than the Fastrach with respect to reliability, rapidity and safety.",0

This study investigated the effects of shoes and insole materials on a) the rate of shock transmission to the spine, b) the temporal response of spinal musculature to impact loading, and c) the time interval between peak lumbar acceleration and peak lumbar muscle response. It was hypothesised that shoes and inserts a) decrease the rate of shock transmission, b) decrease the low back muscle response time, and c) shorten the time interval between peak lumbar acceleration and peak lumbar muscle response. Twelve healthy subjects were tested while jogging barefoot (unshod) or wearing identical athletic shoes (shod). Either no material, semi-rigid (34 Shore A), or soft (9.5 Shore A) insole material covered the force plate in the barefoot conditions and was placed as insole when running shod. Ground reaction forces, acceleration at the third lumbar level, and erector spinae myoelectric activity were recorded simultaneously. The rate of shock transmission to the spine was greater (p < 0.0003) unshod (acceleration rate: Means +/- SD 127.35 +/- 87.23 g/s) than shod (49.84 +/- 33.98 g/s). The temporal response of spinal musculature following heel strike was significantly shorter (p < 0.023) unshod (0.038 +/- 0.021 s) than shod (0.047 +/- 0.036 s). The latency between acceleration peak (maximal external force) and muscle response peak (maximal internal force) was significantly (p < 0.021) longer unshod (0.0137 +/- 0.022s) than shod (0.004 +/- 0.040 s). These results suggest that one of the benefits of running shoes and insoles is improved temporal synchronization between potentially destabilizing external forces and stabilizing internal forces around the lumbar spine.",0

However, data on changes in BMD after discontinuing tenofovir are lacking.We performed a two-centre randomized pilot study in virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients receiving tenofovir with osteopenia/osteoporosis (OsteoTDF study, ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT 01153217). Fifty-four patients were randomly assigned to switch from tenofovir to abacavir (n = 26) or to continue with tenofovir (n = 28). Changes in lumbar and total hip BMD were evaluated at Week 48 from baseline.Five patients discontinued the study (three from the tenofovir group and two from the abacavir group). No significant differences were detected between the groups at Week 48 (P = 0.229 for total hip and P = 0.312 for lumbar spine). However, hip BMD improved by 2.1% (95% CI -0.6 to 4.7) (P = 0.043) in the abacavir group and 0.7% (95% CI -0.9 to 2.4) (P = 0.372) in the tenofovir group. Lumbar spine BMD varied by -0.7% (95% CI -3.8 to 3.3) (P ≤ 0.001) in the abacavir group and -1.2% (95% CI -3.8 to 0.4) (P < 0.001) in the tenofovir group.Switching from tenofovir to abacavir led to a slight improvement in femoral BMD although no differences were detected between groups. Larger studies are necessary before firm recommendations can be made on the discontinuation of tenofovir in patients with a low BMD.",0

Dogs were divided into the artificial AAOJR group (n=10), the decompression group (n=10), and the healthy control group (n=10) using a random number table.To evaluate whether the use of AAOJR for repair of atlantoaxial instability retains rotation and restores stability.Atlantoaxial instability is characterized by excessive movement or laxity at the junction between the atlas (C1) and axis (C2). Pure decompression can lead to considerable loss of head and neck rotation and postoperative impairment. A series of biomechanical tests on cadavers found that the artificial AAOJR might rebuild the stability and retain the rotation function.We designed the AAOJ based on the radiologic and anatomic data of the dog atlas and axis, and established an animal model by resecting the odontoid and implanting the AAOJ into dogs. The biomechanical experiments measured the range of motion (ROM), neutral zone (NZ), and stiffness of flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation in the intact state, the decompressed state, after AAOJR, and after a fatigue test.Compared with the intact state, after decompression operation, ROM and NZ in all directions, and stiffness during flexion were increased, and stiffness in all other directions was decreased. Compared with the after decompression state, AAOJR before and after the fatigue test resulted in decreased ROM in all directions (all P<0.05), decreased NZ during flexion/extension and lateral bending (all P<0.05), an increased NZ during axial rotation (both P<0.05), and increased stiffness in all directions (all P<0.05).These results indicate that AAOJR could reconstruct the vertebral stability of the C1-C2 segment and retain some axial rotation function.",0

However, it is not known whether the changes in BMD and bone turnover are associated with changes at the tissue level, nor how changes with raloxifene compare with estrogen. In this randomized, double blind study, we evaluated the effects of raloxifene (Evista, 60 mg/day) or conjugated equine estrogens (CEE; Premarin, 0.625 mg/day) on bone architecture, bone turnover, and BMD. Iliac crest bone biopsies were obtained at baseline and at the end of the study after double tetracycline labeling and were analyzed for standard histomorphometric indexes. Serum and urinary biochemical markers of bone turnover were measured at baseline and at 4, 10, 18, and 24 weeks of treatment. Total body, lumbar spine, and hip BMD were measured at baseline and at the end of the study by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Activation frequency and bone formation rate/bone volume were significantly decreased from baseline in the CEE, but not in the raloxifene, group. Bone mineralization did not change in either group. Most markers of bone resorption and formation decreased in both groups, but to a greater degree in the CEE group (P < .05). Total body and lumbar spine BMD increased from baseline in both groups, with a greater increase in the CEE group (P < 0.05). Hip BMD significantly increased from baseline in the raloxifene group, but the change was not different from that in the CEE group. These results suggest that raloxifene reduces bone turnover and increases bone density, although to a lesser extent than CEE. Thus, raloxifene is an alternative to CEE for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.",0

Congenital stenosis, on the other hand, presents earlier in age with similar clinical findings but with multilevel involvement and fewer degenerative changes. These patients may have subtle anatomic variations of the lumbar spine that may increase the likelihood of thecal sac compression. However, to the authors' knowledge, no quantitative studies have addressed various radiographic parameters of symptomatic, congenitally stenotic individuals to normal subjects. <h3>Purpose</h3> To radiographically quantify and compare the anatomy of the lumbar spine in symptomatic, congenitally stenotic individuals to age- and sex-matched, asymptomatic, nonstenotic controlled individuals. <h3>Study design/setting</h3> A prospective, control-matched, cohort radiographic analysis. <h3>Patient sample</h3> Axial and sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lateral, lumbar, plain radiographs of 20 surgically treated patients who were given a clinical diagnosis of congenital lumbar stenosis by the senior author were randomized with images of 20, asymptomatic age- and sex-matched subjects. <h3>Outcome measures</h3> MRIs and lateral, lumbar, plain radiographs were independently quantitatively assessed by two individuals. Measurements obtained from the axial MRIs included: midline anterior-posterior (AP) vertebral body diameter, vertebral body width, midline AP canal diameter, canal width, spinal canal cross-sectional area, pedicle length, and pedicle width. From the sagittal MRIs, the following measurements were calculated: AP vertebral body diameter, vertebral body height, and AP canal diameter at the mid-vertebral level. On the lateral, lumbar, plain radiograph (L3 level), the AP diameters of the vertebral body spinal canal were measured. <h3>Methods</h3> The images of these 40 individuals were then randomized and distributed in a blinded fashion to five separate spine surgeons who graded the presence and severity of congenital stenosis utilizing a five-tier scale. Images consisting of 15 symptomatic individuals, graded definitely congenitally stenotic (mean age, 51.7 years; range, 43–65 years), and 15 asymptomatic individuals, graded definitely not stenotic (mean age, 50.7 years; range, 41–55 years), were age- and sex-matched and included for further review. From these 30 patients, a lateral, lumbar, plain radiograph and axial and sagittal MRIs (T1/T2 weighted) from L2-L5 were quantitatively analyzed. Rater reliability was assessed by Kappa coefficient testing. <h3>Results</h3> The cross-sectional area of the canal was significantly smaller in the congenitally stenotic patients at all lumbar levels measured (L2: 176 mm<sup>2</sup> vs. 259 mm<sup>2</sup>, L3: 177 mm<sup>2</sup> vs. 275 mm<sup>2</sup>, L4: 183 mm<sup>2</sup> vs. 283 mm<sup>2</sup>, L5: 213 mm<sup>2</sup> vs. 323 mm<sup>2</sup>, p<.05). Pedicle length was markedly shorter in the stenosis group at each lumbar level (L2: 5.9 mm vs. 8.9 mm, L3: 6.0 mm vs. 8.8 mm, L4: 6.5 mm vs. 9.2 mm, L5: 5.8 mm vs. 9.1 mm, p<.05). Furthermore, midline, axial AP canal diameter, vertebral body width, and sagittal AP canal diameter were all significantly smaller than the control patients (p<.05). A ratio of the AP diameter of the pedicle length to the vertebral body was also noted to be statistically significant on both the lateral plain radiographs (L3: 0.426 vs. 0.704) and sagittal MRI (L2: 0.343 vs. 0.461, L3: 0.361 vs. 0.461, L4: 0.362 vs. 0.481, L5: 0.354 vs. 0.452, p<.05). No difference was noted comparing the AP diameter of the vertebral body (axial and sagittal images), vertebral body height, canal width, and pedicle width. Kappa testing coefficient indicated a strong rater reliability (k=0.81, 95% confidence interval: 0.62–0.94). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Congenital lumbar stenosis has not been clearly defined radiographically. Clinically, congenitally stenotic patients present at a younger age with fewer degenerative changes and multiple levels of involvement. Radiographically, these patients have a shorter pedicular length and as a result a smaller cross-sectional spinal canal area (mean critical values of 6.5 mm and 213 mm<sup>2</sup> were observed, respectively). The mean critical ratios were 0.43 (2:1 AP vertebral body: pedicle length) on the lateral lumbar radiograph and 0.36 on the sagittal MRI. The altered canal anatomy resulting from a decreased pedicle length may anatomically predispose these patients to earlier complaints of symptomatic neurogenic claudication. Identification of the presence of congenital stenosis should increase the treating surgeon's awareness of the potential need for multilevel treatment.",0

It is not known whether early changes in markers can predict the long-term changes in bone density with therapy. We assessed bone density and biochemical markers of bone turnover [urine N-telopeptide cross-linked collagen type 1 (NTx), serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin] every 6 months for 3 yr in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. After a 3-month run-in phase, 373 community-dwelling, elderly women were randomized to 1) alendronate, 2) hormone replacement therapy, 3) combination therapy with alendronate and hormone replacement therapy, or 4) placebo. Women on active treatment with the greatest decrease in markers of bone turnover at 6 months had the greatest increases in spine and hip bone density at 3 yr. The response to alendronate was generally associated with greater reductions in markers than the response to hormone replacement and was associated with greater increases in bone density at the spine and hip. Those in the tertile with the greatest decrease in urinary NTx had a 10.1% increase in spine bone density and a 6.1% increase in hip bone density compared with those in the lowest tertile, who had a 5.9% increase in spine bone density and a 2.1% increase in hip bone density. In women on active treatment, the area under the receiver operator curve for a 6-month change in markers to predict a response in bone mineral density at 3 yr was highest for urine NTx (range, 75-78%) and lowest for osteocalcin (range, 60-66%). We conclude that short-term changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover at 6 months predict bone density changes at the spine and hip at 3 yr in elderly women on alendronate, hormone replacement therapy, or combination therapy.",0

All patients were evaluated by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and underwent the dual energy x-ray absorptiometry test for bone mineral density (BMD), and serum osteocalcin (BGP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P) were measured at three months before and after the treatment. Significant differences in serum Ca, P, BGP, and ALP were found in each group between before and after treatment (P < 0.05), while no differences between the calcitonin and control groups were found. No difference was observed in femur BMD between the two groups, or between before and after treatment in each group. There was a significant difference in spine BMD between before and after treatment in the control group (P < 0.05) but not in the calcitonin group, while no difference was found between the calcitonin and control groups. Futhermore, VAS score significantly declined in each group after treatment (P < 0.05), but much more in the calcitonin group than the control group (P < 0.05). Our finding suggests that calcitonin may alleviate bone pain during the anastrozole treatment of breast cancer but has no effect on bone loss during cancer treatment.",0

Both groups also received an exercise program consisting of heat, lumbar traction, and flexion exercises.The primary outcome was disability measured using the modified Oswestry Disability Index. Secondary outcomes were disability, measured using the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, pain severity, and patient perceived benefit. Measures were collected midway through intervention at 3 weeks and after intervention at 6 weeks.There was no difference between the groups in reduction in disability or pain over the 6-week intervention period. The between-group difference in the modified Oswestry Disability Index was 3.2 points (95% CI -3.1 to 7.7) at 6 weeks, and in pain severity was 2 mm on a 100 visual analogue scale (95% CI -5 to 10). Furthermore, the wide confidence intervals associated with estimates of patient benefit are consistent with no difference between the two groups. However, both groups did improve.Treadmill with body weight support and cycling may be equally effective in the conservative management of people with lumbar spinal stenosis. However, the improvement observed in both groups was probably a combination of the intervention and the natural course of recovery of lumbar spinal stenosis.",0

This is a post-hoc analysis from the Sygen multicenter randomized controlled trial.Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) data were collected when patients were first assessed in the emergency room (Time A) and at the time of randomization (Time B). Individuals were subdivided by ASIA grade and by the level of the systolic BP (SBP).Only individuals with cervical SCI from the Sygen trial (n = 577) were evaluated. Severe complete SCI (ASIA grade = A) was established in 57% of these patients. A total of 74 (13%) patients with neurogenic shock (SBP < 90 mmHg) at Time A were identified. The SBP increased significantly from Time A to Time B (P < 0.0001). The median time from SCI to surgical intervention, for ASIA A, was 80.9 hours for patients with initial SBP < 90 mmHg and 58 hours for patients with initial SBP > or = 90 mmHg (P = 0.025). Multivariable analysis after adjusting for confounders revealed a statistically significant difference in the time to surgical intervention based on SBP for ASIA A (P = 0.026), yet not for ASIA B or C/D.The presence of neurogenic shock was associated with a delay in the timing of surgical intervention in patients with cervical SCI. Detailed evaluation of autonomic dysfunctions following SCI including cardiovascular instability could improve our understanding of the complexities of clinical presentations and possible neurological outcomes.",0

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a pre-transplant infusion of pamidronate on fracture incidence and bone loss during the first year after transplantation.Ninety-nine adults awaiting orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) were randomised to pamidronate or no treatment. Spinal X-rays were obtained at baseline and after 12 months. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at the lumbar spine (L1-4) and femoral neck at baseline, and 3, 6, and 12 months after OLT.The incidence of fractures in the first year after OLT was 8%, four patients within the pamidronate treated group and two in the untreated group developing fractures (P=0.40). No significant spinal bone loss occurred in either group during the first year. However, significant and sustained bone loss occurred at the femoral neck in both groups. No significant differences were seen between pamidronate treated or untreated groups at either site.Pamidronate in the regimen used had no significant effect on fracture rate or BMD post-transplant. The low incidence of fracture and absence of spinal bone loss indicate that bone disease after liver transplantation may be less common than previously reported.",0

How the long-term beneficial effects of raloxifene on bone turnover, as assessed by bone histomorphometry, compare with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and placebo are not known. We studied 66 healthy postmenopausal women (age 55 to 75 years, mean 63 years) who were randomized to either raloxifene 150 mg/day, HRT (Premarin 0.625 mg/day, and Provera 2.5 mg/day), or placebo for 1 year. All women received 1-1.5 g of calcium/day. Following double tetracycline labeling, transiliac bone biopsies were obtained at baseline and 1 year and analyzed for changes in histologic indexes of bone remodeling on the cancellous surface as well as at the endocortical subdivision of the endosteal envelope, the location of the greatest fraction of postmenopausal bone loss. BMD and biochemical markers of bone turnover were also determined at baseline and 1 year. Four paired biopsies were obtained in the HRT group, six in the raloxifene group, and five in the placebo group. The frequency of remodeling events on cancellous bone and rate of bone formation in both cancellous and endocortical bone increased in the placebo group, while these measurements decreased in both drug treatment groups. Using analysis of mean percentage changes, when compared with the placebo group, these changes were significantly different for both raloxifene and HRT treatment groups (p<0.02). In all subjects, the bone was lamellar with discrete tetracycline labels and there was no evidence of marrow fibrosis or abnormal bone cells. BMD increased from baseline at the lumbar spine (p<0.05 in the HRT group) and in the total body (p<0.05 for both raloxifene and HRT). Compared with that of the raloxifene group, the increase in BMD was greater in the HRT group at the lumbar spine but not in the total body. Serum bone alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, and urine C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen significantly decreased (p<0.05) in both active treatment groups, changes significantly different from those seen with placebo. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that raloxifene preserves bone mass by reducing the elevated bone turnover found in postmenopausal women receiving placebo, by mechanisms similar to those operative in postmenopausal women receiving HRT.",0

In this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study of epidural anesthesia, we compared the onset, extent, and duration of sensory and motor blockade produced by plain 0.5% levobupivacaine (15 mL, 75 mg) with that of 0.5% levobupivacaine with the addition of 1:400,000 or 1:200,000 epinephrine in 117 patients undergoing elective spine surgery. The time to onset of adequate sensory block (T10 dermatome) was similar in all groups (12.4 +/- 6.6 min for plain levobupivacaine, 13.9 +/- 7.9 min for levobupivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine, and 12.7 +/- 4.9 min for levobupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine), with an average peak block height of T5. Time to complete regression of sensory blockade was also similar between groups (357 +/- 119 min for plain levobupivacaine, 378 +/- 98 min for levobupivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine, and 348 +/- 80 min for levobupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine). Peak serum levobupivacaine levels were reduced in each of the epinephrine-containing groups. We conclude that 0.5% levobupivacaine with or without 1:200,000 or 1:400,000 epinephrine produced effective epidural anesthesia in patients having lumbar spine surgery. Epinephrine 1:400,000 is as effective as 1:200,000 in reducing the resultant serum levobupivacaine levels after epidural anesthesia.",0

The use of endotracheal tubes (ETTs) with a modified cuff shape could be one preventive action. In this clinical, prospective, randomised controlled trial, we hypothesised that altering the cuff shape to a tapered shape could reduce the aspiration incidence. The primary outcome was aspiration of dye solution into the trachea.Patients scheduled for lumbar surgery were intubated with either an ETT with a barrel-shaped polyvinylchloride cuff (control group, n = 30) or tapered-shaped polyvinylchloride cuff (intervention group, n = 30). Subsequently, instillation with methylthioninium chloride was performed. At 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after intubation, bronchoscopy was performed assessing the degree of dye descent along the cuff and digitally stored. Single blind review of the videoclips provided data on incidence of dye aspiration and depth of penetration along the cuff.The traditional cuff showed descent of dye into the trachea in 20% of the patients. Although a tapered-shaped polyvinylchloride cuff leaked up to the second third of the cuff, no dye leakage into the trachea was observed. The use of a tapered-shaped cuff had a protective role against aspiration (T30: OR 3.0, CI 1.57-5.75; P = 0.001).Short-term use of tapered-shaped polyvinylchloride cuffs in surgical patients results in more effective sealing of the tracheal lumen in comparison with a traditional barrel-shaped polyvinylchloride cuffs. Further evaluation is needed to determine whether a reduction in post-operative pneumonia can be demonstrated when these cuffs are used.",0

Kefir is a product made by kefir grains that degrade milk proteins into various peptides with health-promoting effects, including antithrombotic, antimicrobial and calcium-absorption enhancing bioactivities. In a controlled, parallel, double-blind intervention study over 6 months, we investigated the effects of kefir-fermented milk (1,600 mg) supplemented with calcium bicarbonate (CaCO3, 1,500 mg) and bone metabolism in 40 osteoporosis patients, and compared them with CaCO3 alone without kefir supplements. Bone turnover markers were measured in fasting blood samples collected before therapy and at 1, 3, and 6 months. Bone mineral density (BMD) values at the spine, total hip, and hip femoral neck were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and at 6 months. Among patients treated with kefir-fermented milk, the relationships between baseline turnover and 6 months changes in DXA-determined BMD were significantly improved. The serum β C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTX) in those with T-scores > -1 patients significantly decreased after three months treatment. The formation marker serum osteocalcin (OC) turned from negative to positive after 6 months, representing the effect of kefir treatment. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) increased significantly after treatment with kefir, but decreased significantly in the control group. PTH may promote bone remodeling after treatment with kefir for 6 months. In this pilot study, we concluded that kefir-fermented milk therapy was associated with short-term changes in turnover and greater 6-month increases in hip BMD among osteoporotic patients.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02361372.",0

This prospective, randomized study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility of the hiatus injection under ultrasound guidance for caudal block in children.140 ASA I-II children undergoing inguinal hernia repair were randomly allocated to one of two groups (Group C or Group H, n = 70). 1 ml·kg(-1) of 0.25% ropivacaine was injected after the needle was inserted into the sacral canal in Group C, or after the needle pierced the sacrococcygeal ligament under a transverse ultrasound view in Group H. Success rate of block, puncture frequency, complications, and durations of block were recorded.The success rate of block was similar between two groups (95.7% in Group C vs 92.8% in Group H, P > 0.05). The first puncture success rate was higher, and the durations of block were shorter in Group H than in Group C (92.8% vs 60% and 145 ± 23s vs 164 ± 31s, respectively P < 0.05).

However, the effectiveness of SpineCor still remains controversial. The objective of the current study was to compare the treatment outcomes of SpineCor brace with that of rigid brace following the standardized Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) criteria on AIS brace study. METHODS: Females subjects with AIS and aged 10-14 were randomly allocated into two groups undergoing treatment of SpineCor (S Group, n = 20) or rigid brace (R Group, n = 18). During SpineCor treatment, patients who had curve progression of >5° would be required to switch to rigid brace treatment. The effectiveness of the two brace treatments was assessed using the SRS standardized criteria. RESULTS: Before skeletal maturity, 7 (35.0%) patients in the S Group and 1 (5.6%) patient in the R Group had curve progression >5° (P = 0.026). At skeletal maturity, 5 of the 7 (71.4%) patients who failed with SpineCor bracing showed control from further progression by changing to rigid bracing. At the latest follow-up with a mean duration of 45.1 months after skeletally maturity, 29.4% of patients who were successfully treated by rigid brace showed further curve progression beyond skeletal maturity, versus 38.5% of patients in the SpineCor group (P > 0.05). For both groups, the primary curves were slightly improved at the time of brace weaning, but additionally increased at the latest follow-up, with a rate of 1.5° per year for post-maturity progression. CONCLUSIONS: Curve progression rate was found to be significantly higher in the SpineCor group when compared with the rigid brace group. Changing to rigid bracing could control further curve progression for majority of patients who previously failed with SpineCor bracing. For both SpineCor and rigid brace treatments, 30-40% of patients who were originally successfully treated by bracing would exhibit further curve progression beyond skeletal maturity. The post-maturity progression rate was found to be 1.5° per year in the current study, which was relatively greater than those reported before.",0

We aimed to compare the extent of cervical spine movement during laryngoscopy using the KVL and Macintosh laryngoscopes.Following ethical approval, 29 patients with a normal cervical spine requiring general anesthesia and tracheal intubation were randomly subjected to both KVL and Macintosh laryngoscopy in a crossover. Cervical spine motion during each laryngoscopy was radiologically examined by measuring changes in cumulative spine motion and changes from the neutral position in the C0-C5 angles formed by the adjacent vertebrae. Time to tracheal intubation, laryngoscopic view, and ease of intubation were also recorded.Compared with direct laryngoscopy, the KVL resulted in significantly less movement of the C-spine at the C0-C1, and C3-C4, C4-C5 segments (mean differences: C0-C1: 3.01 ° [95% CI: -4.74° to -1.28°]; C3-C4: 1.81° [95% CI: -3.19° to -0.43°]; C4-C5: -0.88° [95% CI: -1.61° to -0.19°], P<0.02) and cumulative C-spine movement (mean 36.1˚[95% CI 32.72 to 39.51] vs. 44.1˚[95%CI: 39.54 to 48.75]; P=0.001).

The efficacy of single-injection PVB was compared with multiple-injection PVB on postoperative analgesia in VATS was studied. <h3>Design</h3> Prospective, randomized study. <h3>Setting</h3> Single university hospital. <h3>Participants</h3> Fifty patients undergoing VATS. <h3>Interventions</h3> A nerve stimulator-guided PVB was performed in the sitting position before surgery using a solution of 20 mL 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine by a single injection at T6 (group S, n=25) or by 5 injections of 4 mL each at T4 to T8 (group M, n=25). <h3>Measurements and Main Results</h3> A successful PVB was achieved in all patients. The times to perform the blocks were 6.8 ± 1.9 minutes in the S group and 17.9 ± 3.0 minutes in the M group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The times to block onset were 8.3 ± 1.8 minutes in the S group and 7.2 ± 0.9 minutes in the M group (<i>p</i> = 0.014). The numbers of anesthetized dermatomes were 5.8 ± 0.8 for the S group and 6.6 ± 1.1 for the M group (<i>p</i> = 0.009). The postoperative pain scores and morphine consumption with patient-controlled analgesia were comparable in the two groups. There were no significant differences in times to the first mobilization and hospital discharge for two groups. Patient satisfaction with the analgesic procedure was greater in the S group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). No complications were attributed to the blocks. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The two techniques provided comparable postoperative analgesia. However, single-injection PVB may represent an advantage over multiple-injection PVB in patients undergoing VATS, with greater patient satisfaction associated with a shorter procedure and the likelihood of decreased complications.",0

However, the association between weekly walking duration and LBP in the general population remains poorly understood.This study aimed (1) to analyze the association between walking and LBP and (2) to examine this association according to walking duration and overall walking days per week in a general population over 50years of age using a representative sample of Korean adults.Cross-sectional study.Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys V and VI, performed from 2010 to 2015.Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between walking days and duration and LBP. Analysis was restricted to participants aged over 50years who responded to surveys on LBP and walking activity.National health and nutrition examination surveys were performed in the Korean general population (N=48,482) from 2010 to 2015. LBP status was surveyed using a self-reported questionnaire form (""Have you complained of LBP for more than 30days during the past 3 months?""). Daily walking activity (low-intensity activity) was evaluated using the following two questions: (1) ""During the last 7days, on how many days did you walk for at least 10 minutes at a time? This includes at work and at home, walking to travel from place to place, and any other walking that you have done solely for recreation, sport, exercise, or leisure."" (2) ""How much time did you usually spend walking on each of those days?"" Walking duration per day was classified into two categories: over 30min/day and over 1h/day. Overall walking days per week were categorized into <3, 3-4, and ≥5days/week. Basic characteristics, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, and other variables were used to create multiple logistic regression models. No sources of funding and no conflicts of interest were associated with this study.Walking for more than 3days per week for over 30 minutes at a time was negatively associated with LBP in the unadjusted (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.65, p<.001) and fully adjusted logistic regression models (aOR: 0.79, p<.001). Similarly, walking for more than 5days per week for over 1 hour at a time was negatively associated with LBP in the unadjusted (aOR: 0.62, p<.001) and fully adjusted logistic regression models (aOR: 0.76, p<.001). The risk of LBP decreased with increasing walking days and duration.Our study showed that longer walking duration was associated with a lower risk of LBP using a cross-sectional health survey in the Korean general population. Regular walking with a longer duration for more than 3days/week is significantly associated with a lower risk of LBP in the general population aged over 50years.",0

Twenty-four weeks later, cross-over was performed to the other treatment regimen. Forty-four women completed the study. Their serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3, osteocalcin, carboxyterminal telopeptide aminoterminal (ICTP), of type I collagen propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist were measured at baseline and after 24 weeks of both treatments, as were also their body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure. Bone mineral density of the total body, spine and hip and total body fat, total lean body mass, trunk fat and trunk lean mass were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements at baseline and after 24 weeks of both regimens.During treatment, the addition of testosterone counteracted the decrease in IGF-I and PICP seen with estrogen therapy alone. Osteocalcin and ICTP were significantly reduced to the same extent by both therapies. No change ocurred in the IL-1 receptor antagonist. A significant increase was seen in total lean body mass with the estrogen/testosterone regimen, but the total fat mass, trunk lean or fat mass remained unchanged after 24 weeks of both treatments. No effect was detected on total, hip or spinal bone mineral density after treatment with estrogen alone or estrogen/testosterone. Likewise, BMI and blood pressure were unaffected.The addition of testosterone to oral estrogen might have positive effects on bone as suggested by the fact that it counteracted the decline in IGF-I and PICP levels. An anabolic effect on muscle was reflected by an increase in the total lean body mass. No adverse effects were noted on BMI, fat distribution or blood pressure during the 6-month treatment with oral testosterone undecanoate.",0

Current Advanced Trauma Life Support's recommendations are to log roll the patient 90 degrees, remove the spine board, inspect and palpate the back, and then log roll back to supine position. There are several publications showing unacceptable motion in an unstable spine when log rolling.Cervical spine motion was evaluated during spine board removal. A C5 to C6 instability was surgically created in cadavers. A three-dimensional electromagnetic tracking system was used to assess motion between C5 and C6. The log roll was compared with a lift-and-slide technique. Throughout the log roll procedure, manual inline cervical stabilization was provided by a trained individual in a series of trials. In other trials, the lift-and-slide technique was used. In the final stage, the amount of motion generated was assessed when the spine board removal techniques were completed by experienced and novice persons in maintaining inline stabilization of the head and neck.Motion between C5 and C6 was reduced during the lift-and-slide technique in five of six parameters. The reduction was statistically significant in four parameters. When performing the log roll, motion was not reduced with increased head holder experience.Spine boards can be removed using a lift-and-slide maneuver with less motion and potentially less risk to the patient's long-term neurologic function than expected using the log roll.",0

Identified barriers to changing physician behavior, in regard to management of back pain, have included patient factors such as their past back pain experiences and preferences for care as well as physician beliefs about the association of pain and activity; although the influence of physician special interests has not been studied.Back pain beliefs of different subsets (special interests vs. no special interests and CME vs. no CME) were compared using relative risks (RRs) adjusted for state and survey. The analysis was then repeated including all special interests and recent back pain CME in the model.Responses were received from 3831 general practitioners (overall response rate [RR]: 38.2%). Physicians with a special interest in LBP were more likely to believe that complete bed rest and avoidance of work is appropriate for acute low back pain (RR: 1.89 [95% CI: 1.53-2.33] and 1.55 [95% CI: 1.31-1.83], respectively) and lumbar spine radiographs are useful (RR: 1.36 [95% CI: 1.21-1.51]). The disparity between those with and without a special interest in LBP was still evident after adjusting for the presence of other special interests and recent CME. After adjusting for the presence of other special interests and recent CME, there were no important differences in back pain beliefs between those with and without a special interest in musculoskeletal medicine, while those with a special interest in occupational medicine and those who had received recent CME had better beliefs.A special interest in back pain is associated with back pain management beliefs contrary to the best available evidence. This has serious implications for management of back pain in the community.",0

We compared quality, patient acceptability and cost of TIVA using target control infusion (TCI) with propofol and VIMA with sevoflurane. Forty patients undergoing spinal surgery of 1-3 h were assigned to one of two groups. Group I received propofol-air-oxygen for induction followed by propofol-air-oxygen for maintenance. Group II received 8% sevoflurane-oxygen for induction and sevoflurane-oxygen-nitrous oxide for maintenance. Propofol had a significantly faster mean (SD) induction time (67 (20) s) than sevoflurane (97 (38) s) but was associated with double the incidence of involuntary movements. Although not significant, twice the number of interventions by the anaesthetist were required to maintain an adequate level of anaesthesia in the sevoflurane group. Emergence times, characteristics, postoperative nausea, vomiting and pain were unaffected by the anaesthetic technique. However, a more predictable emergence time was found following sevoflurane. Cardiovascular stability was good and comparable in both groups. The majority of patients found either technique acceptable and would choose the same anaesthetic again. Induction and maintenance was substantially cheaper with sevoflurane (28.06 Pounds) compared with propofol (41.43 Pounds).",0

In some studies with methods consistent with clinical practice guidelines, RFA results in improvements in pain and functional limitations. However, in other studies, RFA demonstrates limited benefit. Despite unanswered questions regarding efficacy of RFA, its use is widespread.To describe trends in the utilization and cost of lumbar RFA and lumbar facet injections.Retrospective cohort study.The sample was derived from the IBM/Watson MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Databases from 2007 to 2016.Longitudinal trends in the distribution and quantity of lumbar facet injections before lumbar RFA, corticosteroid administration during lumbar facet injections, progression to lumbar RFA after lumbar facet injections, lumbar RFA utilization, and costs of these interventions.Two primary cohorts were identified from patients who received lumbar RFA or lumbar facet injection procedures. Utilization rates per 100,000 enrollees were determined for both cohorts. The mean, median, and interquartile ranges of the number of facets targeted and costs per procedure were calculated by year and laterality, as well as overall. Costs in 2018 dollars were estimated by summing gross payment totals from patients and insurance plans. This study was supported by funds from the NIH, and has no conflict of interest associated biases.From 2007 to 2016, lumbar RFA sessions performed per 100,000 enrollees per year increased from 49 to 113, a 130.6% overall increase (9.7% annually). Lumbar facet injection use increased from 201 to 251 sessions per 100,000 enrollees, a 24.9% overall increase (2.5% annually). In the year after a lumbar facet injection, 26.7% of patients received lumbar RFA; 28.6% received another injection but not RFA; and 44.7% received neither. The number of patients receiving two lumbar facet injection procedures prior to lumbar RFA grew from 51.1% in 2010 to 58.8% in 2016. For lumbar RFA, the cost per 100,000 enrollees went from $94,570 in 2007 to $266,680 in 2016, a 12.2% annual increase. For lumbar facet injections, the cost per 100,000 enrollees went from $257,280 in 2007 to $396,580 in 2016, a 4.9% annual increase.This analysis showed consistent growth in both the frequency and procedure cost of lumbar RFA and facet injections among a large, national, commercially insured population from 2007 to 2016.",0

Therefore, we performed a study to assess the concentrations of plasma lidocaine and its major metabolite (monoethylglycinexylidide [MEGX]) in children receiving continuous thoracic epidural anesthesia after oral clonidine premedication. Ten pediatric patients, aged 1-9 yr, were randomly allocated to the Control or Clonidine 4 microg/kg group (n = 5 each). Anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane in oxygen and air (FIO2 40%). Epidural puncture and tubing were carefully performed at the Th11-12 intervertebral space. An initial dose of 1% lidocaine (5 mg/kg) was injected through a catheter into the epidural space, followed by 2.5 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1). Plasma concentrations of lidocaine and MEGX were measured at 15 min, 30 min, and every 60 min for 4 h after the initiation of continuous epidural injection. The concentrations of lidocaine and MEGX were measured using high-pressure liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Hemodynamic variables were similar between members of the Control and Clonidine groups during anesthesia. The Clonidine group showed significantly smaller lidocaine concentrations (p < 0.05) and the concentration of MEGX tended to be smaller in the plasma of the Clonidine group for the initial 4 h after the initiation of epidural infusion. In conclusion, oral clonidine preanesthetic medication at a dose of 4 microg/kg decreases plasma lidocaine concentration in children.Oral clonidine decreases the plasma lidocaine concentration in children. Our finding may have clinical implications in patients receiving continuous epidural anesthesia. Additionally, perhaps an additional margin of safety regarding lidocaine toxicity is gained through the use of oral clonidine in children who will receive epidural lidocaine.",0

They were randomly allocated into 3 groups: EECP + traction, EECP, and traction group. All patients and 50 healthy volunteers received transcranial color Doppler examination of the vertebral artery and basilar artery in both a neutral cervical spine position and a rotational position.Within 3 days after treatment, 47 (84%) patients in EECP + traction group, 32 (61%) patients in EECP group, and 8 (15%) patients in traction group achieved successful outcomes, while at 3 months' follow-up, 45 (80%) patients in EECP + traction group, 34 (64%) in EECP group, and 3 (6%) in traction group achieved successful outcomes. With head rotation, the percentage of reduction of blood flow velocities of the vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) in patients was much greater than that of the healthy volunteers (P < 0.01). After treatment, rotational blood flow velocity reduction percentage of VBA in each treatment group was much lower than that of each group before treatment. EECP + traction group experienced the greatest decrease of rotational blood flow velocity reduction percentage of VBA, while EECP group experienced second greatest.EECP and traction therapy can relieve the symptoms of rotational VBI, improve the rotational reduction of vertebrobasilar blood flow, and reduce the increased arterial impedance.",0

Entry criteria were ASA status 1 to 3, age 18 to 80 years and written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were patients with cervical instability, known or predicted difficult airway, BMI greater than 40 kg m⁻² and symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux.Two anaesthetists who were experienced in both techniques performed all anaesthesia procedures within the study. There was a maximum of three attempts for performing each technique.The primary outcome was the rate of successful fibreoptic intubation in a neutral position. We also investigated the timing sequence for both techniques, the Brimacombe and Berry Bronchoscopy Score, and differences in technical aspects.All 40 patients in the Aintree group but only 31 patients in the Fastrach group were intubated successfully. Thus, fibreoptic intubation failed significantly less using the Aintree technique (P = 0.002). For secondary outcomes, the cLMA was faster (260 versus 289 s, P = 0.039) and easier (P = 0.036) to insert than the iLMA. The fibreoptic view of the glottis according to the Brimacombe and Berry Bronchoscopy Score was better (P = 0.016) and the tracheal tube was easier to insert (P = 0.010) in the Aintree group.Fibreoptic intubation using the Aintree system was more successful than the Fastrach technique in our population of patients in a neutral position wearing a soft cervical collar. The differences in the time to successful intubation between the two groups are unlikely to be clinically relevant.",0

They then were randomized into four treatment groups: standard care (control), clinical-rehabilitation intervention, occupational intervention, and the Sherbrooke model (a combination of the clinical-rehabilitation and occupational interventions). Functional status, pain level, and work status were assessed at baseline and after 1 year. Duration of full compensation and back-related costs were calculated over a mean follow-up period of 6.5 years. The discriminative validity of the Quebec Task Force Classification was evaluated using Kendall tau correlation coefficients. Predictive validity was evaluated using logistic regression analyses. Age, gender, comorbidities, body mass index, and treatment group were considered as potential confounders.Significant but low correlation coefficients were found between Quebec Task Force Classification categories and functional status scores at baseline. Subjects classified as having distal radiating pain (categories 3 and 4) at baseline were more likely to have a lower functional status, higher pain level, and no return to regular work at the 1-year follow-up evaluation. They also were more likely to accumulate more days of full compensation and to cost more after a mean follow-up period of 6.5 years.The Quebec Task Force Classification demonstrated good predictive ability by discriminating between subjects with and those without distal radiating pain.",0

This was a randomized, single blinded, prospective study. Ninety ASA Grade I–II children weighing 10–20 kg were randomly allocated for PLMA insertion using the digital, introducer tool (IT) or combined IT and stylet techniques. Each group contained 30 patients. Difficult laryngoscopy was simulated using a rigid neck collar. The laryngoscopic view was graded prior to PLMA insertion. The digital and IT techniques were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The combined technique involved attaching the IT to the PLMA and inserting a flexible stylet through the drain tube. The median Cormack and Lehane grade was 2 in all three groups. Insertion was more frequently successful with the combined technique at the first attempt (combined 100%, digital 65.38%, IT 66.67%; p < 0.05), but success after three attempts was similar (combined 100%, digital 86.67%, IT 90%; p > 0.05).

Previous studies have documented that early diagnosis and surgical treatment of CSM may improve patients' neurological as well as general outcome. However, patients complaining of symptoms compatible with CSM may undergo lengthy medical investigations and treatments by community-based physicians before a correct diagnosis is made. The authors have found no published data on the process and time frame involved in attaining a diagnosis of CSM in the community setting.The medical records of 42 patients were retrospectively reviewed for demographic data, symptoms, time to diagnosis, physician specialty, number of visits involved in the diagnostic process, and neurological status prior to surgery.The mean time delay from initiation of symptoms to diagnosis of CSM was 2.2 ± 2.3 years. The majority of symptomatic patients (90.4%) initially presented to a family practitioner (69%) or an orthopedic surgeon (21.4%), with fewer patients (9.6%) referring to other disciplines (for example, the emergency department) for initial care. In contrast, the diagnosis of CSM was most often made by neurosurgeons (38.1%) and neurologists (28.6%), and less frequently by orthopedic surgeons (19%) or family physicians (4.8%).The diagnosis of CSM in the community is frequently delayed, leading to late referral for surgery. A higher index of suspicion for this debilitating entity is required from family practitioners and community-based orthopedic surgeons to prevent neurological sequelae.",0

However, in spite of administration of the hypotensive agents, inadequate analgesia during operation often causes unfavorable and unexpected elevation of blood pressure resulting in excessive bleeding. As well, intractable wound pain sometimes occurs after spinal fusion due to inadequate analgesia during surgery.Forty cases of posterior lumbar spinal fusion were investigated prospectively. Twenty patients underwent preoperative epidural anesthesia with morphine and sedation by continuous intravenous administration of propofol but without administration of any kind of anesthetics, including intraoperative and/or postoperative epidural anesthesia (Group E). Another 20 patients underwent inhalation general anesthesia with sevoflurane and intermittent intravenous administration of fentanyl without any regional block (Group F). In these groups, dynamics and average mean blood pressure during surgery, blood loss during surgery, postoperative requirement of analgesics, the visual analogue scale, and accuracy of neurologic evaluation immediately after surgery were analyzed.The average mean blood pressure during surgery was significantly lower in Group E than Group F: 57.1 mm Hg and 72.8 mm Hg, respectively. In addition, the dynamics of blood pressure were more stable in Group E than Group F. The blood loss during surgery was significantly less in Group E than in Group F: 546 g and 631 g, respectively. The patients of Group E required analgesics after surgery less frequently, and the rating on the visual analogue scale was significantly lower in Group F on the first, second, and third days after surgery. It was difficult to evaluate the neurologic status accurately in 5 patients of Group F because of the inadequate emergence immediately after surgery. There were no patients in Group E whose neurologic status was unclear because of the paralysis caused by epidural anesthesia.To combine preoperative epidural anesthesia with other anesthetic procedure for spinal fusion contributes to maintain more stable hypotension during surgery. As a result, it will be possible to lessen the bleeding during surgery. In addition, the postoperative pain was easily controlled with administration of fewer analgesic agents in patients who underwent the epidural anesthesia. The effectiveness of pre-emptive analgesia should be emphasized to diminish the postoperative pain.",0

This study evaluated an immediate or delayed strategy of bone protection therapy with zoledronic acid.A total of 1065 patients who were receiving adjuvant letrozole were randomized to immediate-start or delayed-start zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously biannually for 5 years). The delayed group received zoledronic acid if lumbar spine or total hip T-score decreased below -2.0 or when a nontraumatic fracture occurred. The primary endpoint was change in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at Month 12. Secondary endpoints included changes in total hip BMD, serum bone turnover markers, and safety at Month 12.Lumbar spine BMD increased from baseline in the immediate arm, while it decreased from baseline in delayed-arm patients.

OBJECTIVE.: Our aim was to determine the incidence and to identify risk factors for surgical site infections (SSIs) in patients undergoing surgery for spinal tumors.SSIs after spinal tumor surgery may be particularly devastating as they may add to substantial surgical morbidity and may further exacerbate already existing neurologic deficits. Incidence and risk factors predisposing to SSIs in patients undergoing surgery for spinal tumors are not well studied yet.Between January 1995 and February 2008, 971 procedures for spinal tumors were performed on 739 patients. Excluding sacral tumors from the current study, 895 procedures on 678 patients were reviewed to identify those cases with SSIs. Furthermore, 65 infected cases and a randomly selected subset of 162 controls were analyzed by logistic regression modeling to identify the risk factors associated with SSIs.There were 678 patients that were included in this study with 364 men (54%) and 314 women (46%), with an average age of 47.2 year. Sixty-five patients who developed SSIs underwent a total of 162 procedures including 78 procedures for wound debridement and washout. The incidence of SSIs was 8.89% for primary nonbony spinal tumors, 9.5% for metastatic spinal tumors, and 13.7% for primary bony spinal tumors. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated organism (n = 22 of 65, 33%). In the multivariate logistic regression model, previous spinal surgeries, complex plastic closures, increasing number of comorbidities, presence of a hospital acquired infection at the time of a previous surgery, and increasing duration of hospital stay during primary surgery were significantly associated with increased likelihood of developing postoperative SSIs.Surgery for spine tumors appears to be associated with a higher incidence of SSI than nontumor spine surgery. Identification of perioperative risk factors will help delineate this subset of patients with high risk for developing SSIs thus potentially allowing perioperative modification for such factors, which may lead to an overall better clinical outcome and patient satisfaction.",0

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a self-administered 3-item questionnaire (3IQ) could reprioritize consultation appointments and reduce wait times for lumbar spinal surgical candidates.This prospective, pragmatic, blinded, randomized controlled quality improvement study was conducted at a single Canadian academic health-care center. This study enrolled 227 consecutive eligible participants with an elective lumbar condition who were referred for consultation with a spine surgeon. All participants were mailed the 3IQ after their referral was received. Patients were randomized into the intervention group, in which leg-dominant pain reported on the 3IQ resulted in an upgrade in priority to be seen, or into the control group, in which no change to wait-list priority occurred. The main outcome measured was time to consultation for participants who were deemed surgical candidates following consultation.There were no significant differences between groups with regard to demographics, overall group wait times, proportion of surgical candidates, or disability. A total of 33 patients were deemed surgical candidates after consultation. The median wait from referral to consultation was shorter for the 16 surgical candidates in the intervention group (2.5 months; interquartile range [IQR]: 2.0 to 4.8 months) compared with the 17 surgical candidates in the control group (4.5 months; IQR: 3.4 to 6.9 months; p = 0.090). The odds of seeing a surgical candidate within the acceptable time frame of 3 months were 5.4 times greater (95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 24.5 times; p = 0.024) in the intervention group.The use of a simple, self-administered questionnaire to reprioritize referrals resulted in shorter consultation wait times for patients who required a surgical procedure and significantly increased the number of surgical candidates seen within the acceptable time frame. It may be valuable to consider adding the 3IQ to clinical care practices to better triage these patients on waiting lists.",0

Innovative technologies have been developed to improve nerve identification and the accuracy of needle placement. The aim of this study was to evaluate three types of ultrasound scans during ultrasound-guided epidural lumbar punctures in a spine phantom.Eleven sets of 20 ultrasound-guided epidural punctures were performed with 2D, GPS, and multiplanar ultrasound machines (660 punctures) on a spine phantom using an in-plane approach. For all punctures, execution time, number of attempts, bone contacts, and needle redirections were noted by an independent physician. Operator comfort and visibility of the needle (tip and shaft) were measured using a numerical scale.The use of GPS significantly decreased the number of punctures, needle repositionings, and bone contacts. Comfort of the physician was also significantly improved with the GPS system compared with the 2D and multiplanar systems. With the multiplanar system, the procedure was not facilitated and execution time was longer compared with 2D imaging after Bonferroni correction but interaction between the type of ultrasound system and mean execution time was not significant in a linear mixed model. There were no significant differences regarding needle tip and shaft visibility between the systems.Multiplanar and GPS needle-tracking systems do not reduce execution time compared with 2D imaging using a real-time ultrasound-guided paramedian sagittal oblique approach in spine phantoms. The GPS needle-tracking system can improve performance in terms of operator comfort, the number of attempts, needle redirections and bone contacts.",0

The aim of this study was to examine its efficacy in chronic neck pain. Forty-two patients with at least 6 weeks of nonspecific neck pain were selected for the study. Data about demographic characteristics including age, sex, body mass index, duration of cervical pain, working status, smoking status, and regular exercise were recorded. Each patient was randomly assigned to Group 1-receiving only standard physical therapy including hot pack, ultrasound therapy and exercise program and Group 2-treated with traction therapy in addition to standard physical therapy. The patients were reevaluated at the end of the therapy. The main outcome measures of the treatment were pain intensity by visual analog scale (VAS), disability by neck disability index (NDI), and quality of life assessed by Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). Twenty-four female and 18 male patients with mean age of 48.2+/-11.5 years and a mean disease duration of 4.3+/-2.9 years were included to the study. There were no differences between the groups in terms of age, sex, pain intensity, and scores of NHP and NDI at entry. There were 21 patients in both groups. Both groups improved significantly in pain intensity and the scores of NDI and physical subscles of NHP at the end of the therapies (p<0.05). There was an association between NDI and VAS pain scores in both groups (p<0.05). No correlation was observed between clinical variables and age and duration of disease. In conclusion, no specific effect of traction over standard physiotherapeutic interventions was observed in adults with chronic neck pain. We suggest the clinicians to consider this condition and to focus on exercise therapy in the management of patients suffering from this condition.",0

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as adjuvant to opioids, improve analgesia and reduce the need for opioids. However, by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase enzymes peripherally, NSAIDs may inhibit bone healing. Acetaminophen, a centrally acting analgesic, does not have the adverse effects of NSAIDs and has improved analgesia in children after another orthopedic surgery.In an institutional review board approved study, 36 American Society of Anesthesiology patient classification I to III patients of 10 to 18 years of age were analyzed. Acetaminophen 30 mg/kg, administered IV or 0.9% NaCl was administered at the end of scoliosis or spondylolisthesis surgery, and thereafter twice at 8-hour intervals. Timed blood samples for acetaminophen determination were taken between 0.25 and 20 hours after the first dose. All patients received standard propofol-remifentanil anesthesia. Pain scores (visual analogue scale [VAS], 0-10), opioid consumption, and adverse effects were recorded.In the surgical ward, 7 (39%) patients in the acetaminophen and 13 (72%) in the placebo group had a VAS pain score 6 or more (P < 0.05). There were fewer hours with VAS score 6 or more in the acetaminophen group compared with the placebo group (8.7% vs. 17.8% of the hours, P < 0.05). There was no difference in oxycodone consumption during the 24-hour follow-up between the 2 groups.IV-administered acetaminophen 90 mg/kg/day, adjuvant to oxycodone, did improve analgesia, but did not diminish oxycodone consumption during 24 hours after major spine surgery in children and adolescents. All acetaminophen concentrations were in nontoxic levels.",0

They also have a high incidence of low vitamin D levels (25-OH-vitamin D <50 nmol/L) that could worsen the negative effect on the bone. In this double-blinded clinical trial, 150 patients with PHPT were randomized, after successful parathyroidectomy (PTX), to 1-year daily treatment with either cholecalciferol 1600 IU and calcium carbonate 1000 mg (D+) or calcium carbonate alone (D-). BMD was measured in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, distal and 33% radius using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) before surgery and after 1 year of study medication. Median age was 60 (range 30-80) years and there were 119 (79%) women and 31 (21%) men; 76% had 25-OH-D <50 nmol/L before PTX and 50% had persistent elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) 6 weeks after PTX. A similar increase in BMD in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip was observed in both groups (D+ : 3.6%, 3.2%, and 2.7%, p<0.001, respectively; and D-: 3.0%, 2.3%, and 2.1%, respectively, p<0.001). Patients with vitamin D supplementation also increased their BMD in distal radius (median 2.0%; interquartile range, -1.7% to 5.4%; p=0.013). The changes in BMD, especially in the hips, were correlated to the baseline concentrations of PTH, ionized calcium, and bone markers (p<0.001). A benefit from vitamin D substitution was observed among patients with a persistent postoperative PTH elevation, who also improved their BMD at 33% radius and radius ultradistal (p<0.05). In conclusion, except for a minor improvement of radius BMD, our data show no beneficial effect on BMD or bone turnover markers of vitamin D supplementation after PTX. Preoperative PTH seems to have the strongest association with improvement in BMD.",0

Progression of DHN and FJOA occurred more frequently at the lumbar than at the thoracic spine and more in women than in men (DHN: odds ratio [OR]=1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.07, 1.88; FJOA: OR=1.70, CI=1.33, 2.17).Prevalence and progression of moderate-to-severe DHN and FJOA are common in non-clinical populations of older adults. The high frequency of spinal degeneration observed on CTs in this community-based study may contribute to challenges in interpreting the clinical significance of imaging evidence of DHN and FJOA. Future studies investigating the association of CT-based spinal degenerative features with pain and functional impairments in population-based samples are needed to help determine the clinical significance of imaged-based findings of DHN and FJOA.",0

We have observed rare cases of side effects in elderly patients, but not in women younger than 30 years.In this pilot study, 96 young women were randomly divided into 3 groups to study the effect of cervical traction with different traction weights on blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, and correlated autonomic adjustment. Cervical traction weight used was 10% of the patient's body weight in group A (n=32), 20% in group B (n=32), and 30% in group C (n=32). Assessments of blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, percentage of high- and low-frequency signals, and low-frequency/high-frequency ratio were performed before, during, and 20 minutes after traction. We found that systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate variability elevated during cervical traction and returned nearly to original levels immediately after traction in group C, but not in groups A or B. There were no significant changes in heart rate, percentage of high- or low-frequency signals, and low-frequency/high-frequency ratio in all 3 groups during or after cervical traction.Cervical traction with a traction weight approximately 10% to 20% of body weight can be safely provided without significant compromise of cardiovascular function. However, heavy traction weight (30% of body weight) should be avoided, especially for a patient with cardiovascular disease.",0

The prone position might facilitate a smoother emergence because the patient is not disturbed. No data describe this technique.Fifty patients were anesthetized with fentanyl, nitrous oxide, isoflurane, and rocuronium. By the conclusion of surgery, all patients achieved spontaneous ventilation and full reversal of neuromuscular blockade in the prone position, as the volatile anesthetic level was reduced. Baseline heart rate and mean arterial pressure were recorded. Patients were then randomized at time 0 to the supine (n = 24) or prone (n = 21) position as 100% oxygen was administered. Patients in the supine position were then rolled over, while those in the prone position remained undisturbed. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and coughs were recorded until extubation. Tracheas were extubated on eye opening or purposeful behavior.When compared with the supine group, prone patients had significantly less increase in heart rate (P = 0.0003, maximum increase 9.3 vs. 25 beats/min), less increase in mean arterial pressure (P = 0.0063, maximum increase 4.8 vs. 19 mmHg), less coughing (P = 0.0004, 7.0 vs. 23 coughs), and fewer monitor disconnections (P < 0.0001). Time to extubation from time 0 was similar (4.0 vs. 3.7 min, prone vs. supine). No one required airway rescue. There was no significant difference in need for restraint (three prone, four supine).Prone emergence and extubation is associated with less hemodynamic stimulation, less coughing, and less disruption of monitors, without specifically observed adverse effects, when compared with conventional supine techniques.",0

A systematic review and meta-analysis,"The problem of imaging patients with low back pain (LBP) when it is not indicated is well recognized. The converse is also possible, although rarely considered. The extent of these two problems is presently unclear.This study aimed to estimate how commonly overuse, and also underuse, of imaging occurs in the management of LBP, and how appropriate use of imaging is assessed.This is a systematic review and meta-analysis.The sample comprised patients with LBP presenting to primary care.Proportions of inappropriate referral, and inappropriate non-referral, for diagnostic imaging for LBP were the outcome measures.MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched from January 1, 1995 to December 17, 2017. Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Meta-analyses were performed where appropriate, and strength of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.Thirty-three studies were included. In patients referred for lumbar imaging, 34.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27.1, 43.3) were judged inappropriate by the absence of red flags for serious pathology and 31.6% (95% CI: 28.3, 35.1) were judged inappropriate by the criteria of no clinical suspicion of pathology. In patients presenting for care, imaging was inappropriately performed in 27.7% of cases (95% CI: 21.3, 35.1) when judged by duration of episode, 9.0% of cases (95% CI: 7.4, 11.0) when judged by absence of red flags, and 7.0% (95% CI: 1.8, 23.3) when judged by no clinical suspicion of pathology. In patients presenting for care, imaging was not performed where appropriately indicated in 65.6% (95% CI: 51.8, 77.2) of patients who presented with red flags, and 60.8% (95% CI: 42.0, 76.8) with clinical suspicion of serious pathology.Inappropriate imaging is common in LBP management, including both overuse in those where imaging is not indicated and underuse of imaging when it is indicated. Appreciating that both underuse and overuse can occur is fundamental to efforts to improve imaging practice to align with current guidelines and best evidence.",0

Therefore, modulating the excitability of cortical areas involved in pain processing may become an attractive option in the context of multimodal analgesia during the postoperative period. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can reduce morphine consumption during the postoperative period after gastric bypass surgery. We tested the potential of another method of noninvasive brain stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), to reduce morphine consumption or pain perception during the postoperative period.Fifty-nine ASA I to II patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery were randomized to receive anodal (n=20), cathodal (n=20), or sham (n=19) tDCS in the recovery room in a double-blind manner. Morphine consumption administrated through patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was the primary outcome; pain perception as measured by visual analog scale was the secondary outcome.There were no statistically significant differences between the 3 groups of patients, either for PCA morphine consumption or for pain scores.Several factors may explain the observed lack of impact of tDCS on PCA morphine consumption and pain perception: the method of brain stimulation (tDCS/rTMS), potential interactions with anesthetic drugs, differences in patients population (gastric bypass surgery/lumbar spine surgery), and the previous experience of pain and chronic consumption of analgesic drugs. Further studies with tDCS should be performed before concluding that tDCS is inefficient for postoperative pain control, because noninvasive brain stimulation methods, such as rTMS and tDCS, may become attractive in the setting of multimodal analgesia.",0

In group II patients, the epidural catheter was inserted at the T6-8 level. In all patients, anesthesia was standardized with the use of lidocaine, fentanyl, and thiopental. Indocyanine green clearance test values before general anesthesia (T0), after induction of general anesthesia (T1), after transection (T2), and at postoperative 24 and 72 hours were recorded. Simultaneously, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, albumin, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase values were analyzed.Plasma disappearance rate (PDR) and retention at 15 minutes (R15) of indocyanine green were not statistically significant difference between groups (P > .05).

Research Methods and Procedures: Bone mineral density and bone mineral content (BMC) were examined in 44 RYGB women (≥3 years post-surgery; 31% weight loss; BMI, 34 kg/m2) and compared with age- and weight-matched control (CNT) women (n = 65). In a separate analysis, RYGB women who presented with low bone mass (n = 13) were supplemented to a total 1.2 g Ca/d and 8 μg vitamin D/d over 6 months and compared with an unsupplemented CNT group (n = 13). Bone mass and turnover and serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured. Results:Bone mass did not differ between premenopausal RYGB and CNT women (42 ± 5 years), whereas postmenopausal RYGB women (55 ± 7 years) had higher bone mineral density and BMC at the lumbar spine and lower BMC at the femoral neck. Before and after dietary supplementation, bone mass was similar, and serum PTH and markers of bone resorption were higher (p < 0.001) in RYGB compared with CNT women and did not change significantly after supplementation. Discussion: Postmenopausal RYGB women show evidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, elevated bone resorption, and patterns of bone loss (reduced femoral neck and higher lumbar spine) similar to other subjects with hyperparathyroidism. Although a modest increase in Ca or vitamin D does not suppress PTH or bone resorption, it is possible that greater dietary supplementation may be beneficial.",0

Findings: Total procedure time and success rate of LSGB were not statistically different between the US group and the fluoroscopy group, without any serious complications. Meaning: US-assisted LSGB appears to be feasible and safe method although an advantage of US-assisted LSGB was not found compared with fluoroscopy-guided LSGB in terms of performance time. Lumbar sympathetic ganglion block (LSGB) is a widely performed procedure to diagnose and manage diseases with sympathetically maintained pain,1 including complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) types I and II, neuropathies—such as postherpetic neuralgia, stump or phantom limb pain, and diabetic polyneuropathy—and ischemic pain due to vascular insufficiency in the lower leg.1–3 Fluoroscopy (FL)-guided LSGB has been a popular technique, as it provided great accuracy in confirming the location of needle tip or intravascular (IV) injection. However, this technique exposes patients to radiation and its success rate ranges from 67% with FL guidance2 to 83% with computed tomography (CT) guidance.4 Ultrasound (US)-guided or assisted techniques have been introduced to the field of pain medicine in the mid-2000s. US guidance has been shown to be associated with many advantages, including minimal radiation exposure, as well as the ability to visualize soft tissue structures and observe needle insertion and spread pattern of injectate in real time.5 However, US guidance techniques have also been shown to have several shortcomings, including difficulty with visualization of deeper structures, lack of confirmation/prevention of IV injection, and a success rate dependent on the knowledge and technique of the physician. As US guidance has undergone technical advancements, its applicability expanded from peripheral blocks to deep neuraxial blocks. A recent technical description of US guidance LSGB in a patients with CRPS type I showed that the anterior fascia of the psoas muscle and the anterolateral part of vertebral body are key landmarks during the procedure.6 Another study also reported that the psoas muscle in the lumbar paravertebral space, an anatomical key for US-guided LSGB, was visualized in approximately two-third of patients.7 US-guided methods can be performed in conjunction with FL-guided techniques if the target structures, such as lumbar axial and para-axial structures, are deeply located.8–10 These structures are frequently located beneath the lumbar vertebrae, obstructing a clear visualization of the needle tip; thus, unintended injections including IV access may occur during a US-guided procedure if not conducted together with FL guidance. US-assisted LSGB, which refers to US-guided LSGB in conjunction with FL, may be expected to provide real-time visualization of the needle tip location with respect to the anterior fascia of the psoas major muscle in paravertebral space with an advantage of low radiation exposure. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies that compared US-assisted LSGB with FL-guided LSGB. We hypothesized that US-assisted LSGB may result in a shorter procedure time compared with FL-guided LSGB. This prospective, randomized, comparative study was designed to compare the procedural outcomes in terms of the procedure time and success rates between FL-guided and US-assisted LSGBs. METHODS Participants Our study was approved by the institutional review board of Seoul National University Hospital and registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02737527). All methods and results have been reported according to the Equator guidelines.11 Patients undergoing the LSGB procedure between May and December 2016 in Seoul National University Hospital were included, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before the procedure. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age between 18 and 80 years old; (2) pain syndromes that require LSGB procedures (eg, pain with asymmetric skin temperature of lower limb in previous thermography, small fiber disorder in previous quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test or other electrophysiology tests, vascular insufficiency in lower extremities, diabetic polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, CRPS types I and II, cancer-related neuropathic pain, such as chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, or other lower extremity neuropathies), which had been refractory to conservative treatment for 3 or more months; and (3) a score of 4 or more on an 11-point numerical rating pain scale. The exclusion criteria included the following: (1) a body mass index (BMI) of >30 kg/m2; (2) a history of post-lumbar laminectomy with internal fixation or any severe anatomic variation, such as scoliosis and tumor; (3) any history of lumbar sympathetic chemical or thermal neurolysis; (4) pregnancy; (5) infection at the puncture site; (6) coagulopathy; (7) allergy to local anesthetics; and (8) any cognitive dysfunction or inability to provide informed consent. Randomization Randomization was performed, with an allocation ratio 1:1, by a pain physician who was only in charge of randomization. A computer-generated, random number table (Random Allocation Software Version 1.0; Saghaei M, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran) was used. Using sequential numbers on opaque and sealed envelopes, each injection was allocated to one of the 2 groups: the FL-guided LSGB group (FL group) or US-assisted LSGB group (US group). Once patients were given a subject identification code, a corresponding envelope with the number was delivered to the pain physician, keeping the seal intact. The pain physician opened it just before the procedure and performed the assigned procedure. Data collection was conducted by the blinded independent research coordinator who was not involved in the performance of the procedure. Procedures An experienced pain physician (J.Y.M.) performed all the operations to minimize procedural variations. Patients were transferred to the operating room and were continuously monitored with noninvasive blood pressure and pulse oximetry during and after the procedure. Patients were placed in a prone position with a pillow under the lower abdomen and iliac crest to reduce lumbar lordosis, and temperature probes were tightly attached to both soles using transparent patches (Teraderm; 3M Healthcare, St. Paul, MN). After sterilizing the skin around the puncture sites, their body, including both feet, was covered by a sterile surgical drape for temperature stabilization. LSGBs were performed at the lower third of the L2 or the upper third of the L3 vertebra without any premedication. The targeted lumbar vertebra was identified with an anteroposterior (AP) fluoroscopic imaging in the FL group or with an US longitudinal tracing approach from the caudad to cephalad direction in the US group. The skin entry point was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine. Then, a curved 21 G, 15-cm Chiba needle (Cook Inc, Bloomington, IN) was advanced toward the target using the posterolateral approach in both groups. In the FL group, procedures were performed in the following manner. FL-guided LSGB was performed at the lower third of the L2 or the upper third of the L3 vertebra. A targeted lumbar vertebra was identified by AP imaging, and the C-arm was adjusted 25°–35° laterally to avoid transverse process during insertion of the needle. After infiltrating the skin, the needle was advanced toward the anterolateral edge of the target lumbar vertebra, using FL guidance, via a tunnel vision technique. Lateral FL image was obtained to confirm that the needle tip reached the anterior two-third of the L3 vertebral body. The needle was then advanced to the anterolateral margin of the vertebral body, and the final needle position was confirmed using the AP, lateral, and oblique views. After verifying negative aspiration for blood or cerebrospinal fluid, 3 mL of contrast dye was administered incrementally to confirm sympathetic spread and 10 mL of 0.25% levobupivacaine was injected. In the US group, a portable US image device (S-Nerve; FUJIFILM SonoSite Inc, Bothell, WA) with 5–2-MHz low frequency probe (C60x; FUJIFILM SonoSite Inc, Bothell, WA) was used to perform LSGB. To identify the target vertebra (L2 or L3), the lumbosacral junction (L5–S1 gap) was located on a paramedian sagittal scan; then the lamina and transverse processes of the L3, L4, and L5 vertebrae were confirmed cranially. After identifying the level of L2 and L3 vertebrae, a modified transverse scanning of the lumbar paravertebral region (through lumbar intertransverse space) was performed with a transducer, which was positioned 4–6 cm laterally to the midline in a transverse orientation at the L2 vertebral level (Figure 1) or L2 to L3 intervertebral level (Figure 2).9,12 The transducer was also directed medially to insonate the anterior fascia of the psoas major muscle through the lumbar intertransverse space. The target of the needle tip was located anteriorly and medially to the psoas major muscle,6 which was on the anterolateral aspect of the lumbar vertebral body (Figure 2). The color Doppler was utilized to determine the presence of vascular structures and to plan a needle trajectory (Figure 2). Before needle insertion, the lower part of the kidney—located approximately at the L3 vertebral level on the left side and slightly lower on the right—was visualized and confirmed that it was not in the way of the needle path (Figure 3). The needle was inserted from the lateral to the medial direction, using an in-plane technique, and was monitored in real time during needle advancement. Hydrodissection technique with 1.5 mL of normal saline was used in some cases to identify the exact location of the needle tip. After confirming the final position of the needle tip and negative aspiration for blood or cerebrospinal fluid, 3 mL of the contrast dye was administered incrementally to exclude vascular injection with a C-arm image intensifier (Ziehm Vision R; Ziehm Imaging, Nuremberg, Germany) on both the AP and lateral views. A sympathetic spread of the contrast dye was confirmed, and 10 mL of 0.25% levobupivacaine was injected.Figure 1.: A modified transverse image of the lumbar paravertebral region at the L2 vertebral level. Kd indicates kidney; L, lamina; Ps, psoas major muscle; QL, quadratus lumborum muscle; TP, transverse process; VB, vertebral body or intervertebral disk.Figure 2.: A modified transverse image of the lumbar paravertebral region through the L2 and L3 intertransverse space.

The injectate is spread ventral to the psoas muscle. The left kidney is out of the needle path. Arrows showed needle shaft, and arrow heads point to the spread of local anesthetics. Ps indicates psoas major muscle.In successful LSGBs, the sympathetic spread pattern of the contrast was linear along the longitudinal axis without any lateral or posterior extension, or any prominent psoas muscle shadow. Transient patterns may suggest vascular uptake. If the spread pattern was not satisfactory in both groups, the location of the needle tip was adjusted or the needle was reinserted as appropriate. The final depth of the Chiba needle, as well as the width from the midline to the insertion site, was measured in both groups. To monitor skin-surface temperatures as an index of successful LSGB, adhesive thermocouple probes with transparent patches were attached to the bilateral plantar surface. The baseline temperature was obtained just before the insertion of Chiba needle (at least 10 minutes after full draping). Temperatures were measured and recorded from the time of 0.25% levobupivacaine administration with 1-minute intervals for a maximum of 20 minutes. Outcome Measurement The primary end point was the total procedure time, defined as the time from the first radiographic image for the identification of the lumbar vertebral level to the completion of the levobupivacaine injection (FL group), or the time from the US probe placement on the patient’s skin to the completion of the levobupivacaine injection (US group). Secondary end points were several procedure-related outcomes, including success rate, imaging time, onset time for temperature rise, bone touching, frequency of needle adjustment, and spread pattern of contrast medium. Success of LSGB was determined by the temperature rise of the ipsilateral sole as high as 2°C within 20 minutes after levobupivacaine injection.2 The imaging time was the time needed for identification of the vertebral level and imaging optimization, defined as the time from the first image taken after sterile preparation and draping to the skin infiltration with local anesthetic in the FL group, or the time from the transducer placement to the skin infiltration with local anesthetic in the US group. The onset time was defined as the time needed for the temperature to rise as much as 2°C after levobupivacaine injection. Bone touching was also recorded in both groups if, during the procedure, there was contact between the bone and the needle. The number of needle passes was recorded to measure the needle adjustment during LSGB. The initial needle insertion was counted as 1 pass and an additional pass was regarded as any subsequent needle reinsertion or adjustment that is followed by a withdrawal of the first pass with >1 cm. Procedure-related complications, such as pain or radiation dose, were recorded. In the recovery room, pain related to the LSGB procedure was assessed based on an 11-point numerical rating pain score scale (0 = none, 10 = most severe). In-room radiation exposure was measured and displayed through the monitor of C-arm image intensifier (Ziehm Vision R). Adverse events, such as genitofemoral nerve block, lumbar plexus block (transient unilateral leg weakness), or others, were observed during and after the procedure. The patients were discharged after confirmation that there were no serious adverse events. Sample Size Calculation and Statistical Analysis Sample size calculation was based on the result of pilot study of 5 patients using G*power 3.1 (Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany). The total procedure time for FL-guided LSGB was 482 ± 186 seconds. The effect size for a clinically relevant difference was a 30% difference in the total procedure time between FL-guided and US-assisted groups. A sample size of 23 subjects in each group provided 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.8 between the 2 groups with an α of .05. Twenty-five patients were calculated for each group allowing for a 10% drop-out rate. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 21.0 statistical software (IBM, Armonk, NY). The intention-to-treat approach was used for data analysis. Data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation or the number (%). For continuous variables, the normality distribution was checked with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, and an independent t test was used to compare the normally distributed variables. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables without a normal distribution. Chi-square test or Fisher exact test was used to analyze all categorical data. This study was powered to test a single primary outcome; therefore, no multiple comparison adjustments were made. All P values presented are 2-sided, and P values of <.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS A total of 50 LSGB procedures were performed from May to December 2016 in Seoul National University Hospital, and 4 procedures were removed from the data analysis since 2 patients received 2 LSGBs. The patient and procedure characteristics are presented in Table 1. In terms of the lumbar spinal level for LSGB, the majority of LSGBs was performed in the L3 vertebra in the FL group. In the US group, the incidence of the L2–L3 intervertebral level was 52.0% and that of the L2 vertebra was 17.4%. A multivariate regression was performed to explore any influence of lumbar spinal level on our primary outcome, and there was no statistically significant difference in our result. Therefore, lumbar spinal level, as a covariate, was not considered to influence on our primary outcome.Table 1.: Characteristics of Patients and ProceduresProcedure-related outcomes are presented in Table 2. The primary outcome was the total procedure time, and the total procedure time (344.7 ± 67.7 seconds for the FL group and 374.4 ± 50.6 seconds for the US group; P = .099) was not significantly different between the 2 groups.Table 2.: Procedure-Related OutcomesTable 3.: Procedure-Related ComplicationsSecondary end points were several procedure-related outcomes, including success rate, imaging time, onset time for temperature rise, bone touching, frequency of needle adjustment, and spreading pattern of contrast medium. No statistically significant difference between the 2 groups was observed in success rate (74% for the FL group and 65% for the US group; P = .749). The imaging time (the level identification and imaging optimization) was significantly longer in the US group than in the FL group (64.3 ± 24.4 vs 49.1 ± 13.0 seconds; P = .012) (Table 2). The onset time for obtaining a temperature increase of 2°C or more in successful LSGB was significantly shorter in the US group than in the FL group (406.3 ± 89.6 vs 476.2 ± 112.6; P = .019). There were less occurrences of bone touching in the US group than in the FL group with statistical significance (22% vs 74%; P = .001). Otherwise, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to temperature changes and frequency of needle adjustment during LSGB (Table 2). The most common spread pattern of the contrast medium in both groups was sympathetic chain (70% for the FL group and 56% for the US group). There was no case of an IV uptake pattern of the contrast medium in the US group (Table 2). The initial spread to the psoas muscle was more common in the US group (44%), and the IV uptake of the initial spread was only observed in the FL group (9%). Procedure-related complications are presented in Table 3. There was no significant difference in procedure-related pain between the 2 groups (6.9 ± 2.1 in the FL group and 5.8 ± 2.1 in the US group; P = .084; Table 3). Minor pain after LSGB was reported at the puncture site (5 patients in the FL group and 4 patients in the US group; P = 1.000), and such pain was transient and completely relieved within 1 month after the procedure. Radiation exposure was significantly lower in the US group than in the FL group (61.0 ± 35.2 vs 156.0 ± 95.8; P < .001). No serious complications, including sensory deficit related to genitofemoral nerve block or lumbar plexus block, hypotension, infections, hematoma, or motor dysfunction, were observed. DISCUSSION To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective, randomized, comparative clinical trial to investigate the procedural outcomes of US-assisted LSGB compared with FL-guided LSGB. We found that the procedure time and success rate were similar between the 2 groups, while imaging time (duration for level identification and imaging optimization) was longer in the US-assisted LSGB group than in the FL-guided LSGB group. Additionally, US-assisted LSGB was associated with a more rapid onset time for temperature rise, less bone touching during the procedure, and less radiation exposure compared with FL-guided LSGB. Lumbar sympathetic ganglion in the retroperitoneal connective tissue is located anteriorly in the vertebral bodies and the medial margin of the psoas muscle, which are the 2 landmarks of US-assisted LSGB.13 The aorta and the inferior vena cava are anteriorly located to lumbar sympathetic ganglion, whereas the kidney and ureter are posterolaterally located to the lumbar sympathetic ganglion. Four lumbar sympathetic ganglia were reported to exist on the L2 vertebra, L2–L3 disk, L3–L4 disk, and L5 vertebral level.14 A block at the upper level of the L3 vertebra or at the L2–L3 intervertebral disk may successfully denervate the sympathetic supply of the limb since all the sympathetic fibers pass through or synapse at the L2 ganglion. In 1992, Kirvelä et al15 first reported the technique of US-guided LSGB chemical neurolysis, but there has not been any comparative, randomized trial with LSGB under US guidance. In our study, there was no statistically significant difference in the total procedure time between FL-guided and US-assisted LSGBs. The actual procedure time in the US group may be regarded to be shorter than that in the FL group because the imaging time for level identification and imaging optimization was longer in the US group than that in the FL-guided group. FL-guided LSGB is not a simple and easy procedure considering the deep location of LSGB and a success rate of 67%.2 In this study, the success rate was 74% and 65% in the FL-guided group and US-assisted group, respectively. A previous study on CT-guided LSGB showed a success rate of 83% from improved visualization of the needle tip and dye spread pattern on the axial anatomic images.16,17 However, using CT is associated with higher radiation exposure, higher cost of equipment, and the need for a radiologist. A clear visualization of the anteromedial fascia of the psoas muscle and the anterolateral side of the vertebral body is necessary for a successful US-guided LSGB. In our study, clear visualization of the psoas muscle was achieved in only 70%, which resulted in a successful US-assisted LSGB rate of 65%. Several factors affect the visibility of US imaging, including BMI, age, and the angle of needle path. BMI has been reported to be one of the important factors for needle visualization; the range of BMI in the present study was 16.9–27.3 kg/m2. Therefore, US-assisted LSGB might only be used in patients with a low BMI, specifically, BMI of <30 kg/m2. Regarding age, old age is one of the reasons for failure of US-assisted lumbar spinal procedures. Muscle echogenicity is known to significantly increase with age; white and brighter US images are observed in elderly patients compared with younger patients.18 Finally, a steep angle of the needle path might prevent a clear visualization of the needle shaft and tip during US-assisted LSGB. Several studies investigated the reliability of US-guided procedures on the lumbar spine. The success rate of US-guided facet joint block was over 90%.10,19–21 Due to the deeper location of lumbar sympathetic ganglia, US-guided LSGB may be considered as a more complicated procedure than the US-guided facet block. US-guided lumbar transforaminal epidural injection was reported to have a success rate of 90% with the spread of contrast media into the intraforaminal space.9 However, the spinal nerve is located ventrally to the intertransverse ligament, and the needle tip is shadowed by the bony structures as it passes below the lamina.9 Therefore, further advancement of the needle tip may lead to permanent spinal nerve damage. Additionally, inadvertent IV injections during US-guided lumbar transforaminal epidural injection cannot be recognized without contrast-enhanced FL. There was no incidence of IV uptake during US-assisted LSGB in this study. A previous investigation reported an IV uptake of 12.5% of contrast dye during FL-guided LSGBs,13 and the incidence of IV uptake in the current study was 9% in the FL-guided group. This is likely due to the needle tip touching the lateral margin of the L3 or L2 vertebra during placement. The needle tip should be kept close to the vertebral body to reach the target point, and this may result in trauma of the perivertebral vessels or IV uptake into the lumbar segmental vessels. A reduction of the needle touching the lateral vertebral body during US-assisted LSGB may prevent IV uptake of the contrast media. There are several limitations in the present study. First, a single pain physician (J.Y.M.) performed all LSGBs to maintain uniformity in performing the procedures, and therefore, the results of this study are not generalizable to all pain specialists with varying levels of experience in musculoskeletal sonography. Second, improvement of pain score in the lower leg after LSGB procedure was not included as part of the outcomes, and symptom relief may be considered the gold standard for evaluating the success of US-assisted pain interventions. Instead, the accurate needle location and temperature increase in the lower extremity were chosen as the outcomes of the present study, since LSGB is usually performed for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Third, patients with BMI >30 kg/m2 were excluded from the study because obesity has been shown to negatively impact US imaging. A low BMI (16.9–27.3 kg/m2) in the present study may explain the relative, comparable results of the US-guided and FL-assisted groups and likely limit the generalizability of the findings of our study. Fourth, multiple comparisons were not performed for the several secondary outcomes because these were not primary objectives of our study. In conclusion, US-assisted LSGB appears to be a feasible and safe method without serious complication although an advantage was not found for US-assisted LSGB in terms of performance time. Additionally, US-assisted LSGB may provide advantages, including visualization of key soft tissue structure (kidney), and low radiation exposure. A study with a larger sample size is needed to better understand the efficacy and safety profile of US-guided or assisted LSGB.

Alendronate (bisphosphonate) has proven its efficacy for the treatment of osteoporosis of the lumbar spine and femoral neck. A few in vitro studies have pointed out its inhibiting effect on particle-induced osteolysis. In vivo, one study has demonstrated its usefulness in preventing osteolysis around non-cemented total hip arthroplasties (THA). The purpose of this work was to study the efficacy of this agent for the prevention of changes in peri-prosthetic bone mineral density (BMD) after primary THA.The study series included 38 patients with degenerative hip disease who underwent THA. The patients were randomized in double-blind fashion to two treatment arms: 10 alendronate and 600 mg calcium per day for 2 years (20 patients) or placebo and 600 mg calcium per day for 2 years (18 patients). Conventional x-rays and x-ray biphotonic absorptiometry (DPX) was performed on day four postop and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postop. The periprosthetic zones described by Grüen were used for analysis.DPX demonstrated a significant reduction in BMD in all patients included in the study. The bone loss was the same in both groups during the early postoperative period reaching maximum loss at 3 months. Differences were observed after this time. In the placebo group, bone loss reached a plateau at 6 months then BMD started to increase progressively, reaching 12.7% bone loss at 2 years follow-up (p<0.002). In the alendronate group, there was no plateau, BMD increased continuously starting from three months and reached 6.857% bone loss at 2 years (p<0.003).Administration of alendronate led to a significant reduction in peri-prosthetic bone loss at 2 years follow-up. These results are the first to our knowledge demonstrating the beneficial effect in vivo of alendronate on bone behavior around cemented THAs.This beneficial effect observed in vivo should be confirmed in further studies including a larger number of patients and longer follow-up. The action of alendronate could facilitate and even retard revision surgery by preserving bone stock.",0

The aims of this study were: (1) to measure changes in bone mineral density (BMD) over time; (2) to correlate the degree of bone loss with the severity of liver disease; and (3) to characterize bone disease in PBC patients receiving regular calcium and vitamin D supplementation.We enrolled 118 women with PBC (mean age+/-SD: 56+/-11 y; 72% postmenopausal; 43% with cirrhosis), and measured BMD (lumbar spine, DXA-Hologic) at entry and serially over the following 5 years. The controls were 472 healthy women selected from a large observational group matched for age and menopausal status (mean age+/-SD: 55+/-10 y; 73% postmenopausal).Mean BMD was 0.851+/-0.142 g/cm2 in the PBC group and 0.857+/-0.158 g/cm2 in the control group; the prevalence of osteoporosis was 28% and 29%, respectively. BMD significantly correlated with age and postmenopausal status, but not with liver cirrhosis or serum bilirubin levels. The biochemical markers of bone turnover were high in about 50% of the patients. The yearly bone loss in the PBC group was 0.008 g/cm2 (95% confidence interval: 0.014-0.003) similar to that calculated in the control group.Among patients with PBC, the prevalence of osteoporosis and the yearly rate of BMD loss are similar to those observed in the general population, and are not associated with the severity of liver disease.",0

Recent evidence indicates that thoracic epidural blockade may be of benefit during sepsis by improving gut perfusion. This study was planned to evaluate whether combining thoracic epidural blockade with general anaesthesia could decrease the post-operative mortality and morbidity in patients with sepsis due to perforation peritonitis.This randomised non-blinded study included consenting adult patients of the American Society of Anesthesiologists grade II-III, undergoing emergency laparotomy for small intestinal perforation peritonitis. Severity of illness was evaluated using Mannheim Peritonitis Index, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score and clinical indicators of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Patients were randomised into two groups depending on the anaesthetic technique [general anaesthesia combined with thoracic epidural block (group GT) and general anaesthesia (group GA), n = 33 each. The thoracic block was extended from T5 to T10 using 0.125% bupivacaine in aliquots of 2-3 ml, with 50 μg fentanyl. Post-operatively, patients were followed for occurrence of any major morbidity till discharge from hospital, and 30-day mortality. 'Major morbidity' included development of organ failure. Post-operative markers for gut motility and perfusion, that is, time to passage of flatus, stools, resumption of oral feeds and occurrence of anastomotic leak were also observed. Sample size was calculated at power of 80% and α error of 0.05, aiming to detect a decrease of 50% in the incidence of post-operative major morbidity or mortality.Patients in the two groups were similar with respect to demographic profile and severity of sepsis. The number of patients with major morbidity or 30-day mortality were statistically similar between the two groups (group GT, 0/33; group GA 4/33; P = 0.114). A significantly shorter time to pass stools and resume oral feeds in group GT (4 ± 2 vs. 3 ± 1 days) (P = 0.006 and 0.012, respectively) and lesser incidence of anastomotic leak (0/33 vs. 4/33; P = 0.114) showed earlier recovery of gut motility and perfusion in that group.Use of intra-operative segmental thoracic epidural blockade performed in addition to general anaesthesia suggested some benefit in improving post-operative mortality or major morbidity, but the trend was not significant, perhaps due to the small sample size. There was, however, a significantly earlier return of bowel motility and earlier discharge from hospital.",0

The group of 190 patients were further split into a group of 90 patients who had contralateral hip impairment, knee or spine problems, or significant comorbidities and into a group of 100 patients who had unilateral hip arthropathy.

In a randomized, controlled, double-blinded prospective trial, 54 patients received either conventional patient-controlled IV analgesia (PCIA; morphine 3 mg/15 min) or patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA; 0.125% ropivacaine plus sufentanil 1 μg/mL at a base rate of 12 mL/h and bolus application of 5 mL/15 min). Circulating cytokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), cortisol, and cell-surface receptor expression of immune cells (cluster of differentiation [CD]14, human leukocyte antigen-DR, CD86, CD71, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, and CD19) were measured perioperatively to characterize immunological functions. PCEA, compared with PCIA, had no influence on altered levels of circulating cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage inhibitory factor) or indicators of the stress response (CRP and cortisol). Also, no significant difference was found in monocyte numbers or their human leukocyte antigen-DR, CD86, or CD71 expression. In contrast, the postoperative decrease in B lymphocytes and T-helper cells was significant in the PCEA group. Natural killer cells decreased significantly in patients receiving PCEA compared with PCIA. Therefore, postoperative epidural pain therapy has no influence on monocyte functions but reduces natural killer cells and preserves B-cell and T-helper cell populations. Epidural analgesia thus influences the specific rather than the innate immune system and potentially blunts the postsurgical lymphocyte depression, which is relevant for infectious resistance. IMPLICATIONS: Epidural analgesia affects the immune system. Postoperative epidural analgesia, compared with conventional IV opioid therapy, preserves lymphocyte rather than monocyte functions. An improvement of postoperative immune function by epidural analgesia therefore may improve postoperative resistance to infectious complications or to chronic pain states.",0

Weight loss, however, has adverse effects on bone health in obese individuals without cancer but this has not been evaluated in breast cancer survivors. We investigated the associations of intentional weight loss with bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turn-over markers in overweight/obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Participants were overweight/obese breast cancer survivors (N = 81) with stage I, II or IIIA disease enrolled in the St. Louis site of a multi-site Exercise and Nutrition to Enhance Recovery and Good health for You (ENERGY) study; a randomized-controlled clinical trial designed to achieve a sustained ≥7 % loss in body weight at 2 years. Weight loss was achieved through dietary modification with the addition of physical activity. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess differences in mean values between follow-up and baseline. Mean weight decreased by 3 and 2.3 % between baseline and 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up, respectively. There were decreases in osteocalcin (10.6 %, p value < 0.001), PINP (14.5 %, p value < 0.001), NTx (19.2 % p value < 0.001), and RANK (48.5 %, p value < 0.001), but not BALP and CTX-1 levels between baseline and 12-month follow-up. No significant changes occurred in mean T-scores, pelvis and lumbar spine BMD between baseline and 12-month follow-up. A 2.3 % weight loss over 12 months among overweight/obese women with early-stage breast cancer does not appear to have deleterious effect on bone health, and might even have beneficial effect. These findings warrant confirmation, particularly among breast cancer survivors with a larger magnitude of weight loss.",0

Supraglottic airway devices can be important alternatives for oxygenation under these circumstances. The Ambu laryngeal mask (ALM) and the LMA-Classic (LMA) are compared in patients with immobilization of the cervical spine. METHODS: In 60 patients scheduled for elective ambulatory interventions, ALM or LMA were inserted after cervical immobilization with an extrication collar and assessment of laryngoscopic view. Insertion time (removal of facemask until first tidal volume), number of insertion attempts, airway leak pressure (cuff pressure 60 cm H(2)O), intraoperative complications and postoperative complaints were assessed. RESULTS: Demographical data, insertion attempts, insertion time (ALM 15.6+/-4.4 s, LMA 15.5+/-4.9 s) and airway leak pressure (ALM 25.6+/-5.2 cm H(2)O, LMA 26.5+/-6.5 cm H(2)O) were comparable. Traces of blood were found in 6 LMAs and 3 ALMs after removal, mild trouble with swallowing (visual analogue scale, VAS 2-4) in the recovery room and after 24 h were complaints by 1 ALM and 2 LMA patients. CONCLUSIONS: LMA-Classic and Ambu laryngeal masks are suitable for rapid and reliable airway management in patients with cervical immobilization.",0

Regional anesthesia options are limited and include intrathecal opioid and epidural analgesia; however, they remain little used because of side effects and inconsistent efficacy. We describe a novel multimodal anesthetic regimen incorporating bilateral bi-level erector spinae plane (ESP) blocks together with a combination of several evidence-based intraoperative opioid-sparing analgesic strategies.MethodsTwo healthy young adult patients with idiopathic scoliosis underwent posterior spinal fusion involving 12 vertebral levels (T2–L1 and T3–L2). Bilateral single-injection ESP blocks were performed at two levels (T4 and T10) prior to incision. Intraoperatively, patients received intravenous dexamethasone and infusions of dexmedetomidine and ketamine for multimodal analgesia. Remifentanil was omitted from the total intravenous anesthetic regimen to avoid opioid-induced hyperalgesia.ResultsBoth patients had minimal pain on emergence. They transitioned successfully to oral analgesia on the first postoperative day, with modest opioid requirements, no side effects, and low pain scores throughout their hospital stay.ConclusionBilateral bi-level ESP blocks are a simple method of providing pre-emptive regional analgesia in extensive multi-level spine surgery. Integration of ESP blocks into a multimodal regimen that employs other opioid-sparing strategies may have additive, and potentially synergistic, benefits in improving postoperative analgesia and reducing opioid requirements.",0

Patients and Methods CT-guided cement augmentation was performed on 100 patients with a total of 168 non-dislocated insufficiency fractures, 50 patients being treated with RFS and 50 patients with CSP. Leakages were detected by CT. Pain intensity was determined on a VAS before and after the intervention. The patientsʼ self-sufficiency was assessed using the Barthel index. Patients were asked about any complications and their level of satisfaction. Costs incurred for carrying out the procedure were compared with the respective reimbursements received. Results Both procedures were technically fully feasible. No leakages were found in the RFS group, as opposed to 8.1% asymptomatic leakages in the CSP group. The mean value for pain before intervention was 8.8 in the RFS group and 8.7 in the CSP group. On the second postoperative day, there was a significant pain reduction with a value of 2.4 for both groups, which remained more or less constant over the follow-up period. The Barthel index increased significantly from an average of 30 before the intervention to 80 on the fourth postoperative day and 70 after 24 months. No differences were found between the two procedures with regard to pain, improvement in functional status and satisfaction. Taking into account the state-wide base rate used for calculating reimbursement, 3,834.75 € remained for RFS and 5,084.32 € for CSP. Conclusion RFS and CSP are minimally invasive procedures that achieve equally good and sustained pain reduction, leading to markedly improved self-sufficiency of the patients. With regard to possible cement leakages, RFS is the safer method. A profit can be generated with both techniques.",0

Under general anesthesia, an ND:YAG LASER was used to apply 2000 J of energy to 5 cervical articular facet joints in 3 horses (15 joints total). Horses were euthanized and the cervical facets and spinal cords were examined grossly and histologically. Gross pathology of the articular facets revealed evidence of articular cartilage charring and diffuse roughening of the surface. Histopathology confirmed coagulative necrosis. This novel technique allowed access to the cervical articular facet joints with the ND:YAG LASER and has the potential to allow performance of a minimally invasive facilitated ankylosis procedure. Further validation in sedated, standing horses is required to establish safety and efficacy of this technique.Développement d’une approche minimalement invasive pour les facettes vertébrales lombaires équines pour le placement d’un LASER ND:YAG.

The subjects were anesthetized with 11-12 mg of intrathecal isobaric bupivacaine (0.5%), and an epidural catheter was placed at Th 11/12, and was connected to a pressure transducer to continuously monitor thoracic epidural pressure. We analyzed epidural pressure, blood pressure, and heart rate 5 min after administering intrathecal bupivacaine (SAB5m), immediately before skin incision (pre-incision), immediately after delivery of the placenta (placenta-del), and 5 min after delivery of the fetus (CS5m).In both groups, epidural pressures were found to be elevated after delivery compared with their levels before the skin incisions were made, (P < 0.0001). Epidural pressures at placenta-del (P = 0.0055) and CS5m (P < 0.0001) were higher than at SAB5m in the ergometrine group. Epidural pressures at placenta-del were also higher than at SAB5m in the oxytocin group (P < 0.0001). Epidural pressures at placenta-del were lower in the ergometrine group compared with the oxytocin group (P = 0.0122), but epidural pressures at CS5m were higher in the ergometrine group compared with the oxytocin group (P < 0.0001).We conclude that there is an increase in thoracic epidural pressure after fetal delivery, which appears to be associated with uterine contraction.",0

Therefore, the objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of ibandronate to reduce fractures after LTX. Seventy-four patients after LTX were included in the study and measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spine and proximal femur using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) were performed prior to and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. The study group (IBA) consisted of 34 patients who received calcium (1 g/day), vitamin D3 (800-1000 IE/day) and ibandronate 2 mg every 3 months intravenously for 1 year. The control group consisted of 40 patients (CON) who received calcium and vitamin D3 at the same dosages. Prevalence of new fractures was predefined as primary endpoint. Changes of BMD and biochemical markers of bone metabolism were also investigated. In all patients, we found a reduction of BMD in the first few months after LTX. In the lumbar spine and the proximal femur the maximum reduction occurred 3 and 6 months post-LTX. One and 2 years after transplantation, the group receiving ibandronate demonstrated a better recovery from loss of BMD and a significantly lower prevalence of fractures (IBA 2 vs. CON 10 P < 0.04, chi(2)). Ibandronate with calcium and vitamin D3 reduces the BMD-loss after LTX and decreases the rate of bone fractures significantly.",0

The aim of this study was to compare upper cervical spine extension during endotracheal intubation using three different techniques.Duration of intubation and movement of upper cervical vertebrae during endotracheal intubation were compared in 33 patients undergoing lumbar laminectomy. Patients requiring tracheal intubation under general anaesthesia and neuromuscular blockade were randomly allocated into three groups - direct laryngoscopy, intubating laryngeal mask (LM) airway and fibreoptic laryngoscopy. The procedure was recorded by video-fluoroscopy and analysed with computer-assisted measurements. The maximum movement of the C1/C2 and C2/C3 vertebrae during intubation were obtained. Data were analysed using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni and Kruskal-Wallis tests.We found statistically significant movement between the first and second, but not between the second and third cervical vertebrae. The mean (+/-SD) movement at C1/C2 was 10.2 +/- 7.3 degrees with direct laryngoscopy, 5.0 +/- 6.3 degrees with LM and 1.6 +/- 3.2 degrees with fibreoptic laryngoscopy. This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.01) between the direct and fibreoptic laryngoscopy groups. The maximum movement at C2/C3 was 2.2 +/- 10.1 degrees with direct laryngoscopy, 3.5 +/- 5.1 degrees with LM and 0.5 +/- 3.2 degrees with fibreoptic laryngoscopy. Duration of intubation was significantly longer in the intubating LM group (P < 0.001).We conclude that fibreoptic laryngoscopy is the more suitable intubation technique when cervical spine movement is not desired.",0

Comparing differences between surgeons from a single institution, thereby omitting regional variation, could aid in identifying factors associated with higher costs and individual drivers of costs. The use of decision aids (DAs) has been suggested as one of the possible tools for diminishing costs and cost variation.(1) To determine factors associated with higher costs for treatment of spinal stenosis in the first year after diagnosis in a single institution; (2) to find individual drivers of costs for providers with higher costs; and (3) to determine if the use of DAs can decrease costs and cost variability.Retrospective cohort study.A total of 10,858 patients in 18 different practices diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis between January 2003 and July 2015 in three associated hospitals of a single institution.Mean cost for a patient per provider in US dollars within 1 year after diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis.We collected all diagnostic testing, office visits, injections, surgery, and occupational or physical therapy related to lumbar spinal stenosis within 1 year after initial diagnosis. We used multivariable linear regression to determine independent predictors for costs. Providers were grouped in tiers based on mean total costs per patient to find drivers of costs. To assess the DAs effect on costs and cost variability, we matched DA patients one-to-one with non-DA patients.Male gender (β 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05-0.15, p<.001), seeing an additional provider (β 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.86, p<.001), and having an additional spine diagnosis (β 0.79, 95% CI 0.74-0.84, p<.001) were associated with higher costs. Providers in the high cost tier had more office visits (p<.001), more imaging procedures (p<.001), less occupational or physical therapy (p=.002), and less surgery (p=.001) compared with the middle tier. Eighty-two patients (0.76%) received a DA as part of their care; there was no statistically significant difference between the DA group and the matched group in costs (p=.975).Male gender, seeing an additional provider, and having an additional spine diagnosis were independently associated with higher costs.

Oral and intravenous calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonates have been used to treat BMD but with low efficiency due to their limited absorption and patient compliance. Denosumab is a new drug that helps prevent osteoclast development and activation and led to decreased bone resorption in some studies. The aim of this study was to assess its value in HPN patients.Between November 2011 and March 2013, 49 patients receiving HPN (29 women, 20 men, mean age 55.3 years) who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to a denosumab or control group. Regional dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of the spine and hip was performed before therapy and after 12 months. BMD, T score, and z score were assessed.Fifteen patients received 2 doses of therapy and were fully reassessed after 1 year. At baseline and after 12 months, the absorptiometry revealed T scores of -3.439 standard deviations (SD) vs -2.33 SD at lumbar segment 2 (L2) and -2.957 SD vs -2.067 SD at lumbar segment 3 (L3), z scores of -2.24 SD vs -1.36 SD at L2 and -1.995 vs -1.067 SD at L3, and BMD of 0.801 vs 0.946 at L2 and 0.857 vs 0.979 at L3, respectively.

Using continuous cinefluoroscopy, we conducted a prospective study comparing C-spine movement during intubation using direct laryngoscopy (DL) or GlideScope videolaryngoscopy (GVL), with uninterrupted manual in-line stabilization of the head by an assistant.Twenty patients without C-spine pathology were studied. After induction of general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade, both DL and GVL were performed on every patient in random order. Cinefluoroscopic images of C-spine movement during GVL and DL were acquired and divided into four stages: a baseline image before airway manipulation, glottic visualization, insertion of the endotracheal tube into the glottis, and tracheal intubation. Peak segmental motion from the occiput to C5 was measured offline for each patient and each stage, averages were calculated, and movements induced by each instrument were compared using a two-way ANOVA. Also studied were the proportion of patients with occiput-C1 rotation exceeding 10, 15, or 20 degrees, and the quality of glottic visualization.No significant difference was found between DL and GVL regarding average segmental spine movement at any level (P values between 0.22 and 0.70). During both techniques, motion was mainly an extension concentrated in the rostral C-spine and occurred predominantly during glottic visualization. The proportion of patients with occiput-C1 extension of more than 10, 15, or 20 degrees was not significantly different. Glottic visualization was significantly better with GVL compared with DL.During intubation under general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade and manual in-line stabilization, the use of GVL produced better glottic visualization, but did not significantly decrease movement of the nonpathologic C-spine when compared with DL.",0

Additionally, we aimed to determine the time that the effects of traction last. Material and methods Thirty apparently healthy subjects (age: 20.9 ± 1.7 years old), 14 male and 16 female, were submitted to two protocols of 15 minutes of continuous traction (with intensity of 10% and 50% of body weight), in two sessions one week apart. The protocol order was determined randomly. Stature was assessed before and immediately after the traction and every five minutes for 30 minutes after traction ceased. Results Immediately after the traction both protocols induced a significant increase in stature, however the magnitude of the increase was significantly superior in the traction with 50% of body weight (0.567 ± 0.049 vs. 0.298 ± 0.041 cm, p>0.001). After the traction with 50% of body weight the increase in the stature was maintained until ten minutes after the end of the traction, while after the traction with 10% of body weight the effects on stature disappeared after five minutes. Conclusions The mechanical vertebral traction of the lumbar region performed continuously with 50% of body weight during 15 minutes induced an increase in stature superior and longer in time than that observed with a traction force of 10% of body weight.",0

Each student was allowed up to three intubation attempts with each device, in each scenario. The Airtraq, McCoy, and the ILMA each demonstrated advantages over the Macintosh laryngoscope. In both the easy and difficult airway scenarios, the Airtraq, McCoy, and the ILMA reduced the number of intubation attempts, and reduced the number of optimisation manoeuvres required. The Airtraq and ILMA reduced the severity of dental trauma in both scenarios. The performance of the other devices studied was more variable. Overall, participants found that only the Airtraq was less difficult to use and they were more confident using it compared to the Macinosh laryngoscope.",0

This study was designed to evaluate the effects of preconditioning of electro-acupuncture on postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly.Ninety patients scheduled spine surgery were randomly assigned into 2 groups using a random number table: control group (group C) and electro-acupuncture group (group EA). In group EA, electro-acupuncture was applied on Baihui, Dazhui, and Zusanli acupoints 30 minutes before anesthesia. At 0 minute before treatment of electro-acupuncture, 1 hour after skin incision and surgery completed (T1-3), blood samples were taken for detection of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and S100β by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The total dose of remifentanil and propofol during surgery were recorded. Mini-Mental State Examination was applied to evaluate the cognitive function of patients at 1 day before surgery and 7th and 30th day after surgery.The results showed that compared with group C, score of MMSE increased after surgery, the serum concentration of IL-6, IL-10, and S100β decreased at 1 hour after skin incision, and surgery completed in group EA. Moreover, the total dose of remifentanil and propofol reduced during surgery in group EA.The present study suggests that preconditioning of electro-acupuncture could improve the postoperative cognitive function, and the reduction of inflammatory reaction and brain injury may be involved in the mechanism.",0

Posture changes can lead to psychosocial and physical impairments in adolescents with IS. Therefore, it is important to assess posture, but the test-retest reliability of posture measurements still remains unknown in this population.The primary objective of the present study was to determine the test-retest reliability of 25 head and trunk posture indices using the Clinical Photographic Postural Assessment Tool (CPPAT) in adolescents with IS. The secondary objective was to determine the standard error of measurement and the minimal detectable change.This is a prospective test-retest reliability study carried out at two tertiary university hospital centers.Forty-one adolescents with IS, aged 10-16 years old with curves 10°-45° and treated by medical intervention, were recruited.Two posture assessments were done using the CPPAT 5-10 days apart following a standardized procedure. Photographs were analyzed with the CPPAT software by digitizing reference landmarks placed on the participant by a physiotherapist evaluator. Generalizability theory was used to obtain a coefficient of dependability, standard error of measurement, and the minimal detectable change at 90% confidence interval.Fourteen of 25 posture indices had a good reliability (ϕ≥0.78), 10 had moderate reliability (ϕ=0.55-0.74), and 1 had poor reliability (ϕ=0.45). The most reliable posture indices were waist angle asymmetry (ϕ=0.93), right waist angle (ϕ=0.91), and frontal trunk list (ϕ=0.92). Right sagittal trunk list was the least reliable posture index (ϕ=0.45). The MDC90 values ranged from 2.6 to 10.3° for angular measurements and from 8.4 to 35.1 mm for linear measurements.The present study demonstrates that most posture indices, especially the trunk posture indices, are reproducible in time among adolescents with IS and provides reference values. Clinicians and researchers can use these reference values to assess change in posture over time attributable to treatment effectiveness.",0

This prospective and randomized study was undertaken to evaluate skeletal effects of delayed surgical treatment in such patients. <h3>Methods</h3> Fifty patients with mild PHPT (serum calcium, 2.55 to 2.95 mmol/L; 10.2 to 11.8 mg/dL) were randomized to parathyroidectomy either at diagnosis or 1 year later. Hip and spine bone mineral density (BMD, determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), bone alkaline phosphatase in serum, osteocalcin and β-CrossLaps in plasma, and calcium in urine were measured in all patients at inclusion in the study and 1 and 2 years later. <h3>Results</h3> The skeletal effects of mild PHPT varied with anatomy and time of exposure. Parathyroidectomy decreased all biochemical bone markers (<i>P</i> < .0001) and increased lumbar spine BMD (<i>P</i> < .05) equally in both groups, even in patients without overt osteoporosis, whereas hip BMD was increased (<i>P</i> < .05) in the early intervention group only. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Prolonged exposure to mild and seemingly stable PHPT is a risk factor for hip fractures, which adds to other reasons for surgical treatment of this condition without delay regardless of serum calcium levels.",0

The primary outcome measure was cuff integrity by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 12 months postoperatively. Secondary clinical outcome measures were American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Rowe, Simple Shoulder Test, Constant, and Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation scores.The mean MRI interval was 12.6 months (range, 12-17 months). A total of 3 of 20 single-row repairs and 3 of 20 double-row repairs (15%) had tears at follow-up MRI. The single-row group had re-tears in 1 single tendon repair and 2 double tendon repairs. All 3 tears failed at the original attachment site (Cho type 1). In the double-row group, re-tears were found in 3 double tendon repairs. All 3 tears failed medial to the medial row near the musculotendinous junction (Cho type 2). All clinical outcome measures were significantly improved from the preoperative level (P < .0001), but there was no statistical difference between groups postoperatively.There is no MRI difference in rotator cuff tendon re-tear rate at 12 months postsurgery between a triple-loaded single-row repair or a suture-bridging double-row repair when both are augmented with platelet-rich plasma fibrin membrane. No difference could be demonstrated between these repairs on clinical outcome scores.I, Prospective randomized study.",0

However, it is very difficult to measure the serum estradiol levels precisely in women receiving oral conjugated equine estrogen, which is a mixture of estrogens. In the present study, we precisely measured the serum levels of estradiol in postmenopausal women undergoing hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and we clarified the relationships between serum estradiol levels and the effects of HRT on the Kupperman index, bone mineral density (BMD), serum gonadotropin, lipid metabolism and unscheduled bleeding as the clinical endpoints.Sixty-eight postmenopausal or bilaterally ovariectomized women, aged 30-64 years, who had been suffering from vasomotor symptoms such as hot flush or atrophy of the vagina were randomly assigned to two groups: one group of 34 patients who received oral administration of 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogen (CEE, Premarin, Wyeth) and 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, Provera, Upjohn) every other day, and another group of 34 patients who received oral administration of 0.625 mg CEE and 2.5 mg MPA every day. All subjects were re-classified into three groups according to the serum estradiol level after 12 months of treatment: (1) low estradiol group (<15 pg/ml, n = 25); (2) middle estradiol group (> or =15 and <25 pg/ml, n = 27), and (3) high estradiol group (> or =25 pg/ml, n = 16). We examined the relationships between serum estradiol level and the effects of estradiol on the Kupperman index, BMD, serum gonadotropin levels, lipid profile and unscheduled bleeding in these three groups.RESULTS obtained by using our newly developed high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-radioimmunoassay (RIA) system clearly showed that the effects on each tissue in postmenopausal women receiving oral CEE and MPA is closely related to estradiol level. The effects of HRT on BMD, serum gonadotropin levels and lipid profile were shown to be clearly dependent on the serum estradiol levels, while the effect of HRT on the Kupperman index was independent of the serum estradiol level. Furthermore, it was also found that a very low concentration of estradiol (<15 pg/ml) was sufficient to suppress the serum LH and FSH levels and to relieve vasomotor symptoms, and that the minimum concentration of estradiol required to increase BMD was 15 pg/ml. On the other hand, the level of estradiol required to reduce total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (Apo B) was found to be more than 25 pg/ml, while the level required to increase high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1) was at least 15 pg/ml. The incidence of unscheduled bleeding was also lower in the low estradiol group than in the other estradiol level groups.These results suggest that the different clinical endpoints have different response thresholds and thus reflect tissue sensitivity to estradiol levels achieved by HRT.",0

Part 1. Methods and alarm criteria,"Object Reports of the accuracy of existing neuromonitoring methods for detecting or preventing medial malpositioning of thoracic pedicle screws have varied widely in their claimed effectiveness. The object of this study was to develop, test, and validate a novel neuromonitoring method for preventing medial malpositioning of pedicle screws in the thoracic spine during surgery. Methods This is a prospective, blinded and randomized study using a novel combination of input (4-pulse stimulus trains delivered within the pedicle track) and output (evoked electromyography from leg muscles) to detect pedicle track trajectories that—once implanted with a screw—would cause that screw to breach the pedicle's medial wall and encroach upon the spinal canal. For comparison, the authors also used screw stimulation as an input and evoked electromyogram from intercostal and abdominal muscles as output measures. Intraoperative electrophysiological findings were compared with postoperative CT scans by multiple reviewers blinded to patient identity or intraoperative findings. Results Data were collected from 71 patients, in whom 802 screws were implanted between the T-1 and L-1 vertebral levels. A total of 32 screws ended up with screw threads encroaching on the spinal canal by at least 2 mm. Pulse-train stimulation within the pedicle track using a ball-tipped probe and electromyography from lower limb muscles correctly predicted all 32 (100%) of these medially malpositioned screws. The combination of pedicle track stimulation and electromyogram response from leg muscles proved to be far more effective in predicting these medially malpositioned screws than was direct screw stimulation and any of the target muscles (intercostal, abdominal, or lower limb muscles) we monitored. Based on receiver operating characteristic analysis, the combination of 10-mA (lower alarm) and 15-mA stimulation intensities proved most effective for detection of pedicle tracks that ultimately gave rise to medially malpositioned screws. Additional results pertaining to the impact of feedback of these test results on surgical decision making are provided in the companion report. Conclusions This novel neuromonitoring approach accurately predicts medially malpositioned thoracic screws. The approach could be readily implemented within any surgical program that is already using contemporary neuromonitoring methods that include transcranial stimulation for monitoring motor evoked potentials.",0

Following the investigation, we allowed the 101 patients (65 men and 36 women) in group A to sit or stand freely, while we confined the 106 patients (62 men and 44 women) in group B to bed for 20 hours. The nine patients in group B who could not maintain bed rest were excluded. There was no significant difference between the two groups as regards the prevalence of spinal headache (8.9% in group A v 14.4% in group B). Patients who reported headaches, however, were significantly more likely to be women (18.7%) than men (7.3%), be younger (mean age 45 years v 56 years), have a higher cerebrospinal pressure before removal of fluid (mean values 172 v 137 mm H 2 O) and a lower systolic (mean values 120 v 134 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure. We conclude that, although other factors may be associated with headaches, late ambulation is not effective in preventing spinal headaches after lumbar myelography.",0

Obesity is increased among FM patients and associates with higher levels of pain. Symptom improvement after aerobic exercise is affected by body mass index (BMI) in FM. Metabolic factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and leptin may be involved. In this study, the aim was to evaluate the role of metabolic factors in lean, overweight and obese women during resistance exercise, in relation to symptom severity and muscle strength in women with FM.Forty-three women participated in supervised progressive resistance exercise, twice weekly for 15-weeks. Serum free and total IGF-1, IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), adiponectin, leptin and resistin were determined at baseline and after 15-weeks. Level of current pain was rated on a visual analogue scale (0-100 mm). Level of fatigue was rated by multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI-20) subscale general fatigue (MFIGF). Knee extension force, elbow flexion force and handgrip force were assessed by dynamometers.Free IGF-1 (p = 0.047), IGFBP3 (p = 0.025) and leptin (p = 0.008) were significantly decreased in lean women (n = 18), but not in the overweight (n = 17) and the obese (n = 8). Lean women with FM benefited from resistance exercise with improvements in current pain (p= 0.039, n = 18), general fatigue (MFIGF, p = 0.022, n = 18) and improved elbow-flexion force (p = 0.017, n = 18). In overweight and obese women with FM there was no significant improvement in pain or fatigue but an improvement in elbow flexion (p = 0.049; p = 0.012) after 15 weeks of resistance exercise.The clearest clinical response to resistance exercise was found in lean patients with FM. In these individuals, individualized resistance exercise was followed by changes in IGF-1 and leptin, reduced pain, fatigue and improved muscular strength. In overweight and obese women FM markers of metabolic signaling and clinical symptoms were unchanged, but strength was improved in the upper limb. Resistance exercise combined with dietary interventions might benefit patients with FM and overweight.The trial was registered 21 of October 2010 with ClinicalTrials.gov identification number: NCT01226784 .",0

Study conducted from August 2013 to February 2014.In total, 68 patients scheduled for elective renal surgery (open nephrectomy or open nephron-sparing surgery).Preoperative ThPVB with 0.5% bupivacaine combined with general anaesthesia, followed by postoperative oxycodone combined with nonopioid analgesics as rescue drugs. Follow-up period: 48 h.Total dose of postoperative oxycodone required, pain intensity, occurrence of opioid related adverse events, ThPVB-related adverse events and patient satisfaction.A total of 68 patients were randomised into two groups and, of these, 10 were subsequently excluded from analysis. Patients in group paravertebral block (PVB; n = 27) had general anaesthesia and ThPVB, and those in group general (anaesthesia) (GEN) (n = 31) formed a control group receiving general anaesthesia only. Compared with patients in group GEN, patients who received ThPVB required 39% less i.v. oxycodone over the first 48 h and had less pain at rest (P < 0.01) throughout the first 24 h. Group PVB patients also experienced fewer opioid-related adverse events and were less sedated during the first 12 postoperative hours. Patients in the PVB group had higher satisfaction scores at 48 h compared with the control group. There were no serious adverse events.In our study, preoperative ThPVB was an effective part of a multimodal analgesia regimen for reducing opioid consumption and pain intensity. Methods and drugs used in both groups were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Compared with the control group, patients in the ThPVB group reported increased satisfaction.Clinical Trials NCT02840526.",0

Nevertheless, the biomechanics of intubation (cervical spine motion as a function of applied force) have not been characterized. This study characterized and compared the relationship between laryngoscope force and cervical spine motion using two laryngoscopes hypothesized to differ in force. Methods: Fourteen adults undergoing elective surgery were intubated twice (Macintosh, Airtraq). During each intubation, laryngoscope force, cervical spine motion, and glottic view were recorded. Force and motion were referenced to a preintubation baseline (stage 1) and were characterized at three stages: stage 2 (laryngoscope introduction); stage 3 (best glottic view); and stage 4 (endotracheal tube in trachea). Results: Maximal force and motion occurred at stage 3 and differed between the Macintosh and Airtraq: (1) force: 48.8 ± 15.8 versus 10.4 ± 2.8 N, respectively, P = 0.0001; (2) occiput-C5 extension: 29.5 ± 8.5 versus 19.1 ± 8.7 degrees, respectively, P = 0.0023. Between stages 2 and 3, the motion/force ratio differed between Macintosh and Airtraq: 0.5 ± 0.2 versus 2.0 ± 1.4 degrees/N, respectively; P = 0.0006. Discussion: The relationship between laryngoscope force and cervical spine motion is: (1) nonlinear and (2) differs between laryngoscopes. Differences between laryngoscopes in motion/force relationships are likely due to: (1) laryngoscope-specific cervical extension needed for intubation, (2) laryngoscope-specific airway displacement/deformation needed for intubation, and (3) cervical spine and airway tissue viscoelastic properties. Cervical spine motion during endotracheal intubation is not directly proportional to force. Low-force laryngoscopes cannot be assumed to result in proportionally low cervical spine motion.",0

We designed this study to determine which anesthetic regimen allows a rapid wake-up test during and after surgery to detect neurological deficits. Fifty-four patients were randomly allocated to the following groups: group PR (propofol/remifentanil): target-controlled infusion with propofol (plasma concentration, 2-4 microg/mL) and remifentanil 0.2-0.5 microg . kg(-1) . min(-1); group PS (propofol/sufentanil): propofol (2-4 microg/mL) and repetitive boluses of 0.1-0.2 microg/kg of sufentanil adjusted to patients requirements; and group DR (desflurane/remifentanil): desflurane/air 3.0-4.0 vol% combined with remifentanil 0.2-0.5 microg . kg(-1) . min(-1). Group PS required significantly longer times for the onset of breathing (8.9 +/- 1.6 min), elevation of the head (17.0 +/- 3.8 min), and motion of the feet (17.0 +/- 7.4 min) than group PR (6.9 +/- 2.6 min, 9.3 +/- 2.2 min, and 9.4 +/- 2.4 min, respectively) or group DR (5.4 +/- 0.8 min, 6.1 +/- 1.0 min, and 6.2 +/- 1.0 min, respectively). The anesthetic regimen with desflurane and remifentanil allowed faster awakening during and after surgery that permitted immediate neurological examination after spinal surgery compared with propofol/remifentanil.",0

However, MEPs are known to be particularly sensitive to the suppressive effects of inhalational halogenated anesthetic agents.To investigate the effects of increasing end-tidal concentrations of desflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia in a background of propofol and remifentanil with multipulse cortical stimulation on intraoperative monitoring of MEPs.In this randomized crossover trial, 14 consecutive patients (7 in each arm) undergoing major spine surgery, under a background anesthetic of propofol (75 to 125 mcg/kg/min) and remifentanil (0.1 to 0.2 mcg/kg/min), were randomly assigned to receive the sequence of inhalational agents studied: either DES-SEVO (desflurane followed by sevoflurane); or SEVO-DES (sevoflurane followed by desflurane). Multiples (0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) of minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of desflurane and sevoflurane were administered. After a washout period of 15 minutes using high fresh oxygen/air flows, each of the patients then received the other gas as the second agent. Cortical stimulation was achieved with a train of 5 equivalent square pulses, each 0.05 ms in duration, delivered at 2 ms intervals. MEP recordings were made in the upper limb (UL) from first dorsal interosseus and lower limb (LL) from tibialis anterior with subdermal needle electrodes.At 0.3 MAC desflurane, there was no statistical significant difference in transcranial-evoked MEP amplitudes from the baseline in both UL and LL stimulation. However, this was not the case for sevoflurane for which even a low concentration at 0.3 MAC significantly depressed MEP amplitudes of LL (but not UL) from baseline value. Desflurane at 0.5 and 0.7 MAC depresses LL MEP to 58.4% and 59.9% of baseline, respectively (P<0.05), whereas sevoflurane at 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 MAC depresses LL MEP to 66.2%, 41.3%, and 25.3% of baseline, respectively (P<0.05). There was no difference in latency of the responses at any MAC.Inhalational anesthetic agents (sevoflurane >desflurane) suppress MEP amplitudes in a dose-dependent manner. The use of 0.3 MAC of desflurane (but not sevoflurane) provided good MEP recordings acceptable for clinical interpretation for both upper and LLs. The LL appears to be more sensitive to anesthetic-induced depression compared with the UL. All patients studied had normal neurological examination hence, these results may not be applicable to those with preexisting deficits.",0

The patients in group A (n = 24, average age 54 years old) were performed decompressive laminectomy, intertransverse process arthrodesis with bone grafting and transpedicle instrumentation of solid connection (SOCON) system. The patients in group B (n = 21, average age 53 years old) were performed the same procedure as group A except adding posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PROSPACE). The main levels of lumbar spondylolisthesis in 2 groups was L(4 - 5) or L(5)-S(1). All cases were classified as degree 1 to degree 2. All patients in the two groups received preoperative myelography or CTM, and were diagnosed lateral recess stenosis and(or) central lumbar canal stenosis.All the patients were followed up from 12 to 72 months. In group A, the results showed that the preoperative clinical symptoms disappeared completely in 12 of 24 patients, pain relief was seen in 91.7% (22/24), anatomical reduction rate was 91.7%. No infection or neurologic complication occurred in this series. In group B, the results showed that the preoperative clinical symptoms disappeared completely in 13 of 21 patients, pain relief was seen in 90.5% (19/21), anatomical reduction rate was 95.2%. Four cases of infection or neurologic complication occurred in this series. Two groups had no significant difference in follow-up clinical outcome and anatomical reduction rate. But group A had better intraoperative circumstances and postoperative outcome than group B, group B had better postoperative parameters in X-ray of angle of slipping and disc index than group A.The best surgical treatment method of lumbar stenosis with low degree lumbar spondylolisthesis is complete intraoperative decompressive laminectomy, reduction with excellent transpedicle system instrumentation and solid fusion after bone grafting. The use of cage should be conformed to strict indications.",0

Some prior studies have suggested that epidural anesthesia with or without postoperative epidural analgesia may blunt the surgical stress response after major surgery. This treatment approach has not been fully investigated for patients undergoing major spinal surgery. We hypothesized that the stress response after major spine surgery would be attenuated by continuous epidural anesthesia/analgesia with ropivacaine, fentanyl, and epinephrine.Eighty-five patients were randomly allocated to 2 groups as follows: group E (n = 45) had epidural anesthesia and endotracheal anesthesia with sevoflurane during surgery and continuous epidural analgesia with ropivacaine, fentanyl, and epinephrine after surgery; group G (n = 40) had general anesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl and systemically administered opioids after surgery. Patient pain, nausea, mobility, and satisfaction were measured after surgery along with levels of cortisol, glucose, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 during and after surgery.In group E, there were significantly less pain, less nausea, earlier mobility, and higher satisfaction than those in group G. Group E also experienced significantly less introperative and postoperative blood loss. Group E demonstrated lower levels of glucose, cortisol, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 during the postoperative period.Combined epidural/general anesthesia and postoperative epidural analgesia produced better pain control, less bleeding, and a lower surgical stress response than general anesthesia with postoperative systemically administered narcotic analgesia. This technique deserves further study in the setting of major spinal surgery.",0

The groups were comparable with respect to demographic variables. Fifteen minutes after the conclusion of the epidural injection, the sensory block ranged from from T4 [median, interquartile range 2.75 segments] to T11 (interquartile range 3.5 segments) in the control group and from T5 (interquartile range 2.25 segments) to L2 (IQR 2.25 segments) in the continuous positive airway pressure group (P = 0.005 for the caudal border). The total number of segments blocked was 7 (median, interquartile range 2.25) in the control group and 11 (interquartile range 3.5) in the continuous positive airway pressure group (P = 0.004). The number of segments blocked caudad to the injection site was 3 (median, interquartile range 3.5) in the control group and 6 (interquartile range 2.25) in the continuous positive airway pressure group (P = 0.005). We conclude that continuous positive airway pressure increases the spread of sensory blockade in thoracic epidural anesthesia, primarily by a more caudad extension of sensory blockade.",0

The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of curve morphology on the response to bracing with a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO).A retrospective review of patients managed with an orthosis for the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis who were prospectively enrolled at the initiation of brace wear and followed through completion of bracing or surgery was performed. Inclusion criteria were main curves of 25° to 45° and a Risser stage of 0, 1, or 2 at the time of brace prescription. Compliance with bracing was measured with Maxim Integrated Thermochrons. Radiographs made at brace initiation, brace cessation, and final follow-up were used to retrospectively categorize curves with use of the modified Lenke (mLenke) classification system and more broadly to categorize them as main thoracic or main lumbar. The effect of morphology on outcome was evaluated using chi-square and Fisher exact tests.One hundred and sixty-eight patients were included. There was no difference in curve magnitude at the time of brace initiation (p = 0.798) or in average hours of daily brace wear (p = 0.146) between groups. The rate of surgery or progression of the curve to ≥50° was 34.5% (29 of 84) in mLenke-I curves, 54.5% (6 of 11) in mLenke-II curves, 29.4% (10 of 34) in mLenke-III curves, 17.6% (3 of 17) in mLenke-V curves, and 13.6% (3 of 22) in mLenke-VI curves. There were no mLenke-IV curves at the time of brace initiation. The rate of surgery or progression to ≥50° was 34.1% (44 of 129) in the combined thoracic group and 15.4% (6 of 39) in the combined lumbar group (p = 0.0277). In brace-compliant patients (>12.9 hours/day), the rate of surgery or progression to ≥50° was 30.3% (20 of 66) in main thoracic curves and 5.3% (1 of 19) in main lumbar curves (p = 0.0239). One-tenth of curves changed morphology during bracing. The rate of surgery or progression to ≥50° was 35.8% (43 of 120) in persistent main thoracic curves, 20.0% (6 of 30) in persistent main lumbar curves, 12.5% (1 of 8) in main thoracic curves that became main lumbar curves, and 0% (0 of 9) in main lumbar curves that became main thoracic curves (p = 0.0383).Thoracic curves are at greater risk for brace failure than lumbar curves are despite similar initial curve magnitudes and average amount of daily brace wear. A change in curve pattern may imply flexibility and is associated with brace success. Patients with thoracic curves should be counseled accordingly.Prognostic Level III.

Risk of bias of the studies was assessed. The primary outcomes evaluated were spinal cord compression.Three RCTs (5274 patients) were included. Denosumab was not significantly superior to ZA in reducing the likelihood of spinal cord compression, when all tumor types were combined (odds ratio [OR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI; 0.66, 1.28], P = .66). Denosumab was not significantly favored over ZA in endodermal origin (breast and prostate; OR 0.72, 95% CI [0.43, 1.19], P = .20) and mesodermal origin tumors (solid tumors and multiple myeloma; OR 1.10, 95% CI [0.72, 1.69], P = .66).Denosumab does not significantly reduce the likelihood of spinal cord compressions in comparison to ZA in patients with spine metastases. When spinal cord compressions were grouped by tumor origin (endodermal or mesodermal), there remained no significant difference between denosumab and ZA. Further long-term studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these treatment regimens.",0

However, the predictors of these strategies have not been studied extensively in patients with whiplash-associated disorders (WAD).The purpose of this study was to predict chronic pain acceptance and engagement in activities at 1-year follow-up with pain intensity, fear of movement, perceived responses from significant others, outcome expectancies, and demographic variables in patients with WAD before and after multimodal rehabilitation (MMR).The design of this investigation was a cohort study with 1-year postrehabilitation follow-up.The subjects participated in MMR at a Swedish rehabilitation clinic during 2009-2015.The patients had experienced a whiplash trauma (WAD grade I-II) and were suffering from pain and reduced functionality. A total of 386 participants were included: 297 fulfilled the postrehabilitation measures, and 177 were followed up at 1 year after MMR.Demographic variables, pain intensity, fear of movement, perceived responses from significant others, and outcome expectations were measured at the start and after MMR. Chronic pain acceptance and engagement in activities were measured at follow-up.The data were obtained from a Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation (SQRPR).Outcome expectancies of recovery, supporting and distracting responses of significant others, and fear of (re)injury and movement before MMR were significant predictors of engagement in activities at follow-up. Pain intensity and fear of (re)injury and movement after MMR significantly predicted engagement in activities at follow-up. Supporting responses of significant others and fear of (re)injury and movement before MMR were significant predictors of pain acceptance at the 1-year follow-up. Solicitous responses of significant others and fear of (re)injury and movement at postrehabilitation significantly predicted pain acceptance at follow-up.For engagement in activities and pain acceptance, the fear of movement appears to emerge as the strongest predictor, but patients' perceived reactions from their spouses need to be considered in planning the management of WAD.",0

Methods A total of 229 participants were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive intraarticular facet injections with bupivacaine and steroid, medial branch blocks, or saline. Those with a positive 1-month outcome (a 2-point or more reduction in average pain score) and score higher than 3 (positive satisfaction) on a 5-point satisfaction scale were followed up to 6 months. Participants in the intraarticular and medial branch block groups with a positive diagnostic block (50% or more relief) who experienced a negative outcome proceeded to the second phase and underwent radiofrequency ablation, while all saline group individuals underwent ablation. Coprimary outcome measures were average reduction in numerical rating scale pain score 1 month after the facet or saline blocks, and average numerical rating scale pain score 3 months after ablation. Results Mean reduction in average numerical rating scale pain score at 1 month was 0.7 ± 1.6 in the intraarticular group, 0.7 ± 1.8 in the medial branch block group, and 0.7 ± 1.5 in the placebo group; P = 0.993. The proportions of positive blocks were higher in the intraarticular (54%) and medial branch (55%) groups than in the placebo group (30%; P = 0.01). Radiofrequency ablation was performed on 135 patients (45, 48, and 42 patients from the intraarticular, medial branch, and saline groups, respectively). The average numerical rating scale pain score at 3 months was 3.0 ± 2.0 in the intraarticular, 3.2 ± 2.5 in the medial branch, and 3.5 ± 1.9 in the control group (P = 0.493). At 3 months, the proportions of positive responders in the intraarticular, medial branch block, and placebo groups were 51%, 56%, and 24% for the intraarticular, medial branch, and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.005). Conclusions This study establishes that facet blocks are not therapeutic. The higher responder rates in the treatment groups suggest a hypothesis that facet blocks might provide prognostic value before radiofrequency ablation.",0

Methods A total of 222 heart transplant recipients (mean [SD] age, 52.4 [10] years, 85% male) were evaluated. Patients with normal bone mineral density (reference group, n = 102) received 1000 mg/d calcium plus 800 IU/d vitamin D3. The rest were assigned to 200 IU/d of calcitonin (n = 42), 400 mg/d etidronate orally for 14 days quarterly (n = 33), or 10 mg/d alendronate (n = 45). All patients received calcium and vitamin D. Bone mineral density was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in the lumbar spine, the entire femur, and the femoral neck at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months after transplant. Results At 2 years after transplant, bone mineral density in the lumbar spine had decreased in the reference group (−3.07%), calcitonin group (−0.93%), and etidronate group (−1.87%) but not in the alendronate group (+4.9%; P &lt; .001). After 2 years, bone mineral density in the entire femur decreased in all groups (−3.2% in the reference group, −3.6% in the calcitonin group, −4.6% in the etidronate group, and −0.5% in the alendronate group) but bone loss was significantly lower in the alendronate group ( P &lt; .001). Bone mineral density in the femoral neck also decreased in all groups. The incidence of vertebral fractures did not differ among groups. Adverse events were similar between groups.

METHODS: Forty-five patients undergoing elective spinal surgery were randomly divided into three groups: group C, group D1 (Dex, 0.3 ?g kg(-1) h(-1)), and group D2 (Dex, 0.8 ?g kg(-1) h(-1)). Anesthesia administration: midazolam, propofol, fentanyl, and cisatracurium. Anesthesia maintenance: propofol and fentanyl. No muscle relaxant was used throughout the operation. When muscle relaxation was T 4/T 1 > 75%, SEPs and MEPs were monitored for the baseline. In group D1, Dex (0.3 ?g/kg, loading dose) was administered, followed by a 0.3 ?g kg(-1) h(-1) infusion of said drug until the end of surgery. In group D2, Dex (0.8 ?g/kg, loading dose) was injected, followed by a 0.8 ?g kg(-1) h(-1) infusion of said drug. RESULTS: Compared with group C, no significant difference was observed in the amplitude and latency of SEP (P15-N20) waves in groups D1 and D2 (P > 0.05). In groups C and D1, the MEP waveform did not disappear at every stage. In group D2, three patients lost the MEP waveform after the Dex loading dose, while four patients lost it during the Dex infusion stage. A significant difference was observed between groups C and D1. The median time to recover the MEP waveform was 47 min. CONCLUSIONS: Dex did not affect SEPs of senile patients, but inhibited MEPs when larger doses were administered.",0

In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, we compared the EVE technique with single-shot spinal anesthesia with respect to its sensory and motor block profile and hemodynamic stability. Sixty-two parturients (n = 31 in each group) undergoing elective cesarean deliveries were administered either spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine 9 mg and fentanyl 10 microg or CSE comprising intrathecal hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine 5 mg with fentanyl 10 microg, followed by 0.9% saline 6.0 mL through the epidural catheter 5 min thereafter. In each group, the lowest systolic blood pressure (SBP), sensory block level to loss of pain from pinprick, and modified Bromage scores were recorded at 2.5-min intervals. The visual analog pain score (VAS), peak sensory block height, highest modified Bromage motor score, time for sensory regression to the tenth thoracic dermatome (T10), and motor block recovery were compared between groups. Both groups were comparable in demographic data, VAS scores, peak sensory block height, time for sensory regression to T10, and lowest SBP recorded.

This study aimed to compare the hemodynamic changes caused by three different concentrations of epidural ropivacaine and to evaluate the performance of the stroke-volume variation (SVV) and central venous pressure (CVP) during TEA with general anesthesia.A total of 120 patients were administered 8 mL of ropivacaine solution via epidural injection, following randomization into one of three groups based on the concentration of ropivacaine in the study solution: 0.75%, 0.375%, or 0.2%. Hemodynamics were monitored for 30 min after loading. We analyzed the hemodynamic changes in the subgroups according to an age cutoff of 60 years. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to characterize the relationship of the SVV, CVP, and a 20% decrease in the mean arterial pressure (MAP) following TEA.Data from 109 patients were analyzed. MAP and systemic vascular resistance index were significantly decreased, and SVV was significantly increased after epidural loading only in the 0.75% ropivacaine group. There was a significant difference in hemodynamics between young and elderly subgroups in the 0.75% ropivacaine group. SVV showed a negative correlation with MAP, whereas CVP showed no correlation. The ROC analysis of SVV demonstrated a weak predictive ability of a 20% decrease in MAP at 10 min after the loading dose, with an area-under-the-curve of 0.687 and a 9.5% optimal cutoff value (sensitivity, 60.6%; specificity, 68.9%).A high concentration of ropivacaine through TEA caused a significant decrease in the systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. More significant decreases were shown in the elderly patients. Though the change of SVV showed a negative correlation with hypotension and indicated functional hypovolemia after TEA, the predictability was limited.Number: NCT01559285 , date: January 24, 2013.",0

All patients treated by laparoscopic resection from this collective were eligible for the present study. Primary endpoints were use of analgesics and visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores. Secondary endpoint concerned full gastrointestinal recovery, defined as the mean time to the occurrence of the following three events (GI-3): first flatus passed, first defecation, and first solid food tolerated.Results75 patients underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection, 39 in the TEA group and 36 in the non-TEA group. Patients with TEA required significantly less analgesics (metamizol median 3.0 g [0–32 g] versus 13.8 g [0–28 g] (p < 0.001); opioids mean 12 mg [±2.8 mg standard error of mean, SEM] versus 103 mg [±18.2 mg SEM] (p < 0.001).

BMD of the total body, femur neck and lumbar vertebra were significantly decreased below baseline at 2 months after transplantation in CONTR (-2.6 +/- 0.9%, -5.1 +/- 1.8%, -12.5 +/- 4.2%, respectively), ALEN (-2.8 +/- 0.8%, -5.3 +/- 1.6%, -12.0 +/- 3.9%) and ALEN + TRN groups (-2.7 +/- 1.0%, -5.6 +/- 2.1%, -11.2 +/- 3.7%). CONTR had further significant losses of BMD after 3 and 6 months. ALEN had no further regional BMD losses after initiation of alendronate therapy. ALEN + TRN restored BMD of the whole body, femur neck and lumbar vertebra to within 0.9%, 2.1%, and 3.4% of pre-transplantation levels, respectively.Resistance exercise plus alendronate was more efficacious than alendronate alone in restoring BMD in HTRs. Our results indicate that anti-osteoporosis therapy in this population should include both an anti-resorptive agent as well as an osteogenic stimulus, such as mechanical loading.",0

Treadmill exercise in a lower body negative pressure (LBNP) chamber provides axial loads on the lumbar spine. We hypothesize that daily supine LBNP exercise helps counteract lumbar spine deconditioning during 28 days of microgravity simulated by bed rest. Twelve sets of healthy, identical twins underwent 6 degrees head-down-tilt bed rest for 28 days. One subject from each set of twins was randomly assigned to the exercise (Ex) group, whereas their sibling served as a nonexercise control (Con). The Ex group exercised in supine posture within a LBNP chamber for 45 min/day, 6 days/wk. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging of their lumbar spine before and at the end of bed rest. Lumbar spinal length increased 3.7 +/- 0.5 mm in the Con group over 28-day bed rest, whereas, in the Ex group, lumbar spinal length increased significantly less (2.3 +/- 0.4 mm, P = 0.01). All lumbar intervertebral disk heights (L5-S1, L4-5, L3-4, L2-3, and L1-2) in the Con group increased significantly over the 28-day bed rest (P < 0.05). In the Ex group, there were no significant increases in L5-S1 and L4-5 disk heights. Lumbar lordosis decreased significantly by 3.3 +/- 1.2 degrees during bed rest in the Con group (P = 0.02), but it did not decrease significantly in the Ex group. Our results suggest that supine LBNP treadmill exercise partially counteracts lumbar spine lengthening and deconditioning associated with simulated microgravity.",0

Morbidity data are collected by on-site clinical personnel for 30 days postoperatively. Patients were divided into categories of ""never-smoker,"" for patients with no reported cigarette use (n = 27,246), ""former smoker,"" for patients who quit smoking more than 12 months before surgery (n = 562), and ""current smoker,"" for patients still using cigarettes (n = 7669). A univariate analysis was conducted to identify un-adjusted differences in morbidity risk, and a multivariate analysis was conducted in an attempt to control for confounders.In the multivariate analysis, current smokers had a significantly higher risk of both superficial surgical site infection and overall wound complications, than never-smokers (P < 0.05 for each). Current smokers also had a significantly higher risk of total 30-day morbidity (P = 0.04). There was a trend toward former smokers also having an increased risk, but this did not reach significance in any category. Patients with a pack-year smoking history of 1 to 20 pack-years and more than 40 pack-years both had a significantly higher risk of superficial surgical site infections (P < 0.05 for each).Current smoking is associated with a small but significant increase in systemic morbidity and wound complications following elective lumbar spine procedures. Increasing pack year history was also associated with wound complication risk, suggesting a dose-related effect. The data provide preliminary support for future studies on smoking cessation.3.",0

Zoledronic acid protects against bone mineral density loss when initiated concurrently with androgen deprivation therapy. We evaluated the effect of zoledronic acid initiated subsequent to androgen deprivation therapy on bone mineral density and biochemical markers of bone turnover.Patients with prostate cancer without bone metastases who had received androgen deprivation therapy for 12 months or less were randomized to 4 mg zoledronic acid or placebo intravenously every 3 months for 1 year. Patients were stratified according to androgen deprivation therapy duration (less than 6 vs 6 to 12 months). The primary end point was the change in femoral neck and lumbar spine bone mineral density in the 2 groups. The secondary end point was the change in serum bone specific alkaline phosphatase and urine N-telopeptide levels. Total hip bone mineral density was also measured.The 120 patients with prostate cancer received zoledronic acid (61) or placebo (59). Compared with placebo, zoledronic acid increased femoral neck, total hip and lumbar spine bone mineral density yearly by 3.6% (p = 0.0004), 3.8% (p <0.0001) and 6.7% (p <0.0001), respectively. The effects of zoledronic acid on bone mineral density at these 3 sites were not differentiated according to androgen deprivation therapy duration. Additionally, mean bone specific alkaline phosphatase and N-telopeptide levels were decreased in the zoledronic acid group (each p <0.0001) and were increased in the placebo group (p <0.0001 and p = 0.004, respectively).Zoledronic acid increased bone mineral density and suppressed bone turnover markers in patients with prostate cancer without bone metastases when initiated during year 1 of androgen deprivation therapy.",0

Between testing sessions 1 and 2, subjects received standardized functional prosthetic training. In Sessions 3-6, subjects tested four feet--solid ankle cushion heel, stationary attachment flexible endoskeleton, Talux (categories K1, K2, and K3, respectively), and Proprio-Foot (microprocessor ankle)--using a study socket and had a 10- to 14-day accommodation period with each foot.During ramp descent, K-Level-2 subjects demonstrated higher symmetry in external work values with Talux and Proprio-Foot compared to the solid ankle cushion heel foot. K-Level-3 subjects also had higher symmetry in external work values with the Talux foot than the solid ankle cushion heel foot. Ramp ascent symmetry in external work values were not significantly different between feet.Prosthetic foot category appears to influence symmetry in external work more during decline walking than incline walking. K-Level-2 unilateral transtibial amputees achieve greater symmetry from K3 dynamic response prosthetic feet with J-shaped ankle and microprocessor ankles while descending ramps.The findings suggest that K-Level-2 unilateral transtibial amputees benefit from K3 dynamic response prosthetic feet with J-shaped ankle. These results support the prescription of K3 feet for K-Level-2 amputees who frequently negotiate ramps.",0

Methods: Ten volunteers were enrolled in the study. We performed ultrasound-guided single-shot paravertebral blocks with 20 ml mepivacaine 1% at the thoracic six level at both sides on two consecutive days. After each paravertebral blockade, a magnetic resonance imaging investigation was performed to investigate the three-dimensional spread of the LA. In addition, sensory spread of blockade was evaluated via pinprick testing. Results: The median (interquartile range) cranial and caudal distribution of the LA relative to the thoracic six puncture level was 1.0 (2.5) and 3.0 (0.75) [=4.0 vertebral levels] for the left and 0.5 (1.0) and 3.0 (0.75) [=3.5 vertebral levels] for the right side. Accordingly, the LA distributed more caudally than cranially. The median (interquartile range) number of sensory dermatomes which were affected by the thoracic paravertebral blockade was 9.8 (6.5) for the left and 10.7 (8.8) for the right side. The sensory distribution of thoracic paravertebral blockade was significantly larger compared with the spread of LA. Conclusions: Although the spread of LA was reproducible, the anesthetic effect was unpredictable, even with a standardized ultrasound-guided technique in volunteers. While it can be assumed that approximately 4 vertebral levels are covered by 20 ml LA, the somatic distribution of the thoracic paravertebral blockade remains unpredictable. In a significant percentage, the LA distributes into the epidural space, prevertebral, or to the contralateral side.",0

In the present study, we investigated the postoperative analgesic effects between propofol-based TIVA and desflurane anesthesia after spine surgery. Methods Sixty patients were included who received (surgical time >180 minutes) lumbar spine surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either TIVA (with target-controlled infusion) with propofol/fentanyl-based anesthesia (TIVA group) or desflurane/fentanyl-based anesthesia (DES group), titrated to maintain Bispectral Index values between 45 and 55. All patients received patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with fentanyl for postoperative pain relief. Numeric pain rating scale (NRS) pain scores, postoperative fentanyl consumption, postoperative rescue tramadol use, and fentanyl-related side effects were recorded. Results The TIVA group patients reported lower NRS pain scores during coughing on postoperative day 1 but not day 2 and 3 (P = .002, P = .133, P = .161, respectively). Less fentanyl consumption was observed on postoperative days 1 and 2, but not on day 3 (375 μg vs 485 μg, P = .032, 414 μg vs 572 μg, P = .033, and 421 μg vs 479 μg, P = .209, respectively), less cumulative fentanyl consumption at postoperative 48 hours (790 μg vs 1057 μg, P = .004) and 72 hours (1210 μg vs 1536 μg, P = .004), and total fentanyl consumption (1393 μg vs 1704 μg, P = .007) when compared with the DES group. No difference was found in rescue tramadol use and fentanyl-related side effects. Conclusion Patients anesthetized with propofol-based TIVA reported less pain during coughing and consumed less daily and total PCA fentanyl after lumbar spine surgery.",0

Patients complain about vertigo, light muscle tenseness but also about severe joint blockages in the neck region. Due to this complication the standard practise in some hospitals is to refer these patients routinely to a physiotherapist postoperatively. This study investigated the influence of an axial traction - a treatment which can easily be learned by anaesthesiologists - on blockages of the cervical spine in those patients.In two randomised groups (n = 15 each) of preoperative inconspicuous patients the following directions of motion were investigated: Ante- and retroflexion of C0/1, side inclination C0/1, side nodding and side movement C2/3 to C6/T1, dorsal movement C5/Th2. The examinations took place at the preoperative anaesthetic round, shortly before extubation, two hours after extubation and the next day. Additionally the patients were asked about their discomfort. An axial traction of the cervical spine was performed in one group after extubation. The number of new blockages and the subjective discomfort of the patients was compared with the Chi-Square test.An axial traction of the cervical spine reduces the frequency and the intensity of symptoms significantly.It was investigated whether an axial traction of the cervical spine - a treatment that can easily be learned by anaesthesiologists - could improve patients' comfort. The study showed that an axial traction of the cervical spine immediately after extubation reduces the frequency and intensity of symptoms significantly. This treatment is highly effective, not very time consuming and, if done correctly, without any risk for the patient. By using this treatment routinely, additional expenses for physiotherapeutic interventions could be reduced.",0

BG and lactate were measured before and after cardiopulmonary bypass and postoperatively at least every 3 h together with administration of insulin. Postoperative pain was evaluated 30 min, 2, 4 and 6 h after extubation, and before discharge from the intensive care unit.Overall BG levels showed great variation over time (P < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was found in perioperative BG, but postoperative lower BG levels were found in HTEA patients (P = 0.042). The number of patients not receiving insulin in postoperative period was significantly higher in HTEA group (9 vs. 2, P = 0.032). No differences were seen in lactate levels. Patients in the HTEA group had significant lower pain scores (P < 0.001).HTEA preserves glucose metabolism better and leads to a lesser degree of 'stress hyperglycaemia' in cardiac surgery patients.",0

Using a 5-10 MHz linear ultrasound probe, the neuraxial structures were identified, the skin-epidural depth and epidural space was measured, the advancing epidural catheter visualized, and the spread of local anaesthetic verifying catheter position was confirmed. Epidural placement procedures were analysed for bone contacts and speed of execution. Children under 6 months were analysed separately.Epidural placement involved bone contacts in 17% of children in the ultrasound group and 71% of children in the LOR group (P<0.0001). Epidurals were executed more swiftly in the ultrasound group [162 (75) s vs 234 (138) s; P<0.01]. Children under 6 months revealed a 0.9 correlation between skin-epidural depth and body weight.Ultrasonography is a useful aid to verify epidural placement of local anaesthetic agents and epidural catheters in children. Advantages include a reduction in bone contacts, faster epidural placement, direct visualization of neuraxial structures and the spread of local anaesthetic inside the epidural space. Ultrasound guidance requires additional training and good manual skills, and should only be used once experience in ultrasound-guided techniques of regional anaesthesia has been acquired.",0

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize literature from 1980 through 2006 on noninvasive interventions for neck pain and its associated disorders. No comprehensive systematic literature reviews have been published on interventions for neck pain and its associated disorders in the past decade. We systematically searched Medline and screened for relevance literature published from 1980 through 2006 on the use, effectiveness, and safety of noninvasive interventions for neck pain and associated disorders. Consensus decisions were made about the scientific merit of each article; those judged to have adequate internal validity were included in our best evidence synthesis. Of the 359 invasive and noninvasive intervention articles deemed relevant, 170 (47%) were accepted as scientifically admissible, and 139 of these related to noninvasive interventions (including health care utilization, costs, and safety). For whiplash-associated disorders, there is evidence that educational videos, mobilization, and exercises appear more beneficial than usual care or physical modalities. For other neck pain, the evidence suggests that manual and supervised exercise interventions, low-level laser therapy, and perhaps acupuncture are more effective than no treatment, sham, or alternative interventions; however, none of the active treatments was clearly superior to any other in either the short-or long-term. For both whiplash-associated disorders and other neck pain without radicular symptoms, interventions that focused on regaining function as soon as possible are relatively more effective than interventions that do not have such a focus. Our best evidence synthesis suggests that therapies involving manual therapy and exercise are more effective than alternative strategies for patients with neck pain; this was also true of therapies which include educational interventions addressing self-efficacy. Future efforts should focus on the study of noninvasive interventions for patients with radicular symptoms and on the design and evaluation of neck pain prevention strategies.",0

In this study, we compared the use of ultrasound to the landmark method in patients with no anticipated technical difficulty, presenting for caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia.A total of 150 pregnant women were recruited in this randomized, controlled study. Ultrasound examination and spinal anaesthesia were performed by three anaesthetists with experience in ultrasound-guided neuraxial block. Patients were randomized to either the Ultrasound Group (n=75) or the Landmark Group (n=75). In both groups the level of L3-4 or L4-5 was identified by ultrasound (transverse and longitudinal approach) or palpation. The primary outcome was the procedure time, measured from the time of skin puncture by the introducer to the time of viewing cerebrospinal fluid at the hub of the spinal needle. Secondary outcomes were the number of skin punctures, number of passes, and incidence of successful spinal blockade.The average procedure time, number of skin punctures and needle passes, were similar in both groups. The number of patients with successful spinal anaesthesia after one puncture was not statistically different between the groups.The present results indicate that when performed by anaesthetists experienced in both ultrasound and landmark techniques, the use of ultrasound does not appear to increase the success rate of spinal anaesthesia, or reduce the procedure time or number of attempts in obstetric patients with easily palpable spines.",0

Chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine are the most preferred compounds among antiseptics. Both are proved to be safe and effective for skin disinfection. In this study, our aim was to investigate the combined effects of chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine on the skin's flora before neurosurgical intervention, consecutively.Randomly, 50 cranial and 50 spine neurosurgery cases were assigned to the study. The first culture was obtained after hair removal and before cleaning the skin with any antiseptic. The second culture was obtained after the skin had been cleaned with chlorhexidine for 3 minutes. Then, the skin was cleaned twice with povidone-iodine for 30 seconds, and the third and fourth cultures were taken from the skin incision area. Bacteria were identified by means of standard laboratory identification methods. Positive culture results were compared statistically among order of cultures obtained.In the first culture evaluation, 39 (33 cnS, 6 Stapylococcus aureus) of 50 cranial samples and 37 (33 cnS, 4 S aureus) of 50 spine samples showed reproduction. In the second culture, 9 cranial and 5 spine samples showed reproduction of cnS. In the third and fourth cultures, no growth was observed (P < .001).Three minutes' cleaning of the incision area with chlorhexidine, followed by 30-second cleaning with povidone-iodine, could be a sufficient disinfection procedure for preoperative preparation of the skin in patients undergoing a neurosurgical procedure.",0

Group A was given oral amantadine 50 or 100 mg 1 hour before surgery and 8, 20, 32 hours after operation. Group P received placebo at identical times. Pain was assessed using numerical rating scale before first administration of morphine and in 2, 3, 4, 6, 24, and 48 hours after operation. The amounts of morphine consumed were recorded up to 48 hours after surgery. Blood samples were taken twice in 2 hours after surgery and plasma levels of morphine and its main metabolites were measured.As compared with placebo, amantadine significantly reduced intra-operative Fentanyl use and sensation of postoperative pain. Up to 48 hours after operation, the cumulative consumption of morphine was 25% lower in the amantadine group. Moreover, intensity of nausea and vomiting tended to be lower in A group. Starting from 12th hour after surgery, the level of postoperative sedation was lower in patients who received amantadine, as compared with placebo group. No significant differences in plasma levels of morphine ant its metabolites were observed between A and P groups.Pre- and postoperative administration of amantadine significantly reduced fentanyl use during operation, as well as reduced the postoperative pain and decreased morphine consumption in young patients undergoing orthopedic surgery.",0

A cross-sectional study of candidates for lumbar disc prosthesis,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether combined magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are related to the degree of disability and low back pain (LBP) in candidates for lumbar disc prosthesis surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 170 disc prosthesis candidates (mean age 41 years; 88 women) with chronic non-radicular LBP and localized disc degeneration. Experienced radiologists rated Modic changes and disc findings at L4-S1 on pre-treatment MRIs. An MRI total score (0-10) for findings at L4/L5 plus L5/S1 was calculated for Modic type I and/or II changes, a posterior high intensity zone (HIZ) in the disc, dark/black nucleus pulposus signal, and ?40 % disc height decrease. We analyzed the relationship of the MRI total score to the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (n = 170) and LBP intensity scores (0-100 visual analogue scale, n = 165) using multiple linear regression and adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, smoking, and anxiety/depression. RESULTS: The MRI total score was not related to ODI (regression coefficient 0.12, p = 0.79) or LBP intensity (regression coefficient 0.64, p = 0.37). When individual MRI findings were analyzed, patients with HIZ at L5/S1 had slightly lower ODI scores (4.7 points, p = 0.02). In post hoc analyses, results remained unchanged after adding facet arthropathy to the MRI total score and adjusting also for physical workload and physical leisure-time activity. CONCLUSIONS: The combined MRI findings were not related to the degree of disability or the intensity of LBP. These degenerative MRI findings cannot explain variation in pre-treatment disability and pain in patients with chronic LBP accepted for disc prosthesis surgery.",0

The diagnosis of cervical facet joint pain is usually made with diagnostic blocks of the nerves that innervate them. Yet, medial branch blocks are associated with a high false-positive rate. One hypothesized cause of inaccurate diagnostic blocks is inadvertent extravasation of injectate into adjacent pain-generating structures. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of medial branch blocks by using different injectate volumes. Methods Twenty-four patients received cervical medial branch blocks, using either 0.5 or 0.25 ml of bupivacaine mixed with contrast. One half of the patients in each group were suballocated to receive the blocks in the prone position and the other half through a lateral approach. Participants then underwent computed tomography of the cervical spine to evaluate accuracy and patterns of aberrant contrast spread. Results Sixteen instances of aberrant spread were observed in nine patients receiving blocks using 0.5 ml versus seven occurrences in six patients in the 0.25 ml group (P = 0.07). Aberrant spread was most commonly observed (57%) when an injection at C3 engulfed the third occipital nerve. Among the 86 nerve blocks, foraminal spread occurred in five instances using 0.5 ml and in two cases with 0.25 ml. The six ""missed"" nerves were equally divided between treatment groups. No significant difference in any outcome measure was observed between the prone and lateral positions.

We evaluated BMD after OAGB as a function of vitamin D supplementation with respect to a minimum threshold of 25-hydroxy-vitamin-D [25(OH)D] concentration, which could prevent or decelerate an eventual bone loss.Fifty bariatric patients who participated in the randomized controlled trial were included in this analysis. BMD and anthropometric measurements by DXA and laboratory parameters were assessed before (T0), at 6 (T6), and 12 months (T12) after surgery.OAGB resulted in a 36% total body weight loss with a decrease in body fat and an increase in lean body mass. A significant decrease in BMD was seen in lumbar spine by 7%, left hip 13%, and total body 1%, but not in forearm. Bone turnover markers increased significantly but with normal parathyroid hormone concentrations. Weight loss was not associated with changes in BMD. A serum 25(OH)D concentration > 50 nmol/l at T6 and T12 (adequate-vitamin-D-group; AVD) showed a significant lower bone loss, compared to the inadequate-vitamin-D-group (IVD; < 50 nmol/l). Lower bone loss in the left hip showed a strong correlation with higher 25(OH)D concentrations (r = 0.635, p = 0.003).These findings support a dose effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone health and suggest that 25(OH)D concentrations need to be above 50 nmol/l at least during the first postoperative year to decelerate bone loss in patients undergoing OAGB.Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02092376) at https://clinicaltrials.gov /.

Continuous epidural analgesia through two epidural catheters was shown to be effective after posterior scoliosis correction. The efficacy of this technique has still not been demonstrated in this surgical context.Thirty adolescent patients with thoracic idiopathic scoliosis scheduled for anterior correction were prospectively randomized into morphine (M) or epidural (E) group. In the E group, two epidural catheters were placed transforaminally after scoliosis correction. The immediate postoperative analgesia was performed with remifentanil in all patients until the first postoperative morning (T0 = begin of study), when either continuous intravenous morphine (M group) or continuous epidural ropivacaine 0.3% (E group) was initiated. Pain at rest and in motion, morphine consumption, sensory level, motor blockade, nausea/vomiting, pruritus, bowel function, and patient satisfaction were assessed.In the E group, there was significantly less pain at rest and in motion, less rescue morphine consumption, improved bowel activity, and higher patient satisfaction. The incidence of side effects was significantly higher in M group.Two epidural catheters provide better postoperative analgesia with fewer side effects and higher patient satisfaction after anterior instrumentation of thoracic scoliosis.",0

Alendronate was initiated at 7 days after Tx. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry before and 2 and 8 months after Tx. Resistance training was initiated at 2 months after Tx and consisted of lumbar extension exercise performed 1 day/week for 6 months. <h3>Results</h3> Lumbar BMD decreased significantly to below pre-transplant baseline at 2 months after Tx in controls (−12.5 ± 2.1%), but not in the alendronate (1.5 ± 1.2%) or alendronate + training (1.5 ± 0.9%) groups. At 8 months after Tx, lumbar BMD in controls was 14.1 ± 3.9% below baseline (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05), but was 1.4 ± 1.1% above baseline in alendronate recipients (<i>p</i> ≥ 0.05). The alendronate + training group showed a significantly increased lumbar BMD with values 10.8 ± 2.3% greater than before Tx. <h3>Conclusions</h3> These results suggest that resistance exercise plus alendronate is more effective than alendronate alone in restoring BMD. Anti-osteoporosis therapy in LTRs should include both an anti-resorptive agent and an osteogenic stimulus, such as mechanical loading.",0

There is considerable evidence that bisphosphonates are effective in decreasing osteoporosis. This prospective study was carried out to see the effects of bisphosphonates on bone mineral density (BMD) after successful renal transplantation. Fifty consecutive patients of successful renal transplantation were randomized into two groups. Group A ( n = 27) received 35 mg/wk of Alendronate for 6 months after transplantation. Group B ( n = 23) did not receive Alendronate and served as a control. Both groups underwent a pretransplant baseline dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan of their hips and lumber spines. Both groups received oral calcium and vitamin D supplement. Both groups were matched for the regimen and dose of immunosuppressive drugs. BMD was measured at 3 months and 6 months after transplantation. Both groups showed a decline in BMD in early months posttransplantation. However, the 6-month DEXA scans showed a significant rise in BMD in group A as compared to group B. Bisphosphonates appear to have a beneficial effect on steroid-induced bone loss.",0

To compare two prophylactic medical regimens after heart transplantation, 26 consecutive heart transplant recipients were randomized to receive either continuous oral calcitriol (0.5 microg/day) combined with nasal salmon calcitonin (200 U/day) for the first 3 months (group A) or intermittent intravenous pamidronate (0.5 mg/kg body weight) every third month (group B). Bone mineral density (BMD) and biochemical indices of bone turnover were measured at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after transplantation. The mean pretransplant BMD, measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was significantly lower in the patients compared with age-matched healthy controls. During the first year of treatment, rates of bone loss at the lumbar spine and femoral neck were slightly but significantly slower in the patients treated with pamidronate, but there was no longer a significant difference between the two groups after 18 months of heart transplantation. Irrespective of the mode of osteoporosis prevention, osteocalcin levels increased whereas urinary deoxypyridinoline decreased after transplantation, and significant bone loss was observed in both treatment groups. We found no relationship between initial BMD, markers of bone turnover, cumulative glucocorticoid dose, or cyclosporine levels and the rate of bone loss after cardiac transplantation. In summary, we found that the rapid and severe bone loss following heart transplantation could be attenuated by two preventive measures, pamidronate or calcitriol with calcitonin.",0

We randomly allocated 50 patients scheduled for surgery after lower limb injuries for placement of a lumbar epidural catheter in the sitting position with the back in the neutral unflexed position by either the midline or paramedian approach. If the approach failed after two attempts, patients were placed in a flexed-spine position, and the procedure was attempted again. Technical difficulties and complications were recorded. In 17 patients in the midline group, and 1 patient in the paramedian group, it was not possible to insert the needle initially, and a flexed-spine position was required (P < 0.05). The incidences of resistance to catheter insertion (eight versus one), paresthesia (seven versus zero), and appearance of blood in the catheter (six versus zero) were significantly more frequent in the midline compared with the paramedian approach. The midline group also experienced more discomfort than the paramedian group. We conclude that, with the patient sitting with an unflexed spine, it is usually possible to insert an epidural catheter with the paramedian approach.",0

There are no prospective randomised studies comparing the use of PVB versus caudal block (CB) for outpatient inguinal hernia repair surgery. The hypothesis of this study is that a single level, single injection PVB can provide a longer duration of analgesia and less requirement for supplemental analgesia than single shot CB for children undergoing inguinal surgery. Seventy children, aged three to seven, American Society of Anesthesiologists score I to II, having unilateral inguinal surgery were enrolled in the study. The patients were divided into two randomised groups. In group PVB, a single shot of 0.2 ml/kg levobupivacaine was administered via the lumbar paravertebral route and in group CB, patients were given 1 ml/kg levobupivacaine caudally. Sevoflurane concentration was evaluated after induction and recorded during incision, sac traction and closure. Face, legs, activity, cry and consolability (FLACC) scores, heart rate, blood pressure and SpO 2 were evaluated postoperatively. Only four (11.4 %) patients in the PVB group needed rescue analgesic drugs compared to 12 (34.3%) patients in the CB group (P=0.044). Patients were given tramadol as rescue analgesia in the first four postoperative hours. No other supplemental analgesic drug was given apart from tramadol. FLACC scores were the same in the both groups. Parental satisfaction was significantly higher in the PVB group compared to the CB group (74.3 vs 40%, P=0.01). This study has demonstrated that a single level single injection paravertebral block provides superior intraoperative and postoperative analgesia when compared to a caudal block for unilateral inguinal hernia repair.",0

In the 0.45% saline group, seven patients (18%) became hyponatraemic (Na <135 mmol/l) at 16-18 h postoperatively; in the Hartmann's group no patient became hyponatraemic (p=0.01). No child in either fluid group became hypernatraemic.The postoperative fall in plasma sodium was smaller in children who received Hartmann's and 5% dextrose compared to those who received 0.45% saline and 5% dextrose.

Tramadol has been shown to have effects similar to those of local anesthetics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of wound infiltration with levobupivacaine and tramadol on postoperative analgesia for lumbar discectomies.Eighty adult patients who were scheduled to undergo elective lumbar discectomy operations were included in the study. Patients were randomly allocated to 4 groups: wound infiltration with 100 mg levobupivacaine (group L), 2 mg/kg tramadol (group T), 2 mg/kg tramadol plus 100 mg levobupivacaine (group LT), and saline (group C). Pain scores with the visual analog scale, patient-controlled analgesic consumption (pethidine), time to first analgesic treatment, and side effects were assessed during the postoperative period.The time to first analgesia was earliest in group C (11.3±2.2 min), followed by group L (163.0±216.3 min) and group T (803.2±268.4 min) (P<0.001). None of the patients in group LT required postoperative analgesic supplementation, and the visual analog scale scores were <3 at all measurement times (P<0.05). Postoperative opioid consumption was 196.0±71.6 mg in group C, 129.0±78.3 mg in group L, and 37.0±35.4 mg in group T (P<0.001). The incidence of side effects was lower in group LT than in the other groups.Wound infiltration with combined levobupivacaine and tramadol resulted in elimination of postoperative analgesic demand and reduction in the incidence of side effects. We conclude that infiltration of the wound site with combined levobupivacaine and tramadol provides significantly better analgesia compared with levobupivacaine or tramadol alone.",0

In an earlier study we found that the injection of 5 mg/kg of lidocaine via the paravertebral route depressed myocardial contractility by up to 30%, with practically no changes in heart rate or blood pressure. In the present study we investigated whether these alterations are due to systemic absorption of the local anesthetic, and whether such absorption can be minimized by adding epinephrine to the local anesthetic solution.A prospective, blind, and randomized study was made of 50 patients subjected to lung resection surgery. The subjects were divided into two groups: Lid group (5 mg/kg bolus dose of lidocaine in the thoracic paravertebral space) and Lid+E group (addition of 5 mcg/mL of epinephrine to the local anesthetic). The anesthetic solution was administered through a paravertebral catheter ipsilateral to the operative side. In addition to routine hemodynamic monitoring (heart rate and radial artery blood pressure), an aortic transpulmonary thermodilution catheter was inserted into the femoral artery for recording of the following variables: cardiac index, cardiac function index, maximum pressure derivative, global end diastolic volume, and intrathoracic total blood volume index. Data collection was carried out immediately before administration of the anesthetic solution and 15, 30, and 45 minutes after administration. Measurements were made of the plasma lidocaine levels at those same postparavertebral injection time points.Prior to paravertebral dosing there were no differences in terms of the hemodynamic variables studied. However, 15 minutes after dosing in the Lid+E group, lesser reductions in contractility, cardiac function index, and cardiac index were recorded, compared with the Lid group, with a significant reduction in cardiac filling volumes. Blood lidocaine levels were 53% and 34% lower in Lid+E group, as recorded 15 and 30 minutes after injection. The patients who, 15 minutes after paravertebral injection, had blood lidocaine levels greater than 3 mcg/mL (independently of the type of anesthetic solution used) had a significant reduction in mean blood pressure, cardiac function index, cardiac index, and maximum pressure derivative, compared with the patients with lower blood lidocaine concentrations.Addition of epinephrine to lidocaine when performing thoracic paravertebral block, attenuates the cardiodepressive effects associated with the systemic absorption of lidocaine and also, as a result of the beta-adrenergic consequences of epinephrine, systemic absorption from the paravertebral space.",0

The purpose of this study was to report a hip screening examination of asymptomatic female soccer athletes and to test the hypothesis that these findings vary by competition experience.MethodsAsymptomatic females from a youth soccer club, a college, and a professional team were evaluated. Passive hip range of motion, hip abduction strength, and hip provocative tests were assessed. Data were compared for the grade/middle school, high school, college, and professional athletes.ResultsOne hundred and seventy-two athletes with a mean age of 16.7 ± 5 years (range 10–30) participated. Professional athletes had less flexion (HF) for both hips (p < 0.0001) and less internal rotation (IR) for the preferred kicking leg (p < 0.05) compared to all other groups.

Our team has proposed a modified approach that improves the osteotomy site and its fixation procedure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of traditional and modified lamina replantation methods in treating unstable lumbar disc herniation.From March 2008 to August 2011, 124 patients with unstable lumbar disc herniation were enrolled and randomly divided into the following two groups according to random digital table: group A (traditional group) consisting of 61 patients who underwent traditional laminectomy replantation, and group B (modified group) consisting of 63 patients who underwent modified lamina replantation. Both surgeries were performed by the same surgeons. The two groups had no significant difference in gender, age, symptoms, time of onset and the prominent segment. Visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswertry disability index (ODI), and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores, operative time, blood loss, complication rate, radiographic healing rates, and low back pain recurrence rates were compared between the two groups.There were 121 patients followed up for more than one year, and the follow-up rate was 97.6%. Nerve injury occurred in two patients (3.3%) in the modified group and 12 patients (20.0%) in the traditional group. Dural injury occurred in one patient (1.6%) in the modified group and seven patients (11.7%) in the traditional group. Pseudarthrosis occurred in two patients in the modified group and in 18 patients in the traditional group with 1-year fusion rates of 96.7% and 70.0%, respectively. Recurrence of lower back pain after one year was noted in three patients (4.9%) in the modified group, and in 15 (25.0%) in the traditional group. Leg pain recurrence was noted in one patient (1.6%) in the modified group and in three cases (5.0%) in the traditional group. The one-year healing rates of nerve injury, dural injury, replantation lamina and low back pain recurrence rates after one year were significantly different (P < 0.05) between the two groups. At two weeks, three months, six months and one year postoperatively, both groups had significant improvement in VAS, ODI, and JOA scores from their preoperative values (P < 0.05). No significant difference was detected between the short term postoperative scores between groups A and B (P > 0.05). However, a significant difference was found one year later (P < 0.05).Compared to the traditional approach, the modified technique for lamina replantation showed lower rates of dural and nerve damage, a higher lamina healing rate, a lower back pain recurrence rate, and better clinical scores. It is a safe and effective operation for lumbar spine surgery.",0

We obtained iliac crest biopsies from postmenopausal osteoporotic women given placebo (n=8) or 100 microg PTH(1-84) for 18 (n=8) or 24 (n=7) months to assess cancellous and cortical bone formation and structure. At 18 months, cancellous bone volume (BV/TV) measured by microcomputed tomography and histomorphometry was 45-48% higher in subjects treated with PTH(1-84) versus placebo, a result of higher trabecular number (Tb.N) and thickness. The higher Tb.N appeared to result from intratrabecular tunneling. Connectivity density was higher and structure model index was lower, indicating a better connected and more plate-like trabecular architecture. Cancellous bone formation rate (BFR) was 2-fold higher in PTH(1-84)-treated subjects, primarily because of greater mineralizing surface. Osteoblast and osteoid surfaces were a nonsignificant 58% and 35%, respectively, higher with PTH(1-84) treatment. Osteoclast and eroded surface were unaffected by PTH(1-84). There were no effects of PTH(1-84) treatment on cortical thickness, or endocortical or periosteal BFR, but cortical porosity tended to be higher. Although cancellous BFR was lower at 24 than at 18 months, measures of cancellous and cortical bone structure were similar at both timepoints. The bone produced by PTH(1-84) had normal lamellar structure and mineralization with no abnormal histology. In conclusion, when compared with placebo, treatment of osteoporotic women with PTH(1-84) was associated with higher BV/TV and trabecular connectivity, with a more plate-like architecture, all consistent with the lower vertebral fracture incidence.",0

Several studies have evaluated changes in cardiac function after prone positioning, and linked them to reduced venous return and ventricular compliance. This study compares different prone positioners using transesophageal echocardiography, and determines their effect on cardiac function and hemodynamics.After correction of fluid deficits with the patient under stable anesthesia, hemodynamic and cardiac performance was measured using transesophageal echocardiography. After prone positioning, repeat measurements were performed, and comparisons were made between prone and supine positions.No intergroup differences in demographics, fluid deficit, baseline hemodynamics, or differences from supine to prone position were noted. Cardiac output decreased with the Wilson (Union City, CA) and Siemens AG (Munich, Germany) frames, while cardiac index and stroke volume decreased with the Andrews (Hollywood, CA), Wilson, and Siemens systems. Cardiac preload decreased using the Andrews frame. The Jackson spine table (Hollywood, CA) and bolsters had the least effect on cardiac performance.Adequate fluid replacement reduced hypotension and hemodynamic instability after prone positioning. The Jackson spine table and longitudinal bolsters had minimal effects on cardiac function, and should be considered in patients with limited cardiac reserve.",0

The calculation of absolute risk of major fracture and hip fracture was by FRAX® website. This work follows the guidelines of the STROBE initiative for cohort studies. The discriminative capacity of FRAX® was analyzed by the Area Under Curve (AUC), Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. The predictive capacity was determined using the ratio of observed fractures/expected fractures by FRAX® (ObsFx/ExpFx).The study subjects were 770 women from 40 to 90 years of age in the FRIDEX cohort. The mean age was 56.8 ± 8 years. The fractures were determined by structured telephone questionnaire and subsequent testing in medical records at 10 years. Sixty-five (8.4%) women presented major fractures (17 hip fractures). Women with fractures were older, had more previous fractures, more cases of rheumatoid arthritis and also more osteoporosis on the baseline DXA. The AUC ROC of FRAX® for major fracture without bone mineral density (BMD) was 0.693 (CI 95%; 0.622-0.763), with T-score of femoral neck (FN) 0.716 (CI 95%; 0.646-0.786), being 0.888 (CI 95%; 0.824-0.952) and 0.849 (CI 95%; 0.737-0.962), respectively for hip fracture. In the model with BMD alone was 0.661 (CI 95%; 0.583-0.739) and 0.779 (CI 95%; 0.631-0.929). In the model with age alone was 0.668 (CI 95%; 0.603-0.733) and 0.882 (CI 95%; 0.832-0.936). In both cases there are not significant differences against FRAX® model. The overall predictive value for major fracture by ObsFx/ExpFx ratio was 2.4 and 2.8 for hip fracture without BMD. With BMD was 2.2 and 2.3 respectively. Sensitivity of the four was always less than 50%. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed a good correlation only after calibration with ObsFx/ExpFx ratio.The current version of FRAX® for Spanish women without BMD analysed by the AUC ROC demonstrate a poor discriminative capacity to predict major fractures but a good discriminative capacity for hip fractures. Its predictive capacity does not adjust well because leading to underdiagnosis for both predictions major and hip fractures. Simple models based only on age or BMD alone similarly predicted that more complex FRAX® models.",0

The primary outcome was the view obtained at laryngoscopy. Secondary outcomes included time to tracheal intubation, rates of successful intubation and incidence of complications. In all patients, the view was better (92%) or the same (8%) in the McGrath group versus the Macintosh group (p < 0.01). There were no failed intubations in the McGrath group and seven (28%) in the Macintosh group (p < 0.02). There was no statistical difference in time taken to intubate or incidence of complications. We conclude that the McGrath® Series 5 is a superior laryngoscope when cervical spine immobilisation is maintained during tracheal intubation.",0

A total of 66 patients undergoing lumbar laminectomy were included in the present study of whom 64 completed the study. Patients were randomly divided into three groups: (i) spinal anesthesia - the SA group; (ii) epidural anesthesia - the EA group; and (iii) combined spinal-epidural anesthesia - the CA group. Demographical data, surgical times and peak sensory levels of groups were similar. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and peripheral oxygen saturation did not differ between the three groups. No differences were observed intraoperatively in Ramsey sedation scale (RSS) scores between the groups, but postoperatively, although RSS scores were similar for the EA and CA groups, they were significantly lower for the SA group. The postoperative visual analogue scale pain scores were higher in the SA group compared to the EA and the CA groups except for the second postoperative hour. Time-to-use of the first patient controlled analgesia was similar for all groups. The total consumption of morphine over the 24-hour study period was significantly higher in the SA group compared to the EA and the CA groups. Postoperative nausea and vomiting frequencies were higher in SA group, but pruritus frequency was lower than the EA and the CA groups. In conclusion, although spinal, epidural, and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia are adequate and effective for lumbar laminectomies, epidural and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia techniques are more effective than spinal anesthesia for postoperative analgesia and sedation with lesser side effects.",0

We compared the effect of propofol or sevoflurane anaesthesia on the incidence and severity of coughing during recovery in patients undergoing cervical spine surgery via an anterior approach. As a secondary aim, we also evaluated the influences of smoking and estimated residual anaesthetic agent concentrations on coughing.Thirty-four patients were enrolled in a randomized prospective, double-blind study to receive either propofol (PPF) or sevoflurane (SEVO) for maintenance of anaesthesia. The decision to perform tracheal extubation was based on specified criteria, including resumption of spontaneous respiration and consciousness. During emergence from anaesthesia and extubation, coughing was observed and graded at predefined times.The incidence of severe coughing was higher in the SEVO group than in the PPF group (59% and 6%, respectively), and also in smokers than in non-smokers (50% and 17%, respectively). The peak incidence of coughing was at tracheal extubation. The probability of coughing was influenced by the estimated residual concentration of anaesthetic agents at extubation, except for smokers in the SEVO group who were at the highest risk of coughing.The incidence of coughing after cervical spine surgery when tracheal extubation is performed according to clinical criteria is lower after propofol anaesthesia compared with sevoflurane anaesthesia. Smokers are at increased risk of coughing, independently of the type of anaesthesia maintenance. Higher residual concentrations of anaesthetic agents decrease the probability of coughing, except for smokers anaesthetized with sevoflurane.",0

Inclusions from April 2007 to February 2010.153 adult patients scheduled for pulmonary surgery.All three groups received systemic analgesia with paracetamol and morphine (patient-controlled analgesia, PCA). The PCA group received systemic analgesia only. The TPVB group underwent insertion of a paravertebral catheter and the CWC group underwent CWC catheter insertion at the end of the intervention.Pain score at rest as assessed by VAS.One hundred and fifty-three patients were included, of whom 140 were included in the final analysis (50 PCA, 44 TPVB, 46 CWC). Baseline and surgical characteristics were comparable in the three groups. VAS scores were statistically different between the TPVB and PCA groups at rest (at 0, 1, 3, 6 h; P < 0.0026) and after coughing (0, 1, 3, 6, 12 h; P < 0.003). In recovery room care, titrated morphine doses were significantly lower (P = 0.00001) in the TPVB group than in the other two. Morphine consumption was statistically lower in the TPVB group than in the PCA group at 24 h (P = 0.0036). There was no difference between CWC and PCA groups in terms of VAS scores or morphine consumption. No signs of toxicity or local complications were observed.Our results support the efficacy of TPVB for pain management after thoracotomy, at rest and after coughing. These results confirm the preference for TPVB over epidural analgesia in postthoracotomy pain care. CWC failed to decrease pain and morphine consumption and performed no better than placebo.",0

The concentration resulting in 50% inhibition (IC<sub>50,</sub> 2 µM) was &gt;35x higher than the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after oral administration of the approved dose of ivermectin when given fasted. <h3>Method</h3> Simulations were conducted using an available population pharmacokinetic model to predict total (bound and unbound) and unbound plasma concentration-time profiles after a single and repeat fasted administration of the approved dose of ivermectin (200 μg/kg), 60 mg, and 120 mg. Plasma total Cmax was determined and then multiplied by the lung:plasma ratio reported in cattle to predict the lung Cmax after administration of each single dose. <h3>Results</h3> Plasma ivermectin concentrations of total (bound and unbound) and unbound concentrations do not reach the IC<sub>50</sub>, even for a dose level 10x higher than the approved dose. Even with higher exposure in lungs than plasma, ivermectin is unlikely to reach the IC<sub>50</sub> in lungs after single oral administration of the approved dose (predicted lung: 0.0857 µM) or at doses 10x higher that the approved dose administered orally (predicted lung: 0.817 µM). <h3>Conclusions</h3> The likelihood of a successful clinical trial using the approved dose of ivermectin is low. Combination therapy should be evaluated <i>in vitro</i>. Re-purposing drugs for use in COVID-19 treatment is an ideal strategy but is only feasible when product safety has been established and experiments of re-purposed drugs are conducted at clinically relevant concentrations.",0

In the clinical field, it is well known that pregabalin, which binds to the voltage-gated calcium channel alpha-2-delta-1 (α2δ-1) subunit has therapeutic effects on NeuP after SCI. A previous study has demonstrated that SCI increased α2δ-1 in the L4-L6 dorsal spinal cord of SCI rats by Western blot analysis and that the increase of α2δ-1 was correlated with tactile allodynia of the hind paw. However, the detailed feature of an increase in α2δ-1 protein in the spinal dorsal horn and the mechanism of pregabalin effect on SCI-induced NeuP have not been fully examined.This study aimed to examine the detailed distribution of α2δ-1 expression in the lumbar spinal cord after thoracic SCI in rats and the correlation of the therapeutic effect of pregabalin in SCI rats.Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent thoracic (T10) spinal cord contusion injury using the IH impactor device. Spinal cord injury rats received pregabalin (30 mg/kg) once a day for 2 weeks over a 4-week period after SCI.The mechanical threshold in the rat hind paw was measured over 4 weeks. Alpha-2-delta-1 expression in the lumbar spinal cord and in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization histochemistry.A significant reduction of the withdrawal threshold of mechanical stimuli to the hind paw was observed for 2 weeks and continued at least 4 weeks after SCI. In the control rats, expression of α2δ-1 immunoreactivity was detected mainly in laminae I and II in the lumbar dorsal horn. Thoracic SCI significantly increased α2δ-1 immunoreactivity in laminae I and II in the lumbar dorsal horn 4 weeks after SCI; however, thoracic SCI did not affect the expression of α2δ-1 mRNA in the L4 and L5 DRGs. Meanwhile, the signal intensity of α2δ-1 mRNAs in the lumbar spinal cord increased from Day 7 and continued for at least 28 days after SCI. Cellular analysis showed that SCI increased the number of α2δ-1-expressing cells in laminae I and II. The tactile allodynia of the hind paw in the SCI rats was reversed after pregabalin treatment and was maintained for 21 days. This administration of pregabalin decreased the α2δ-1 immunoreactivity significantly in the lumbar dorsal horn of thoracic SCI rats at 28 days after SCI.The present study results suggest that an increase of α2δ-1 in the L4 and L5 dorsal horns after thoracic SCI is derived from the increase in the expression in lumbar spinal neurons. This increase may be involved in the development of NeuP in the hind paws and the therapeutic effect of pregabalin on central NeuP after SCI.",0

Manual-in-line stabilization was applied and the best laryngoscopic view obtained. For the CMS, the primed tracheal tube was advanced under direct vision if Cormack-Lehane grade 1/2, placed behind the epiglottis and advanced blindly if grade 3, and intubation was not attempted if grade 4. For the FOS, the primed tracheal tube was advanced under the direct vision if grade 1/2 and under fibreoptic vision if grade 3/4.Intubation was successful more frequently (P = 0.02) and required fewer attempts (P = 0.003) with the FOS than the CMS.

However, more qualitative data of the kinematics of the cervical spine are needed for the development and success of cervical disc arthroplasty.The aim of this study was to provide basic information about helical axes of human cervical spine under in vitro conditions. Furthermore, it should clarify whether the three-dimensional helical axes of cervical motion gained from in vitro experiments are in agreement with those gained from in vivo experiments, and therefore to prove its reliability.An in vitro test with pure moments and mono-segmental specimens was designed to investigate and compare the helical axes of the cervical spine.Six human cadaveric specimens (three male and three female) with an average age of 47.5 years (range: 34-58 years) were carefully selected. Each specimen was divided into three motion segments: C2-C3, C4-C5, and C6-C7. We performed 3.5 full cycles of rotation about all axes, flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation, by applying pure moments of 1.5 Nm without any preload. Following the in vitro tests, the three-dimensional helical axes were calculated and projected into the x-ray images.Rotation analysis of all three directions revealed similar results for all six specimens. All calculated helical axes were similar to the published in vivo data. Furthermore, the instantaneous centers of rotation were in agreement with in vivo data.The data gained from this study verify cervical kinematics during in vitro testing using pure moments. It can be assumed that other soft tissue such as muscles are not necessarily needed to simulate cervical kinematics in vitro.",0

We examined 72 parturients with abnormal anatomical conditions who were scheduled for epidural anaesthesia. The women were randomised into two equal groups. In all patients, the standard loss of resistance technique was used. In the ultrasound group, an ultrasound examination of the appropriate spinal region was conducted prior to epidural puncture. ES depth seen on the ultrasound images was compared to the ES depth measured by the needle. We compared the number of puncture attempts with the standard method (control group) to the number of attempts under ultrasound guidance.Ultrasonography significantly improved operating conditions for epidural anaesthesia. The maximum VAS scores and patient acceptance were significantly better.With ultrasound measurement of the ES depth, the quality of epidural anaesthesia was enhanced.",0

The aim of this study was to compare a standard endotracheal tube with the EndoFlex tracheal tube for intubation in patients with simulated cervical spine injury. Methods A group of 60 patients without any kind of the cervical spine injury, classified as the ASA physiological scale I or II and qualified for elective surgery procedures were intubated with the use of classical Macintosh laryngoscope, and either a standard endotracheal tube with the intubation stylet in it or EndoFlex tube without stylet. The subjects were randomized into two subgroups. All patients have had the cervical collar placed on their neck for the simulation of intubation procedure in case of the spinal injury. Results The intubation procedure was performed by 16 anesthetists with different experience (5-19 yrs). Time of intubation with the use of EndoFlex tube was similar to that with a the use of standard endotracheal tube and intubation stylet: Me (median) 19.5 s [IQR (interquatile range) 18-50] vs. Me 20 s [IQR 17-60] respectively (p = 0.9705). No significant additional maneuvers were necessary during intubation with the use of EndoFlex tube in comparison with standard endotracheal tube (70% vs. 56.6%) (p = 0.4220). Subjective assessment of the usability of both tubes revealed that more anesthesiologists found intubations with the use of EndoFlex more demanding than intubation with conventional tracheal tube and intubation stylet. The assessment of usability: very easy 3.3% vs. 20%, easy 83.4% vs. 56.7%, difficult 10% vs. 20% and very difficult 3.3% vs. 3.3% for standard endotracheal tube with stylet and EndoFlex, respectively. Conclusion In conclusion we asses, that the EndoFlex tube does not improve intubation success rate, in fact it requires more maneuvers facilitating intubation and was found to be more difficult to use.",0

Phone and email-based administration of patient-reported outcomes instruments is a less cumbersome approach for increasing response rates and assessment frequency while potentially decreasing follow-up burden on patients and physicians.This study sought to validate simultaneous administration of the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) questionnaires in patients with either cervical myelopathy and/or radiculopathy.This is a single-center, randomized crossover phone and email validation of legacy outcome measures for cervical myelopathy and/or radiculopathy patients.The study included nonsurgical along with pre- and postsurgical cervical myelopathy and/or radiculopathy patients presenting to a tertiary spine care center.NDI and JOA.Two-hundred and six patients (mean age: 58.5 years) were randomized in a 1:4 ratio to either email completion of the NDI and JOA before or after in-office completion, or to phone completion before or after in-office completion. An interval of 1 to 4 weeks was established between the administration of questionnaires. The difference between written in-office and corresponding email and phone versions was assessed with a paired t test. Homogeneity was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients. Test-retest reliabilities were independently examined for postoperative patients (n=145). Recall bias was assessed in postoperative patients by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients for those with days between assessments lesser than the mean and for those greater. Differences in response rates between phone and email versions were assessed with McNemar's and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.There was no significant difference between email and in-office versions (n=85) of the NDI (p=.17, Mean Paired Difference=1.34) and JOA (p=.64, Mean Paired Difference=0.11). No significant difference was seen between phone followed by in-office administration (n=32) of the NDI (p=.88, Mean Paired Difference=0.22) and JOA (p=.38, Mean Paired Difference=-0.22), nor between in-office administration followed by phone (n=44) for the NDI (p=.10, Mean Paired Difference=2.79) and JOA (p=.37, Mean Paired Difference=0.27). Intraclass coefficients (ICCs) of the email versions of the NDI and JOA were 0.88 and 0.78, respectively; of the phone-before-office versions of the NDI and JOA were 0.91 and 0.82; of the office-before-phone versions were 0.86 and 0.78. Similarly, strong intraclass correlation coefficients indicative of a lack of recall bias were found for ""In-Office"" and external assessments completed by postsurgical patients with days between assessments lesser and greater than the mean (ICC range 0.63-0.92). No significant difference was seen in completion rates between email and in-office questionnaire completion (p=.13) and phone-before-office and in-office questionnaire completion (p=.31). However, a significant difference was found in completion rates for phone-after-office questionnaires (p<.001).Administration of the NDI and JOA over phone and email in patients with cervical myelopathy or radiculopathy is valid with strong test-retest reliability and internal consistency. Phone and email administration of the NDI and JOA can reduce nonresponse rates and decrease the burden of follow-up and data acquisition.

As another indication of excellent adherence and compliance, the cardiorespiratory fitness (aerobic threshold) increased by 13% in the exercise group. The 2% decrease in the reference group is regarded as an age-related change in cardiorespiratory fitness. Regardless of the group, there was no association between the increase in aerobic threshold and change in BMD. In the entire group, age-related bone loss was seen in the femoral neck BMD and BMDvol (p < 0.01). BMD and BMDvol values increased with age in L2-L4 (p < 0.004). An increased rate of bone loss at the femoral neck was observed in men with a low energy-adjusted calcium intake (p = 0.003). Men who increased their alcohol intake during the intervention showed a decrease in the rate of bone loss at the femoral neck (p = 0.040). A decrease in body height associated with decreased total femoral BMD (r = 0.19, p = 0.04) and the change in body height was a predictor of bone loss in the femoral neck (beta = 0.201). Long-term regular aerobic physical activity in middle-aged men had no effect on the age-related loss of femoral BMD. On the other hand, possible structural alterations, which are also essential for the mechanical strength of bone, can not be detected by the DXA measurements used in this study. The increase seen in lumbar BMD reflects age-related changes in the spine, thus making it an unreliable site for BMD follow-up in men.",0

Change in bone mineral density at one year following glucocorticoid withdrawal in kidney transplant recipients. Clin Transplant 2011: 25: E113–E123. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract: Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy induces deleterious effects on the skeleton in kidney transplantation but studies of GC discontinuation in this population are limited. This study evaluated changes in areal bone mineral density (BMD) with GC withdrawal. Subjects were enrolled one yr after renal transplantation and randomized to continue or stop prednisone; all subjects continued cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. BMD measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was performed at enrollment and repeated at one yr and values were standardized. Mean ± standard deviation of annualized change in standardized BMD between GC withdrawal vs. continuation group at the lumbar spine was +4.7% ± 5.5 vs. +0.9% ± 5.3 (p = 0.0014); total hip +2.4% ± 4.2 vs. −0.4% ± 4.2 (p = 0.013), and femoral neck +2.1% ± 4.6 vs. +1.0% ± 6.0 (p = 0.37). There was no confounding by prednisone dose prior to enrollment, change in creatinine clearance, weight, or use of bone-active medications following study entry. Multivariate analysis determined that the change in BMD was positively associated with baseline alkaline phosphatase and creatinine clearance and negatively associated with baseline BMD. BMD improves with GC withdrawal after renal transplantation, and this gain in BMD is dependent on the baseline bone turnover, renal function, and BMD.",0

Two commonly used methods (the FI compartment and 3-in-1 blocks) have produced inconsistent results with respect to local anesthetic distribution and effect on the ON. To date, no study of either method has been performed using advanced imaging techniques to document both needle placement and local anesthetic distribution. We report the outcome of a series of 3-in-1 and FI blocks performed using ultrasound to guide needle position and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to define local anesthetic distribution.Patients were prospectively studied, and images were interpreted using a randomized and blinded protocol.The study was performed in the perioperative area of an academic orthopedic specialty hospital.Ten patients (ASA 1-2) having anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction received either 3-in-1 or FI compartment blocks for postoperative analgesia using the surface landmarks described for these techniques.Ultrasound was used to position the injecting needle immediately deep to the FI. Local anesthetic distribution was studied using MRI.Patients were examined for motor and/or sensory function of the femoral, obturator, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to document the limits of injectate distribution.Magnetic resonance imaging showed distribution of injectate over the surface of the iliacus and psoas muscles to the level of the retroperitoneum. No patient showed medial extension of injectate to the ON. At the level of the inguinal ligament, injectate extended laterally toward the anterior superior iliac spine and medially to the femoral vein. All patients had significant weakness with extension of the knee and sensory loss over the anterior, lateral, and medial thigh. No patient demonstrated decreased hip adductor strength.Ultrasound and MRI show consistent superior extension of local anesthetic to the level of the retroperitoneum for both techniques. There was reliable clinical effect on the femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves. However, none of the injections produced evidence of ON block either at the level of the retroperitoneum or the inguinal ligament.",0

TEA in cardiac surgery, however, is controversial because the insertion of an epidural catheter in patients requiring full heparinization for cardiopulmonary bypass may lead to an epidural hematoma. The clinical effects of fast-track GA plus TEA were compared with those of with fast-track GA alone.A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 654 elective cardiac surgical patients who were randomly assigned to combined GA and TEA versus GA alone. Follow-up was at 30 days and 1 yr after surgery. The primary endpoint was 30-day survival free from myocardial infarction, pulmonary complications, renal failure, and stroke.Thirty-day survival free from myocardial infarction, pulmonary complications, renal failure, and stroke was 85.2% in the TEA group and 89.7% in the GA group (P = 0.23). At 1 yr follow-up, survival free from myocardial infarction, pulmonary complications, renal failure, and stroke was 84.6% in the TEA group and 87.2% in the GA group (P = 0.42). Postoperative pain scores were low in both groups.This study was unable to demonstrate a clinically relevant benefit of TEA on the frequency of major complications after elective cardiac surgery, compared with fast-track cardiac anesthesia without epidural anesthesia. Given the potentially devastating complications of an epidural hematoma after insertion of an epidural catheter, it is questionable whether this procedure should be applied routinely in cardiac surgical patients who require full heparinization.",0

Global rating of change questions relating to pain and function levels was also administered. <h3>METHODS</h3> Baseline scores were compared with follow-up scores at four different time-points from 3-months to 6-months and beyond. Patient demographics, mean scores, paired-sample <i>t</i> tests, Standardized Response Mean (SRM), and Effect Size (ES) were analyzed to determine instrument responsiveness. This project was funded by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under award number U01AR067138 and the authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose. <h3>RESULTS</h3> The PROMIS instruments were strongly correlated with each other as well as with the NDI and ODI. Responsiveness was significant on all four instruments at every time-point assessed (paired sample <i>t</i> tests ranged from p < .001 to p = .049). SRM's were large and over 0.94 for every instrument at every time-point. Cohen's d ES were large and over 0.96 for all at all time-points, except for the NDI which had ES ranging from 0.74 to 0.83. This study showed large effect sizes and responsiveness of the PROMIS PF, PROMIS PI, NDI and ODI in a population of orthopaedic patients with spine pathologies. <h3>CONCLUSION</h3> This study demonstrates strong responsiveness of the PROMIS PF and PROMIS PI in a spine clinic population.",0

In two groups, a thoracic epidural catheter was inserted preoperatively. Group Pre-TEA had bupivacaine and morphine solution preoperatively and intraoperatively. Postoperative analgesia was maintained with epidural PCA with a similar solution. Group Post-TEA, with no intraoperative medication, had the same postoperative analgesia as Group Pre-TEA plus the bolus dose. Group IV-PCA received only IV-PCA with morphine for postoperative analgesia. Pain was evaluated every 4 h during the first 48 h at rest, cough, and movement. Pre-TEA was associated with decreased pain compared with the other groups. Six months later, the patients were asked about their pain. The incidence and the intensity of pain were most frequent in Group IV-PCA (78%) and were the least in Group Pre-TEA (45%) (Group Pre-TEA versus Group IV-PCA, P = 0.0233; Group Pre-TEA versus Group IV-PCA, P = 0.014). Patients having pain on the second postoperative day had 83% chronic pain. TEA with preoperative initiation is a preferable method in preventing acute and long-term thoracotomy pain.Preoperatively initiated thoracic epidural analgesia has the most satisfying results in controlling postthoracotomy pain in the acute and long-term period, and it is associated with a decreased incidence (and intensity) of chronic pain compared with postoperative (epidural or IV) analgesia. Chronic pain has an incidence of 62%.",0

The objective is to assess the joint kinematics of the surgeon during spine surgery.We enrolled 18 spine surgeons, who each performed pedicle screw placement, and used an optoelectronic motion analysis system. Using three-dimensional (3D) motion images, distance changes in five joints and angle changes in six joints were calculated during surgery.Distance fluctuations increased gradually from the proximal to the distal joint. Angle fluctuations were largest at the distal point but did not gradually increase, and the elbow showed the second largest fluctuation. Changes along the X axis were larger than those of the Y and Z axes.The distances gradually increased from proximal portions of the body to the hand. In angle changes, the elbow was most dynamic during pedicle screw placement. The surgeons' whole joints carry out a harmonic role during lumbar pedicle screw placement.

The main objective of this study was to examine the effect of estrogen and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D therapy given individually or in combination on bone loss in elderly women. Four hundred eighty-nine elderly women with normal bone density for their age, aged 65-77 yr, were entered into a randomized double blind, placebo-controlled trial. Women were randomized to one of four groups: conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg, daily) to women without a uterus (estrogen replacement therapy) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg, daily) to women with a uterus (hormone replacement therapy), calcitriol (0.25 microg twice daily), a combination of hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy plus calcitriol, or placebos for 3 yr. The primary outcome was the change in bone mineral density of the femoral neck and spine. In the intent to treat analysis, hormone therapy (hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy) produced a mean (+/-1 SD) increase in bone mineral density of 2.98% (+/-5.45%) at the femoral neck (P < 0.0001) and 4.36% (+/-6.42%) at the spine (P < 0.0001). There were parallel increases in total hip and trochanter bone mineral density. Calcitriol increased bone mineral density 0.10% (+/- 4.27%) at the femoral neck (P = 0.57) and 1.65% (+/- 4.83%) at the spine (P < 0.0124). The combination of hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy + calcitriol increased bone mineral density 3.80% (+/-4.95%) at the femoral neck (P < 0.001), 4.91% (+/-6.0%) at the spine (P < 0.0001), and parallel changes at the total hip and trochanter. All three treatment groups differed significantly from placebo at the spine and for the hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy groups at the femoral neck, spine, total hip and trochanter. There were no significant differences between combination therapy and hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy alone on bone mineral density at any site in the intent to treat analysis. In a secondary analysis of the effect in women who were adherent to treatment, calcitriol had a more significant effect on spine (P = 0.003) and total hip (P = 0.004). The increase in bone mineral density in the adherent groups of women was always higher compared with the intent to treat groups. Combination therapy compared with hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy alone produced a significantly greater response in trochanter (P = 0.007) and total hip bone mineral density (P = 0.0017). In summary, hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy alone and in combination with calcitriol therapy was highly effective in reducing bone resorption and increasing bone mineral density at the hip and other clinically relevant sites in a group of elderly women, with normal bone density for their age. Calcitriol was effective in increasing spine bone mineral density. In the adherent women, combination therapy with hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy and calcitriol increased bone mineral density significantly more in the total hip and trochanter than did hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy alone.",0

One hundred and seventeen patients with a reduced BMD (T score < or = -1) were randomly assigned to treatment with alendronate and calcium (n=60) versus calcitriol and calcium (n=57). Of these, 46 and 51 patients, respectively, completed 1 year of treatment. Forty-nine patients who were not eligible or did not consent to the trial were followed prospectively.Reduced baseline BMD (T score < or = -1) was present in 159 (78.7%) of patients at the lumbar spine or femur. There was no significant loss of BMD in the prospectively followed patients during 2.7 years. The average lumbar BMD increased from 0.984+/-0.149 to 1.025+/-0.143 g/cm2 (P<0.001) with alendronate and from 1.014+/-0.15 to 1.034+/-0.146 g/cm2 (P=0.002) with calcitriol. BMD at the femur increased from 0.809+/-0.092 to 0.836+/-0.107 g/cm2 (P<0.001) with alendronate and from 0.830+/-0.144 to 0.857+/-0.125 g/cm2 (P=0.023) with calcitriol.One year of treatment with alendronate or calcitriol, both with calcium supplementation, resulted in significant increases in BMD at the lumbar spine and femur, with a trend toward alendronate being more effective at the spine (P=0.082). Further studies are needed to determine whether BMDs continue to increase after 1 year and whether there is any additional benefit to combining vitamin D and alendronate. Larger studies are needed to determine whether treatment decreases fracture rates.",0

This was a prospective 24-month single-center interventional two-arm study in 220 women and similarly aged men (median age 40.7 years) with a body mass index (BMI) >38 kg/m(2) after RYGB and SG procedures. Patients were randomized into: 1) an intervention group receiving: 28,000 IU cholecalciferol/wk for 8 weeks before bariatric surgery, 16,000 IU/wk and 1000 mg calciummonocitrate/d after surgery, daily BMI-adjusted protein supplementation and physical exercise (Nordic walking, strength perseverance, and equipment training); 2) a non-intervention group: no preoperative loading, nutritional supplementation, or obligatory physical exercise. At study endpoint, when comparing the intervention group to the non-intervention group, the relative percentage changes of serum levels of sclerostin (12.1% versus 63.8%), cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX, 82.6% versus 158.3%), 25-OH vitamin D (13.4% versus 18.2%), phosphate (23.7% versus 32%, p < 0.001 for all), procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP, 12% versus 41.2%), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH, -17.3% versus -7.6%), and Dickkopf-1 (-3.9% versus -8.9%, p < 0.05 for all) differed. The decline in lumbar spine, total hip and total body aBMD, changes in BMI, lean body mass (LBM), as well as changes in trabecular bone score (TBS) values (p < 0.005 for all) were less, but significantly, pronounced in the intervention group. We conclude that vitamin D loading and ongoing vitamin D, calcium, and BMI-adjusted protein supplementation in combination with physical exercise decelerates the loss of aBMD and LBM after bariatric surgery. Moreover, the well-known increases of bone turnover markers are less pronounced.",0

In the current study, we used direct epidural cortical stimulation (EpCS) to examine regional specificity of PFC stimulation on the parietally-maximal late positive potential (LPP), an event-related potential (ERP) biomarker of visual attention to salient stimuli. Five patients with treatment-resistant mood disorders were stereotactically implanted with stimulating paddles over frontopolar (FP) and dorsolateral (DL) prefrontal cortex bilaterally. On their first day of activation, patients underwent sham-controlled EpCS coupled with 64-channel electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings and passive viewing of aversive and neutral images. In addition to sham, patients had either FP or DL prefrontal cortex stimulated at 2 or 4 V while they viewed neutral and aversive pictures. As expected during the sham condition, LPP was larger for aversive compared to neutral stimuli (F(1,4)=232.07, P<.001). Stimulation of DL compared to FP prefrontal cortex resulted in a reduction of the LPP (F(1,4)=8.15, P=.048). These data provide additional and unique support to the role of the DL prefrontal cortex in regulating measures of neural activity that have been linked to emotional arousal and attention. Future studies with EpCS can help directly map out various prefrontal functions in treatment-resistant mood disorder.",0

We conducted this study to evaluate the accuracy, time savings, radiation doses, and pain relief of US-guided pararadicular injections versus CT-controlled interventions in the lumbar spine in a prospective randomized clinical trial.Forty adult patients were consecutively enrolled and assigned to a US or CT group. US-guided pararadicular injections were performed on a standard US device by using a broadband curved-array transducer (9-4 or 5-1 MHz). In the in-plane technique, the needle was advanced through the respective segmental intertransverse ligament. The needle tip position was verified by CT. The CT-guided approaches were performed under standardized procedures by using the CT-positioning laser function.The accuracy of US-guided interventions was 90%. The mean time to final needle placement in the US group was 4.0 ± 1.8 minutes, and in the CT group, 7.6 ± 2.1 minutes. The mean radiation doses, including CT confirmation for study purposes only, were 20.3 ± 9.0 mGy cm for the US group and 42.6 ± 36.1 mGy cm for the CT group. Both groups showed the same significant pain relief (P < .05) without relevant ""intermethodic"" differences of pain relief (P > .05).US-guided pararadicular injections show a therapeutic effect similar to that in the time-consuming, expensive, ionizing CT or fluoroscopically guided pararadicular injections and result in a significant reduction of procedure time expenditure and avoidance of radiation.",0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre-treatment and 2-year follow-up MRI was performed in 126 patients randomized to disc prosthesis surgery or non-surgical treatment. Two experienced radiologists independently evaluated progress and regress for Modic changes, disc findings, and facet arthropathy (FA) at L3/L4, L4/L5, and L5/S1, both by non-comparison and by comparison of initial and follow-up images. FA was evaluated at all levels, and other findings at non-operated levels. We calculated prevalence- and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) values for interobserver agreement. The impact of an adjacent prosthesis (which causes artefacts) and image evaluation method on PABAK was assessed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Image comparison indicated good interobserver agreement on progress and regress (PABAK 0.63-1.00) for Modic changes, posterior high-intensity zone, disc height, and disc contour at L3-S1 and for nucleus pulposus signal and FA at L3/L4; and moderate interobserver agreement (PABAK 0.46-0.59) on decreasing nucleus signal and increasing FA at L4-S1. Image comparison indicated lower (but fair) interobserver agreement (PABAK 0.29) only for increasing FA at L5/S1 in patients with prosthesis in L4/L5 and/or L5/S1. An adjacent prosthesis had no overall impact on PABAK values (p ? 0.22). Comparison yielded higher PABAK values than non-comparison (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Regarding changes in lumbar MRI findings over time, comparison of images can provide moderate or good interobserver agreement, and better agreement than non-comparison. An adjacent prosthesis may not reduce agreement on change for most findings.",0

Preventing the bone loss, which may threaten the prosthesis survival, with an antiresorptive drug would be highly advantageous. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study investigated the effect of cyclic etidronate therapy on periprosthetic, contralateral hip, and spine bone mineral density (BMD) in a one-year, prospective, randomized, double-blind study in 31 patients after cemented hip arthroplasty. Etidronate was taken orally in a regimen repeated every 14 weeks, and periprosthetic BMD was measured with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in the total periprosthetic area and in the seven Gruen zones at 1 week (baseline), 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS: In the etidronate group there were significant temporal BMD decreases measured in Gruen zones 2, 3, 6, and 7 and in the entire proximal femur; the greatest decrease was 12.9% and was measured in zone 7 at six months. Also in the etidronate group, there was a significant 2.8% temporal BMD increase in the spine at 12 months. In the placebo group there were significant temporal BMD decreases measured in Gruen zones 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 and in the entire proximal femur; the greatest decrease was 25.5% and was measured in zone 7 at 12 months. There were no significant differences between the mean BMD measurements of the etidronate and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that cyclic etidronate therapy has no significant effect in suppressing periprosthetic bone loss after cemented hip arthroplasty.",0

In addition, bone biopsy with histomorphometry was performed in a subset of subjects.

All of the women received a supplement of 500 mg calcium daily. At 2 yr, placebo-treated patients showed a mean 0.6% loss in lumbar spine BMD, compared with mean increases in women receiving alendronate, CEE, and alendronate plus CEE of 6.0% (P < 0.001 vs. placebo), 6.0% (P < 0.001 vs. placebo), and 8.3% (P < 0.001 vs. placebo and CEE; P = 0.022 vs. alendronate), respectively. The corresponding changes in total proximal femur bone mineral density were +4.0%, +3.4%, +4.7%, and +0.3% for the alendronate, estrogen, alendronate plus estrogen, and placebo groups, respectively. Both alendronate and CEE significantly decreased biochemical markers of bone turnover, specifically urinary N-telopeptide of type I collagen and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase. The alendronate plus CEE combination produced slightly greater decreases in these markers than either treatment alone, but the mean absolute values remained within the normal premenopausal range. Alendronate, alone or in combination with CEE, was well tolerated. In the subset of patients who underwent bone biopsies, histomorphometry showed normal bone histology with the expected decrease in bone turnover, which was somewhat more pronounced in the combination group. Thus, alendronate and estrogen produced favorable effects on BMD. Combined use of alendronate and estrogen produced somewhat larger increases in BMD than either agent alone and was well tolerated.",0

Eighty patients with low back pain of at least 6 weeks' duration were randomized into the following 2 groups: standardized exercise therapy with functional electrical muscle stimulation or standardized exercise therapy with placebo electrical stimulation. Subjects were evaluated at baseline, 2 months, and 6 months with a standardized back pain questionnaire and objective measurements of lumbar spine function. Exercise therapy was continued for 6 months, but electrical stimulation was discontinued at the 2-month interval. Of the 80 patients initially enrolled, 42 discontinued or withdrew before completing the entire study protocol. At the 2-month follow-up interval, subjects in the treatment group had statistically significantly improved lumbar spine function compared with the control subjects. This effect continued during the last 4 months of the study after electrical stimulation had been discontinued. This suggests that electrical muscle stimulation can be an effective adjunctive treatment modality for nonacute low back pain. The effects of this combined therapy seem to last beyond the duration of electrical stimulation treatment.",0

Sixty patients with cervical spondylosis and calcification of NL were selected and randomly assigned to three groups: A, B, and C. Patients in Group A received rehabilitation with 20 minutes of hot packs and underwent 15 minutes of intermittent cervical traction three times/week for 6 weeks. Patients in Group B received the same rehabilitation as those in Group A and ESWT (2000 impulses, 0.27 mJ/mm(2)) over the calcified NL guided by X-ray image. Patients in Group C received the same treatment as those in Group B, but the ESWT was guided by musculoskeletal sonography. The therapeutic effects were evaluated by: changes in range of motion (ROM) of the cervical spine including flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation; visual analog pain scale; and Neck Disability Index before and after treatment and at follow up 3 months later. We found a significant reduction in pain in each treated group after treatment and at follow up. However, patients in Groups B and C showed more improvements in ROM and neck pain relief after treatment and a decrease in Neck Disability Index. Furthermore, patients in Group C showed better cervical ROM at follow up than Group B. ESWT is an adjuvant treatment in the management of cervical spondylosis with calcification of NL and ultrasound-guided ESWT results in more functional improvements.",0

The aims of our study were to investigate whether the use of low-dose corticosteroids is associated with a reduction in posttransplant bone loss and to assess the ability of cholecalciferol supplementation to further decrease bone loss in this setting.Ninety patients admitted for renal transplantation and scheduled to be treated per protocol with low doses of prednisolone were randomized to receive either 400 mg daily oral calcium (Ca group, n=44) or the same dose of calcium in association with a monthly dose of 25,000 IU of vitamin D3 (CaVitD group, n=46). Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual energy absorptiometry at baseline and at 1 year.The overall population experienced a moderate but significant -2.3+/-0.9% loss of lumbar spine BMD (P<0.01) but no bone loss at the femoral neck and shaft during the first posttransplant year. Bone loss tended to be slightly higher in the CaVitD group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Patients in the CaVitD group had significantly higher 25(OH) but not 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D levels. We observed a highly significant negative correlation between 25(OH) vitamin D and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum levels.Kidney-transplant recipients receiving modern immunosuppressive regimens with low doses of corticosteroids experience only minimal loss of BMD during the first posttransplant year. Cholecalciferol supplementation did not prevent posttransplant bone loss but contributed to the normalization of iPTH levels after renal transplantation.",0

All patients received pain drugs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and after 7 days, all patients started a standardized physiotherapy program 2 to 3 times a week.Patients' pain and disability scores were assessed using visual analog scales and ROM was assessed using a goniometer. All parameters were measured within 24 hours after injury and after 2 and 6 months.After 2 months, the different periods of immobilization (2d or 10d) were associated with comparable improvements in pain symptoms (median, 4.60 vs 4.65), ROM (median, 100.0 degrees vs 117.5 degrees ), and disability score (median, 4.90 vs 5.15). No statistically significant differences could be identified between the 2 treatment groups. After 6 months, persistent pain was reported by 4 patients in each group (12.5%).In patients with QTF grade II whiplash injuries, there is no short- or long-term difference between 2-day and 10-day immobilization with a cervical collar in terms of pain, ROM, or disability.",0

This study was designed to measure the withdrawal forces needed to remove lumbar spinal catheters and to determine whether patient position affects withdrawal forces.Eighty-two patients with a 24-gauge spinal catheter placed midline at the lumbar L3/4 or L4/5 level were randomly assigned to catheter removal either in flexed lateral or sitting position. Withdrawal forces were measured using a tension spring balance.Mean withdrawal force was 0.91 N (95% CI: 0.73, 1.09) with extremes up to 5 N. Withdrawal force in the flexed lateral position was 1.04 N (95% CI: 0.73, 1.34) or in the sitting position was 0.78 N (95% CI: 0.59, 0.97). The 95% CI for the difference of the means was -0.62 N, 0.10 N. Thus, the absolute mean difference between the positions can be assumed to be smaller than 0.62 N. Neither the length of the spinal catheter under the skin or in the subarachnoid space, nor BMI influenced withdrawal force.Withdrawal force of spinal catheters is not influenced by body position during catheter removal, length of catheter under skin, or BMI.",0

The present study was undertaken to assess the incidence of blood vessel puncture related to epidural catheterization in three different body positions, in a cohort of morbidly obese parturients, following the completion of a similar study published in 2001 from which such parturients were excluded.The study was conducted in 450 (three groups of 150) morbidly obese, obstetric patients undergoing continuous epidural analgesia during labour. Epidural catheterization was performed on patients randomized to the sitting, lateral recumbent horizontal, or lateral recumbent head-down position.There was a lower incidence of vessel cannulation when this procedure was performed in the lateral recumbent head-down position [1.3%; body mass index (BMI): 37.0] than in the lateral recumbent horizontal [12.9%; BMI: 38.0] and in the sitting position [12.0%; BMI: 38.0]. The incidence of accidental subarachnoid puncture was 2%, 1.3% and 2% respectively, in these same positions.Adoption of the lateral recumbent head-down position for the performance of lumbar epidural blockade, in labour at term, reduces the incidence of lumbar epidural venous puncture in these obese parturients.",0

In this study, we evaluated the addition of epidural clonidine and/or bupivacaine, injected at the incision site, on postoperative outcome variables in patients undergoing lower spine procedures using spinal anesthesia. One hundred twenty patients having lumbar spine surgery received bupivacaine spinal anesthesia supplemented by 150 microg of epidural clonidine with or without incisional bupivacaine, epidural placebo plus incisional bupivacaine, or placebo with incisional saline. Demographic data, intraoperative hemodynamics, blood loss, pain, nausea, urinary retention, hospital discharge, and other variables were compared by using either analysis of variance or chi(2) analysis. Demographics were similar. IV fluids, blood loss, incidence of intraoperative bradycardia, and hypotension were not different among groups. Postanesthesia care unit pain scores were lower and demand for analgesics was less in patients who received both the clonidine and subcutaneous bupivacaine. Patients who received epidural clonidine also had improved postoperative hemodynamics. Hospital discharge, urinary retention, and other variables were not different. We conclude that epidural clonidine as a supplement to spinal anesthesia produced no perioperative complications and improved postoperative pain and hemodynamic stability in patients undergoing lower spine procedures. IMPLICATIONS Spinal anesthesia with supplemental epidural clonidine in combination with incision site subcutaneous bupivacaine was evaluated both intra- and postoperatively and compared with spinal anesthesia alone for lower lumbar spine procedures. Both epidural clonidine and subcutaneous incisional bupivacaine, added to spinal anesthesia for lumbar spine surgery, improves pain relief and reduces the need for postoperative opioids with their associated side effects.",0

Studies have shown synergism between gabapentin and morphine in animal and human experiments and in the treatment of incisional pain. Therefore, the authors investigated, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, the effects of gabapentin on acute postoperative pain and morphine consumption in patients undergoing spinal surgery. Methods After standard premedication, 25 patients in the control group received oral placebo, and 25 patients in the gabapentin group received 1,200 mg of gabapentin, 1 h before surgery in a randomized fashion. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and cisatracurium and was maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The total intraoperative remifentanil consumption by each patient was noted. All patients postoperatively received patient-controlled analgesia with morphine (1 mg/ml) with an incremental dose of 2 mg, a lockout interval of 10 min, and a 4-h limit of 40 mg. The incremental dose was increased to 3 mg, and the 4-h limit to 50 mg, if analgesia was inadequate after 1 h. Patients were questioned for the first 1 h in the PACU and were later evaluated in the ward at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h. Pain scores, heart rate, oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry, mean blood pressure, respiratory rate, sedation, morphine use, and total dose of morphine were recorded. Results Overall, pain scores at 1, 2, and 4 h were significantly lower in the gabapentin group when compared with the placebo group. Total morphine consumption in the gabapentin group was 16.3 +/- 8.9 mg (mean +/- SD) versus 42.8 +/- 10.9 mg in the placebo patients. The incidence of vomiting and urinary retention was significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.05) higher in the placebo group, but there was no difference in incidence of other adverse effects between the groups. Conclusions Preoperative oral gabapentin decreased pain scores in the early postoperative period and postoperative morphine consumption in spinal surgery patients while decreasing some morphine-associated side effects.",0

In 36 of 51 patients who accepted the procedure, an epidural catheter was inserted (L1-L2 level). General anesthesia was induced with propofol and sufentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane in O2/N2O. After emergence from anesthesia, epidural analgesia was initiated according to two randomly assigned protocols: 1 mg of morphine with 75 microg of clonidine (Group M) or 12.5 mg of bupivacaine with 75 microg of clonidine (Group B), in 10 mL saline. Piritramide was administered during the first postoperative 24 hours using a patient-controlled analgesia device (PCA). The following parameters were recorded: piritramide consumption during the first 24 hours; pain at rest during the first postoperative hours (D0), during the first night (D1), and during the first mobilization; [visual analogue scale (VAS)]; and the occurrence of drowsiness, motor blockade, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, itching, micturition problems, and bladder catheterization during D0 and D1. Epidural administration of morphine-clonidine significantly improved postoperative pain relief and reduced piritramide consumption as compared to epidural bupivacaine-clonidine. Side effects did not differ between groups except for a higher incidence of micturition problems in Group M during D1. The occurrence of bladder catheterization was not significantly higher in that group. We conclude that a low dose of epidural morphine combined with clonidine offers a better postoperative analgesia than does bupivacaine-clonidine. The excellent analgesic conditions were obtained at the expense of a higher incidence of difficulties in initiating micturition.",0

TRACP 5b had higher clinical sensitivity, area under the ROC curve, and signal-to-noise ratio than the other markers.The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical performance of serum TRACP 5b (S-TRACP5b) with that of other markers of bone turnover in the monitoring of alendronate treatment.This double-blinded study included 148 healthy postmenopausal women that were randomly assigned into two groups: one receiving 5 mg alendronate daily (n=75) and the other receiving placebo (n=73) for 12 months. All individuals in both groups received calcium and vitamin D daily. The bone resorption markers S-TRACP5b, serum C-terminal cross-linked telopeptides of type I collagen (S-CTX), and total urinary deoxypyridinoline (U-DPD), and the serum markers of bone formation procollagen I N-terminal propeptide (S-PINP), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (S-BALP), and total osteocalcin (S-OC) were assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation of treatment. Lumbar spine BMD (LBMD) was measured at baseline and 12 months.Compared with the placebo group, LBMD increased, and all bone markers decreased significantly more in the alendronate group (p<0.001 for each parameter). The decrease of S-TRACP5b after first 3 months of alendronate treatment correlated significantly with the changes of all other markers except S-OC, the best correlation being with S-CTX (r=0.60, p<0.0001). The changes of LBMD at 12 months only correlated significantly with the changes of S-TRACP5b (r=-0.32, p=0.005) and S-CTX (r=-0.24, p=0.037) at 3 months. Based on clinical sensitivity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and signal-to-noise ratio, S-TRACP5b, S-CTX, and S-PINP were the best markers for monitoring alendronate treatment. Clinical sensitivity, area under the ROC curve, and signal-to-noise ratio were higher for S-TRACP5b than for the other markers.These results show that S-TRACP5b, S-CTX, and S-PINP are useful markers for monitoring alendronate treatment.",0

The aim of the current study was first to analyze the effect of intramedullary spinal cord changes in signal intensity (hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging and hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on surgical opportunity and approach for cervical myelopathy due to OPLL. This was a prospective randomized controlled study. Fifty-six patients with cervical myelopathy due to OPLL were enrolled and assigned to either group A (receiving anterior decompression and fusion, n = 27) or group P (receiving posterior laminectomy, n = 29). All the patients were followed up for an average 20.3 months (12-34 months). The clinical outcomes were assessed by the average operative time, blood loss, Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, improvement rate (IR) and complication. To determine the relevant statistics, we made two factorial designs and regrouped the data of all patients to group H (with hyperintensity on MRI, n = 31), group L (with hypointensity on MRI, n = 19) and group N (no signal on MRI, n = 25), and then to further six subgroups as well: AH (with hyperintensity on MRI from group A, n = 15), PH (with hyperintensity on MRI from group P, n = 16), AL (with hypointensity on MRI from group A, n = 10), PL (with hypointensity on MRI from group P, n = 9), AN (no signal intensity on MRI from group A, n = 12) and PN (no signal intensity on MRI from group P, n = 13). Both hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging and hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging had a close relationship with the JOA score and IR. The pre- and postoperative JOA score and postoperative IR of either group H or group L was significantly lower than that of group N (P < 0.05), regardless of whether the patients had received anterior or posterior surgery. On the other hand, both the JOA score and IR of subgroup AH were higher than those of subgroup PH at 1 week, 6 and 12 months postoperatively (P < 0.05), as well as between subgroup AL and PL; but in group N, there was no difference between the subgroup AN and PN (P > 0.05). In conclusion, regardless of hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging or hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging in patients with OPLL, severe damage to the spinal cord is indicated. Surgical treatment should be provided before the advent of intramedullary spinal cord changes in signal intensity on MRI. The anterior approach is more effective than posterior approach for treating cervical myelopathy due to OPLL characterized by intramedullary spinal cord changes in signal intensity on MRI.",0

Patients were randomized into 4 groups: group I received daily alfacalcidol 0.5 microg PO; group II received oral alendronate 5 mg/day; group III received intranasal salmon calcitonin 200 IU every other day; and group IV was considered a control group. Every patient was supplemented with daily 500 mg oral calcium carbonate. Parameters of bone metabolism were measured before and at 12 months after starting treatment. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by (DEXA) at lumber spine, femoral neck, and forearm before and after treatment period.BMD was increased at lumber spine by 2.1%, 0.8%, 1.7%, by 1.8%, 0.6%, 1.6% at femoral neck, and by 3.2%, 1.9%, 2.6% at forearm in groups I, II, and III, respectively, while it decreased by 3.2%, 3.8%, and 1.8% at the same sites, respectively, in control group (P= <0.05). iPTH level decreased significantly in group I, while the decrease was insignificant in other groups (P= 0.003). All other parameters were not statistically significant between treatment groups. Apart from transient hypocalcaemia in 3 patients in group II, and 2 patients in group III, no other significant adverse effects were noted.This study proves that early bone loss that occurs during the first 12 months after renal transplantation could be prevented by alfacalcidol, calcitonin, or alendronate. Among the treatment groups, alfacalcidol significantly improved the hyperparathyroidism. All treatment drugs are safe and tolerable.",0

A pilot study,"The treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) remains controversial. A recently proposed treatment is multiple drilling core decompression combined with systemic alendronate as a femoral head-preserving procedure for ONFH. However, it is not known whether alendronate enhances the risk of collapse. We wondered whether the combined procedure could delay or prevent progression of ONFH compared to multiple drilling alone.Patients with early-stage ONFH were randomly assigned to be treated with either multiple drilling combined with alendronate (47 patients, 67 hips) or multiple drilling alone (46 patients, 60 hips). We defined failure as the need for THA or a Harris score less than 70. The minimum follow-up was 48 months for the 77 patients completing the protocol.After a minimum 4-year follow-up, 91% (40/44) of patients with Stage II disease and 62% (8/13) of patients with Stage III disease had not required THA in alendronate group, compared to 79% (31/39) of patients with Stage II disease and 46% (6/13) of patients with Stage III disease had not required THA in control group (P=0.12, P=0.047, respectively). Small or medium and central lesions had a better successful rate in both groups. Risk factors did not seem to affect the clinical successful rate of this procedure.Multiple small-diameter drilling core decompression combined with systemic alendronate administration can reduce pain and delay progression of early-stage ONFH. Even in Ficat IIA and III hips, some benefit was obtained from this approach at least delay in the need for THA.",0

This study aimed to observe the feasibility and safety of single spinal anesthesia administered with 25G needle through the lateral crypt for lower-extremity fracture surgery in elderly patients.The subjects were 60 elderly patients in our hospital (aged 65-80 years; ASA grades I and II) scheduled for lower-extremity fracture surgery (procedure was predicted to last within 2 h) under single spinal anesthesia by different approaches through L3-4. They were randomly divided into 2 groups: in the first group, 25G needle was used in a vertical approach (group C, n=30); in the second, 25G needle was passed through the inner edge of the small joints of L3-4 to the lateral crypt (group L, n=30). After successful completion of the puncture procedure, 2.5 mL of 0.5% hyperbaric ropivacaine was used for spinal anesthesia. We then recorded the puncture times, sensory block level, and adverse reactions (e.g., headache, lumbago, and lower limb pain).No significant differences in onset time, sensory block level and adverse reaction were noted between the 2 groups. The puncture success rate in group L was not significantly higher and the number of attempts per puncture was not significantly less than that in group C (93.3% vs 70%) (P = .063). Nerve-root irritation was more frequent in group L than in group C but with no significant difference (P > .05).Single spinal anesthesia through the lateral crypt approach is safe and effective for lower-extremity fracture surgery in elderly patients. Thus, this approach is a feasible alternative when the conventional approach fails.",0

Its effects on disc with degeneration have not been fully investigated.Forty-seven mature rats were used. Continuous static compression of 11 N was applied to the rat caudal 8-9 disc for 2 weeks to simulate disc degeneration. Tractions with different modes (static or intermittent) and magnitudes (1.4 N or 4.2 N) were applied to the degenerated disc for 3 weeks. The disc height was quantified in vivo on days 4, 18, and 39. The treated discs were then harvested for morphologic analysis.Significant decrease in disc height with degenerative morphologic changes was observed after the application of the static compression. The changes in disc height after the application of traction were found to be magnitude dependent. Continuous decrease in disc height was observed after 4.2-N traction, whereas the disc height maintained after traction of 1.4 N. However, no obvious morphologic change was found in comparison with the degenerated discs without traction.Although traction was not demonstrated to have restored disc with degeneration, traction with relatively low magnitude was found to have significant beneficial effect in maintaining disc height of degenerated disc, and it might be a potential intervention to slow down the process of degeneration. Future studies of the effects of low-magnitude traction on degenerated disc are recommended.",0

Maximal cerebral metabolic suppression is believed to coincide with electroencephalographic burst suppression. However, many neurosurgical procedures associated with cerebral ischemic threat are still performed in the absence of electroencephalogram monitoring, especially in developing nations. The present study was designed to assess the degree of burst suppression with 2 different doses of thiopentone sodium administered on the background of isoflurane anesthesia intraoperatively. Forty-one patients without any intracranial pathology undergoing elective spinal surgery under a general anesthetic consisting of N2O (60%) in O2 (40%) and isoflurane to maintain a bispectral index (BIS) value of 45 were randomized to receive a thiopentone bolus of either 3 or 5 mg/kg. BIS, burst suppression ratio (BSR), systolic blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded before the bolus and every 15 seconds for first 2 minutes and every 30 seconds for another 8 minutes. During the 10-minute study period after the administration of thiopentone bolus, BIS values were significantly lower in the group that received thiopentone 5 mg/kg compared with the group that received thiopentone 3 mg/kg (P<0.02). BSR>25% was seen in 7 out of 21 patients in the 3 mg/kg group and 10 out of 20 patients in the 5 mg/kg group. There was a statistically insignificant prolongation of the duration of burst suppression with thiopentone 5 mg/kg [243 s (range 75 to 435 s)] compared with thiopentone 3 mg/kg [171 s (30 to 465 s)]. The number of patients who had a BSR >50% was higher among patients who received thiopentone 5 mg/kg as compared with those who received a dose of 3 mg/kg [9/20 vs. 3/21(P<0.02)]. We conclude that thiopentone in a bolus dose of 3 to 5 mg/kg produces only a short duration of incomplete burst suppression. Also, in this dose range, burst suppression does not occur consistently in all patients. The present data suggest that bolus doses of thiopentone in the range of 3 to 5 mg/kg may have very limited value in providing significant metabolic suppression required for intraoperative cerebral protection during temporary ischemic episodes.",0

We hypothesised that preload optimisation targeted to stroke volume variation before turning prone might alleviate this. A supine threshold stroke volume variation of 14% in a preliminary study identified patients whose cardiac outputs would decline when turned prone. In 45 patients, cardiac output declined only in the group whose supine stroke volume variation was high (mean (SD) 5.1 (2.0) to 3.9 (1.9) l.min(-1) ; p < 0.001), but not in patients in whom it was low, or in those in whom stroke volume variation was high, but who received volume preload (p = 0.525 and 0.941, respectively). We conclude that targeted preload optimisation using a supine stroke volume variation value < 14% is effective in preventing falls in cardiac output induced by the prone position.",0

Comparison with the Boston brace,"The Boston brace (Bb) is the most widely used brace design to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). The dynamic SpineCor (SC) brace is prescribed in several scoliosis clinics worldwide, but its effectiveness remains controversial.The study aimed to compare the treatment effectiveness of SC in patients with AIS treated by the developers of the brace with that of the Bb at a single institution.This is a retrospective comparison between a cohort of AIS patients treated using the SC brace and a cohort treated using the Bb.We assessed 243 patients treated with either Bb or SC brace to prevent the progression of AIS.The primary outcome was the progression in main Cobb angle when reaching one of the following end point criteria: (1) progression in Cobb angle of ≥6°, (2) main Cobb angle of ≥45°, (3) surgery undertaken, or (4) reaching skeletal maturity (Risser sign of 5 or growth of <1 cm in the previous 6 months).Patients were identified at a single institution between 2000 and 2012 following the Scoliosis Research Society criteria for brace treatment: (1) diagnosis of AIS, (2) Risser sign of ≤2, (3) curve magnitude between 25° and 40°, and (4) age ≥10 years. A total of 97 patients treated with SC by the developers of the brace and 146 patients treated with Bb were identified. Data collection and radiograph measurements were performed by a single experienced nurse not involved in the decision-making for brace treatment or in the data analysis. Age and Risser sign at onset of treatment, initialmain Cobb angle, curve type, and duration of follow-up were similar in both cohorts. Statistical analysis was done using chi-square and logistic regression models, with a level of significance of .05.The average progression was 14.7°±11.9° in the SC cohort compared with 9.6°±13.7° in the Bb cohort (p=.003). The average Cobb angle at the end point of the study reached 47°±13° in the SC cohort and 41.7°±14.2° in the Bb cohort (p=.005), whereas at the onset of bracing it was 32.2°±4.9° and 32.2°±4.4°, respectively, for the SC and Bb cohorts. The percentage of patients with a progression of ≥6° was 76% in the SC cohort and 55% in the Bb cohort (p=.001). The proportion of patients reaching 45° in the SC and Bb cohorts was, respectively, 51% and 37% (p=.03), whereas the proportion of patients referred to surgery was 39% and 30%, respectively, for the SC and Bb cohorts (p=.2). The odds of progressing ≥6° and of reaching ≥45° were 2.67 and 2.07 times greater, respectively, when using the SC brace.The SC brace did not prevent curve progression as effectively as the Bb. Although it has the potential benefit of increasing mobility during brace wear, the SC brace was associated with increased curve progression in comparison with the Bb. There is also a trend for increased risk of requiring surgery when the SC brace is worn.",0

We enrolled 40 patients (27 men and 13 women, aged 44.2 +/- 11.6 years) who had received renal allograft at least 6 months before (time since transplant, 61.2 +/- 44.6 months). At baseline, parathyroid hormone (PTH) was elevated in 53% of the patients and the Z scores for bone alkaline phosphatase (b-ALP) and urinary type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide (u-NTX) were higher than expected (p < 0.001). T scores for the lumbar spine (-2.4 +/- 1.0), total femur (-2.0 +/- 0.7), and femoral neck (-2.2 +/- 0.6) were reduced (p < 0.001). After the first observation, patients were advised to adhere to a diet containing 980 mg of calcium daily and their clinical, biochemical, and densitometric parameters were reassessed 1 year later. During this period, bone density decreased at the spine (-2.6 +/- 5.7%;p < 0.01), total femur (-1.4 +/- 4.2%; p < 0.05), and femoral neck (-2.0 +/- 3.0%; p < 0.001). Then, the patients were randomized into two groups: (1) group A-10 mg/day of alendronate, 0.50 microg/day of calcitriol, and 500 mg/day of calcium carbonate; and (2) group B-0.50 microg/day of calcitriol and 500 mg/day of calcium carbonate. A further metabolic and densitometric reevaluation was performed after the 12-month treatment period. At the randomization time, group A and group B patients did not differ as to the main demographic and clinical variables. After treatment, bone turnover markers showed a nonsignificant fall in group B patients, while both b-ALP and u-NTX decreased significantly in alendronate-treated patients. Bone density of the spine (+5.0 +/- 4.4%), femoral neck (+4.5 +/- 4.9%), and total femur (+3.9 +/- 2.8%) increased significantly only in the alendronate-treated patients. However, no trend toward further bone loss was noticed in calcitriol and calcium only treated subjects. No drug-related major adverse effect was recorded in the two groups. We conclude that renal transplanted patients continue to loose bone even in the long-term after the graft. Alendronate normalizes bone turnover and increases bone density. The association of calcitriol to this therapy seems to be advantageous for better controlling the complex abnormalities of skeletal metabolism encountered in these subjects.",0

Accordingly, the objective of this study was to compare efficacy and safety between brand alendronate and a recently introduced generic alendronate drug.A total of 140 postmenopausal women or men aged older than 50 years who met the indications for osteoporosis treatment were randomized to receive either generic (Bonmax®) or brand alendronate (Fosamax®) 70 mg/week over a 12-month period during the May 2014 to June 2015 study period. Endpoints included bone mineral density (BMD) changes at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck; percentage of patients with predefined levels of change in total hip and lumbar spine BMD at 12 months; and, changes in biochemical bone markers at 3, 6, and 12 months. Tolerability was evaluated by patient self-reporting of adverse experiences.At 12 months post-treatment, BMD significantly increased at all sites in both groups. There were no differences in BMD percentage changes or the number of patients with stable or increased BMD after 1 year between groups. No significant differences in the amount of biochemical bone marker reduction or incidence of adverse events were observed between groups.Generic and brand alendronate produced similar gains in BMD and reduction in bone turnover markers. Both medicadoitions were also equally well-tolerated. Based on these findings, generic alendronate (Bonmax®) is a viable alternative to the original brand of alendronate.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02371252.",0

The most important causative factor is the use of corticosteroids, but persisting hyperparathyroidism and abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism play a role too. This study examines the effect of treatment with calcium and active vitamin D on the loss of BMD in the first 6 mo after RTx. A total of 111 renal transplant recipients (65 men, 46 women; age, 47 +/- 13 yr) were randomized to either treatment with active vitamin D (0.25 microg/d) plus calcium (1000 mg/d) (CaD group), or to no treatment (NoT group). Immunosuppressive therapy consisted of cyclosporine, prednisone, and mycophenolate mofetil. Laboratory parameters and BMD (lumbar spine and hip) were measured at 0, 1 (laboratory only), 3, and 6 mo after RTx. Lumbar BMD was nearly normal at the time of RTx. In both groups, a significant decrease in lumbar BMD was observed during the first 3 mo (CaD, -3.3 +/- 4.3%; P < 0.0001; NoT, -4.1 +/- 4.8%; P < 0.0001). Between the third day and sixth month, lumbar BMD slightly recovered in the CaD group, but it decreased further in the NoT group (total loss 0 to 6 mo: CaD, -2.6 +/- 5.0% [P < 0.001]; NoT, -5.0 +/- 4.7% [P < 0.0001]). As a result, the amount of bone loss at 6 mo was significantly lower in the CaD group (P = 0.02). Loss of BMD at the different femoral sites was also significantly reduced in the CaD group. Apart from a trend toward more frequent hypercalcemia in the CaD group, no clinical or biochemical differences existed between the groups. Treatment with a low dose of active vitamin D and calcium partially prevents bone loss at the lumbar spine and proximal femur during the first 6 mo after RTx.",0

Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are one of the most severely affected groups. We conducted a controlled, randomized, nonblinded trial of pamidronate (30 mg intravenously every 3 mo) with vitamin D (800 IU/d) and calcium (1 g/d) (n = 16) compared with vitamin D and calcium alone (n = 18, the control subjects) for 2 yr in 34 patients after lung transplant to improve bone mineral density (BMD). The treatment groups were similar in age, sex, baseline T-scores, renal function, hospitalization rates, immunosuppressant levels, change in lung function, and body mass index (BMI) over the study period. The patients treated with pamidronate gained 8.8 +/- 2.5% and 8.2 +/- 3.8% in spine and femur BMD after 2 yr in comparison to control subjects, who gained, on average (+/- SD), 2.6 +/- 3.2 and 0.3 +/- 2.2%, respectively (p </= 0.015 for both). Seven and six fractures occurred in the control and pamidronate groups, respectively (p > 0.2). Measures of bone resorption were highest immediately after lung transplant and improved with both pamidronate and time. Measures of bone formation were very poor after lung transplant, but recovered in the first post-lung transplant year irrespective of therapy. We conclude that pamidronate was more effective than control in improving bone mineral density after lung transplantation in patients with CF and appears to be one of the most promising agents studied to date for posttransplant osteoporosis.",0

Biomechanical studies and kinematic gait analysis were performed on very young children.A direct kinetic gait evaluation has never been performed, nor has the effect of pelvis dimorphism on the upper body been studied.Controlled experimental study.Outpatients were studied at the time of periodic follow up.Nineteen patients with bladder exstrophy, age 14±8 years, and twenty-five healthy control participants, age 15±8 years, were enrolled in the present gait analysis study.Clinical evaluation and standard gait analysis were performed.Gait analysis deviations between exstrophy patients and controls and between patients that received pelvic osteotomy (OT--6 patients) and those that did not (no-OT--13 patients) were analyzed. Bladder exstrophy significantly affects kinematics and kinetics of trunk, spine, pelvis, knee and foot; in particular: in OT, trunk retroversion, pelvic retroversion and rotation, hip adduction angle and moment, knee flexion and its maximum power during loading response increased, whereas in no-OT, spine angle, pelvic posterior tilt, hip extension, and the external rotation of the foot progression angle increased. All the kinetics parameters analyzed in the study showed lower values in the patient group than in controls.. Walking in patients with bladder exstrophy is accomplished by retroversion of the pelvis and deviations mainly in the spine angle in no-OT and in knee flexion in OT.Gait analysis was shown to be an effective tool for the detection of walking deviations that should be identified early, prompting rehabilitative treatment in order to prevent spine and knee diseases.",0

Secondary outcomes included femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD and serum C-telopeptide, a bone resorption marker.In the reference group, BMD declined at the spine and hip (P < 0.001). In the randomized groups, hip BMD remained stable. Spine BMD increased in the zoledronate group and did not change in the alendronate group; at 12 months, the 2.2% difference between groups (95% confidence interval, 0.6 to 3.9%; P = 0.009) favored zoledronate. In heart transplant patients, spine BMD declined in the alendronate and increased in the zoledronate group (-3.0 vs. +1.6%, respectively; between-group difference, 4.2%; 95% confidence interval, 2.1 to 6.3%; P < 0.001). In liver transplant patients, spine BMD increased comparably in both groups. Twelve-month C-telopeptide was lower in the zoledronate group than in the alendronate group (79 vs. 49%; P = 0.04).One 5-mg infusion of zoledronate and weekly alendronate prevent bone loss at the hip and, in liver transplant patients, increase spine BMD. In heart transplant patients, spine bone BMD remained stable with zoledronate but decreased with alendronate.",0

Theoretically, Airtraq an anatomically shaped blade with endotracheal tube guide channel offers advantage over Macintosh. We hypothesized that intubation would be easier and faster with Airtraq compared with Macintosh laryngoscope.Ninety anesthetized adult patients with normal airways were intubated by experienced anesthesiologists after cervical immobilization with MILS either with Macintosh or Airtraq. Primary outcomes compared were successful intubation, and degree of difficulty of intubation as assessed by Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS) score. Secondary outcomes compared were duration of laryngoscopy and intubation, degree of difficulty of intubation as assessed by Numerical Rating Scale score, soft tissue, and dental trauma.All 90 patients were successfully intubated in the first attempt. Intubation as assessed by IDS score was easier in Airtraq (84.44%) in contrast to slight difficulty in the Macintosh (77.78%) group; Numerical Rating Scale score was easy in both the groups (Airtraq-91.12%; Macintosh-93.34%). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) time for laryngoscopy, (12 s [IQR, 8 to 17.5) vs. 8 s [IQR, 6 to 12]); total duration for intubation (25 s [IQR, 20-33] vs. 22 s [IQR, 18-27.5]) were prolonged in Airtraq group in comparison to Macintosh group.In anesthetized adult patients with MILS compared with Macintosh, Airtraq provides equal success rate of intubation, statistically significant (although clinically insignificant) longer duration for laryngoscopy and intubation. Intubation with Airtraq was significantly easier than Macintosh as assessed by the IDS score.",0

In this study, we evaluated the impact of prone and jackknife position on intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), lung mechanics, blood loss at the surgical site, and duration of the surgical procedure on lumbar disc operations.Forty patients operated for single-space lumber disc herniation were included in our study. All patients were ASA I-II and 18 to 70 years old. Patients who had undergone previous spinal surgery, were on anticoagulant or anti-aggregant therapy, had hypertension, cardiac, respiratory, liver, or renal disorders, and were obese (Body Mass Index >35 kg/m²) were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to either the prone or the jackknife position for surgery. Differences in lung mechanics, IAP, and surgical-site blood loss were calculated in both patient groups. Changes in pulmonary and abdominal pressure levels were measured both in face-up and down positions.Bleeding at the surgical site (prone: 180.0±100.0 mL, jackknife: 100.0±63.6 mL, P=0.018) and IAP (prone: 11.0±3.0 mm Hg, jackknife: 8.0±2.0 mm Hg, P=0.006) were significantly reduced when patients were in the jackknife position. Operating time was approximately 40 minutes shorter in the jackknife position group, although this difference was not significant.The jackknife position causes less IAP elevation and less surgical site bleeding compared with the prone position. The jackknife position is the preferred choice for single-level lumbar disc surgery in healthy, nonobese patients.",0
2309,https://openalex.org/W2414841535,,Application of a new combined model including radiological indicators to predict difficult airway in patients undergoing surgery for cervical spondylosis.,"Airway management is crucial in clinical anesthesia. Many complications associated with airway management result from unexpected difficult airway, but predicting a difficult airway is a major challenge. We investigated the efficacy of a new combined model including radiological indicators to predict difficult airway in patients undergoing surgery for cervical spondylosis, a population with a high incidence of difficult airway.We randomly enrolled 303 patients scheduled for elective surgery for cervical spondylosis at Peking University Third Hospital between August 2012 and March 2013. Preoperatively, patients were evaluated for difficult airway according to a clinical index and parameters on lateral cervical radiographs and magnetic resonance images. Difficult airway was defined as Cormack-Lehane grades III-IV. Logistic regression was used to identify a combined (clinical and radiological) model for difficult airway. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to describe the effectiveness of prediction.We identified three clinical predictive factors using the ROC curve: mouth opening, sternomental distance, and neck mobility. We created a clinical model using three factors: gender, age, and mouth opening, with odds ratios (OR) of 0.370, 1.034, and 0.358, respectively. Using the clinical and radiological parameters, we formulated a combined model with five risk factors: gender, mouth opening, atlanto-occipital gap, the angle from the second to sixth cervical vertebraes in the neutral position, and the angle difference of d (the angle between the laryngeal axis and the epiglottic axis) from the neutral position to extension (OR: 0.107, 0.355, 0.846, 1.057, and 0.952, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of the combined model were 80.0% and 65.7%, respectively, and the ROC curve confirmed that the combined model was better than any single clinical predictor and the clinical model.The efficacy of the combined model including both clinical and radiological indicators was better than any single clinical predictor or the clinical model in patients undergoing elective surgery for cervical spondylosis.",0

Baroreceptor unloading and the consequent sympathoexcitation, as during head up tilt, decreases pain threshold and arouses the central nervous system (CNS), whereas hypotension exerts a direct CNS depressant effect. We estimated the minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of desflurane for immobility in patients undergoing surgery in the sitting position, in comparison to MAC desflurane for patients having a similar type of surgery in the supine position.The Dixon up-and-down method was used to evaluate the MAC for desflurane in patients undergoing cervical spine laminoplasty (n = 24) or discectomy (n = 24) in the sitting and supine positions, respectively. Logistic regression with co-variate adjustment was employed to examine if the two positions (sitting and supine) have different or share the same concentration vs response relationship for immobility. Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the MAC in each position, and to estimate the difference in MAC (delta MAC) between the sitting and supine positions.Modeling both sitting [6.54% (6.50-6.66, 95% CI)] and supine [6.70 (6.55-6.81)] patients as having different MAC concentrations did not significantly improve our simplified model, which treats the two patient groups as one [6.61 (6.52-6.70), delta -2 log likelihood = 2.735, P = 0.098]. Mean delta MAC (95% CI) was -0.14 (-0.30, 0.03).The sitting position does not change desflurane anesthetic requirements for immobility.",0

However, concerns have been raised about the safety of vitamin D supplementation in PHPT.We aimed to assess safety and effects on calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism of supplementation with high doses of vitamin D in PHPT patients.This was an investigator-initiated double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial from a single center.Forty-six PHPT patients were recruited, with a mean age of 58 (range 29-77) years, and 35 (76%) were women.Intervention included daily supplementation with 70 μg (2800 IU) cholecalciferol or identical placebo for 52 weeks. Treatment was administered 26 weeks before PTX and continued for 26 weeks after PTX.PTH, calcium homeostasis, and bone metabolism were evaluated.Preoperatively, 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased from 50 to 94 nmol/L in the treatment group and decreased from 57 to 52 nmol/L in the placebo group (P < .001). Compared with placebo, vitamin D decreased PTH significantly by 17% before PTX (P = .01), increased lumbar spine bone mineral density by 2.5% (P = .01), and decreased C-terminal β-CrossLaps by 22% (P < .005). The trabecular bone score did not change in response to treatment, but improved after PTX. Postoperatively, PTH remained lower in the cholecalciferol group compared with the placebo group (P = .04). Plasma creatinine and plasma and urinary calcium did not differ between groups.Daily supplementation with a high vitamin D dose safely improves vitamin D status and decreases PTH in PHPT patients. The vitamin D treatment is accompanied by reduced bone resorption and improved bone mineral density before operation.",0

However, cervical collar immobilization is more commonly performed in the prehospital environment, and its early removal is necessary before intubation. We hypothesized that if usability of Airway Scope (AWS) in a difficult airway could also bring merits to intubation under cervical collar immobilization, unnecessary risk caused by the removal of a neck collar may be prevented.In this crossover study, 30 consenting patients presenting for surgery were assigned to undergo intubation using AWS. Neck was stabilized manually and by a neck collar in a random order before laryngoscopy was performed by the same anesthesiologist. Measurements include interincisor distance (IID), success rate, intubation time, and fluoroscopic examination of the upper and middle cervical spine.IID was notably narrower after application of a neck collar (mean ± SE: MIS, 19 mm ± 1 mm; collar, 10 mm ± 1 mm; p < 0.01). One and 9 failures were encountered in MIS and collar groups, respectively (p = 0.012). Intubation time proved no statistical significance. Extension of craniocervical junction was observed in both groups, but occipitoatlantal joint was significantly more extended in collar group (median [range]: AWS, 10-degree angle [-1 to 20-degree angle]; collar, 14-degree angle [5 to 26-degree angle]; p < 0.01).AWS laryngoscopy under cervical collar immobilization fails to meet our expectation. Intubation failed in 30% of the cases in collar group whereas only 3.3% of the cases in MIS group. Significant difference of mouth opening limitation is probably the major reason, as 7 of 9 failed cases in collar group had IID <10 mm. This was insufficient to insert the 18-mm blade of AWS. In addition, occipitoatlantal joint suffered a greater extension when wearing a neck collar. Differences in the method to stabilize the neck may be the reason.When compared with cervical collar immobilization, AWS laryngoscopy along with MIS seems to be a safer and more definite method to secure airway of neck-injured trauma patients because it limits less mouth opening and upper cervical spine movement.",0

Group D received dexmedetomidine 0.6 microg kg(-1) as bolus before induction and 0.2 microg kg(-1) h(-1) by infusion. Group F received fentanyl 1 microg kg(-1) as bolus before induction and 0.5 microg kg(-1) h(-1) by infusion. Signs of inadequate analgesia, defined as an increase in heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) 20% above the baseline, were managed by increasing or decreasing the dosage of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl. Statistical analysis was performed with student t, chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests.The maintenance dosage was 0.64+/-0.06 microg kg(-1) h(-1) for fentanyl in Group F and 0.31+/-0.08 microg kg(-1) h(-1) for dexmedetomidine in Group D. MAP values in Group D were significantly higher than in Group F only after intubation. Before and after extubation, MAP values in Group F were significantly higher than those in Group D. There was no statistical difference in heart rate between the groups. Propofol dosages for induction (1.40+/-0.48 mgkg(-1)) and maintenance of anesthesia (2.03+/-0.41 mg kg(-1)) were lower with dexmedetomidine. Extubation time and postanesthesia care unit discharge time were similar in both groups. The fentanyl group patients required supplemental analgesia earlier than the dexmedetomidine group (34.8+/-1.35 min vs 60.4+/-1.04 min). Postoperative nausea and vomiting were significantly higher in Group F.In conclusion, propofol-dexmedetomidine is suitable for patients undergoing elective spinal laminectomy and provides stable perioperative hemodynamic responses. Propofol-fentanyl medication requires a higher dosage of postoperative analgesics and causes frequent postoperative nausea and vomiting compared with propofol-dexmedetomidine.",0

Ketamine is an N-methyl D-aspartate antagonist that blocks transmission of painful stimuli and could be a useful medication for this patient population. A new low-dose ketamine protocol as an adjunct to conventional pain therapy was implemented in a major urban Level 1 trauma center in Canada. A retrospective before-and-after chart review was conducted to explore the research question, ""What is the effect of low-dose ketamine continuous intravenous infusions on pain of highly opioid-tolerant adults following spinal surgery?"". All patients had spine surgery, used a minimum of 100 mg daily oral morphine equivalent preoperatively and were followed postoperatively by the hospital's Acute Pain Service. Data from individuals treated with conventional therapy during the year prior to protocol implementation were compared with data from patients who received conventional therapy plus ketamine post implementation. Outcome measures included pain scores and daily opioid consumption on postoperative days 0 through 5, time to ambulation, time to discharge, and adverse effects. There were no statistically significant differences between conventional therapy and conventional therapy plus ketamine. Ketamine may still be of benefit to patients with acute-on-chronic pain, although this was not evident in this study. Future research using more robust assessment tools to determine effectiveness of ketamine is required.",0

Postoperatively patient-controlled analgesia was provided with intravenous morphine. Morphine consumption was assessed during 24 H, and pain scores were measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) at rest and on mobilisation, during the first two postoperative days.In group KM, less i.v. morphine was administered in the post anaesthesia care unit than in group M (median [range]: 0mg [0-2] vs. 7 mg [6-9], P=0.009). Cumulative 24 H morphine consumption was reduced by 57% in group KM vs. group M, and by 48% in group KM vs. group K. Postoperative VAS scores were lower in group KM vs. groups K and M. Maximal VAS score on mobilization was reduced in group KM compared to groups K and M (38 mm [35-45] vs. 52 mm [48-59] and vs. 59 mm [55-64], in groups KM, K and M, respectively, P=0.05 and P=0.002). The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was decreased in group KM compared to group M (21.7% vs. 43.5%, P=0.001).Ketamine small-dose, combined with morphine improves postoperative analgesia and reduces opioid-related side effects in lumbar disk surgery.",0

After an identification of epidural space, 5 ml of normal saline with epinephrine (1:200 000) was injected into epidural space in group E and 5 ml of normal saline in group N through an epidural needle. The syringe plunger was pressed firmly for 20 seconds to ensure a sufficient diffusion. For both groups, the levels of mean arterial pressure and heart rates were recorded prior to anesthesia (T1), 2 min after switching into a supine horizontal position after successful puncture (T2), the time of fetal delivery (T3) and when surgery was over (T4). The cases with bloody fluid in epidural puncture needle during puncture or epidural catheter during catheter placement, fresh blood in epidural catheter and bloody fluid in caudal end of epidural catheter during extubation were recorded.All hemodynamic changes were within the normal ranges. There were no obvious inter-group differences (P > 0.05). No significant difference existed in the cases with bloody fluid in epidural needle during catheter insertion (10% vs 12%) or epidural catheter during catheter placement (4% vs 6%), fresh blood in epidural catheter (0% vs 0%) or bloody fluid in caudal end of epidural catheter during extubation (26% vs 30%) between the groups (P > 0.05).Preloading epidural space with epinephrine (1:200 000) may not lower the incidence of vascular injuries through the insertion of an epidural catheter during cesarean section.",0

The impact on BMD of surgical oophorectomy plus tamoxifen therapy has not been described. METHODS In 270 Filipino and Vietnamese premenopausal patients participating in a clinical trial assessing the impact of the timing in the menstrual cycle of adjuvant surgical oophorectomy on breast cancer outcomes, BMD was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck before this treatment, and at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgical and tamoxifen therapies. RESULTS In women with a pretreatment BMD assessment and at least 1 other subsequent BMD assessment, no significant change in femoral neck BMD was observed over the 2-year period (−0.006 g/cm2, −0.8%, P = .19), whereas in the lumbar spine, BMD fell by 0.045 g/cm2 (4.7%) in the first 12 months (P < .0001) and then began to stabilize. CONCLUSIONS Surgically induced menopause with tamoxifen treatment is associated with loss of BMD at a rate that lessens over 2 years in the lumbar spine and no significant change of BMD in the femoral neck.

Bivariate and multivariate analyses (generalized linear regression model, log transformed) were used to identify predictors of p-LOS. The model also estimated the effect of specific types of adverse effects and adverse-effect combinations on p-LOS. Mean ± SD p-LOS was 3.0 ± 2.1 days; median oral morphine equivalent postoperative dose was 60 mg/day. More than half of the patients (54.2%) experienced one or more adverse effects, 25.6% experienced two or more adverse effects, and 7.2% experienced three or more adverse effects. The composite of nausea and vomiting was experienced by 36.1% of study patients, and 12.6% had at least one emesis episode. Constipation and confusion were documented in 6.5% and 3.7% of patients, respectively. Constipation (p<0.0001), emesis (p<0.001), and confusion (p<0.01) were associated with increased p-LOS after adjusting for other significant variables. Patients with constipation had an adjusted 49% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25-77%) longer p-LOS (additional 1.4 days) compared with patients without constipation. Emesis and confusion significantly increased p-LOS by 25% (95% CI 10-42%) and 38% (95% CI 11-72%), respectively. Incremental increases in p-LOS for patients with two adverse effects (p=0.02), three adverse effects (p<0.001), and four adverse effects (p<0.001) versus patients with no adverse effects were 15%, 40%, and 82%, respectively.Constipation, emesis, and confusion were associated with increased p-LOS in patients receiving opioids after orthopedic surgery. In addition, there was a significant linear relationship between the number of adverse effects/patient and increased p-LOS, and the strength of the association increased as the number of adverse effects increased. Although the opioid dosages and adverse-effect rates were typical, these findings reinforce the need to balance pain management with risk of events.",0

There is a lack of consensus on the appropriate management of patients with or suspected of having a VFF.This work aimed at developing a comprehensive clinical care pathway (CCP) for VFF.The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was used to develop patient-specific recommendations for the various components of the CCP. The study included two individual rating rounds and two plenary discussion sessions.A multispecialty expert panel (orthopedic and neurosurgeons, interventional [neuro]radiologists and pain specialists) assessed the importance of 20 signs and symptoms for the suspicion of VFF, the relevance of 5 diagnostic procedures, the appropriateness of vertebral augmentation versus nonsurgical management for 576 clinical scenarios, and the adequacy of 6 aspects of follow-up care.The panel identified 10 signs and symptoms believed to be relatively specific for VFF. In patients suspected of VFF, advanced imaging was considered highly desirable, with MRI being the preferred diagnostic modality. Vertebral augmentation was considered appropriate in patients with positive findings on advanced imaging and in whom symptoms had worsened and in patients with 2 to 4 unfavorable conditions (eg, progression of height loss and severe impact on functioning), dependent on their relative weight. Time since fracture was considered less relevant for treatment choice. Follow-up should include evaluation of bone mineral density and treatment of osteoporosis.Using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, a multispecialty expert panel established a comprehensive CCP for the management of VFF. The CCP may be helpful to support decision-making in daily clinical practice and to improve quality of care.",0

Recently, there has been interest in pharmacologic agents, particularly Amicar and Aprotinin, to assist in decreasing perioperative blood loss. In 2001, in a preliminary study, we demonstrated that Amicar appeared to be effective in reducing perioperative blood loss in patients with idiopathic scoliosis undergoing a posterior spinal fusion and segmental spinal instrumentation. This was a study of 28 consecutive patients receiving Amicar compared to a historical control group of the 31 previous consecutive patients with the same study criteria. The current study was performed to confirm our preliminary findings.We analyzed the perioperative blood loss of 36 patients with idiopathic scoliosis who were blindly randomized by the operating room pharmacy into an Amicar and control group. The criteria to be included in the study was the same as the preliminary study: diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis, age at surgery 11 to 18 years, posterior spinal fusion and segmental spinal instrumentation only, autogenous iliac crest bone graft or homologous cancellous bone graft, and a signed agreement to participate in the study. The patients in both groups had the same anesthetic technique, intraoperative procedure, instrumentation, postoperative management, and standardized indications for transfusions.Before surgery, the patients in both groups were essentially identical. The distribution of patients and their results was not known until the completion of the study. Patients in the Amicar group demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in perioperative blood loss and the need for autologous blood transfusion. Interestingly, this decrease was predominantly in the postoperative suction drainage. This may be due to elevated fibrinogen levels induced by Amicar. The patients taking Amicar had no intraoperative or postoperative thromboembolic complications.The results of this study confirmed that the use of intraoperative Amicar is a safe, effective, and inexpensive method to significantly reduce perioperative blood loss in patients with idiopathic scoliosis undergoing posterior spinal fusion and segmental spinal instrumentation. The results have allowed us to reduce our recommendation for perioperative autologous blood donation, thereby further decreasing costs.",0

Many studies have demonstrated the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results in evaluating structural pathology in the lumbar spine, but few have addressed how frequently MRI findings change clinical management. A randomized controlled trial showed that viewing MRI results did not impact outcomes in patients with radiculopathy undergoing epidural steroid injection (ESI). The results suggested ESIs that correlated with both imaging and clinical findings experienced slightly more benefit than the blinded cohort, although statistically insignificantly.Three related studies were conducted to (1) increase understanding of the opinions of interventional spine physicians regarding the utility of viewing imaging before injection and (2) evaluate the impact of viewing MRI results on injection planning (retrospective and prospective analyses).Survey, prospective, and retrospective analysis.Patients presenting to a university-based spine center for initial evaluation of back or leg pain who were candidates for spinal intervention.Self-reported measures from a clinical practice questionnaire distributed to interventional spine physicians to determine rates and rationale for utilization of MRI before spine injection, physiologic measures including MRI results, functional measures including physician decision-making regarding type and location of injection performed.This study was funded by the University of Colorado Health and Welfare Trust. A survey was sent to interventional spine physicians to assess their utilization of MRI results before spine procedures. A retrospective analysis of patients who were candidates for ESI was conducted to evaluate how initial injection plan compared with the postviewing of MRI results on injection performed. In a prospective analysis, injection plans pre- and post-MRI were compared among patients presenting for initial evaluation of low back or leg pain.Survey responses showed that specialists order MRI studies to correlate with physical exam (91%) and to detect the presence of synovial cysts (68%), whereas tumor/infection (93%) was most likely to cause a change in their approach. In the retrospective review, the physician's planned approach before viewing the MRI was concordant with the actual procedure 49% of the time. A different type of procedure was performed in 15% of planned injections. In such cases, the initial treatment plan was altered (ie, same procedure at a different or additional level or side) in 35% of planned injections. In the prospective data collection, 43% of injections were different from the initial physician decision. The most common reasons for altering the injection was different level affected (36%), facet pathology (22%), and different nerve root affected (16%).In clinical practice, MRI before injection frequently changes management decisions in the planning and delivery of lumbar spine injections.",0

Since then, new methodologic evidence has emerged and standards have changed. Coupled with the upcoming revisions to the software and methods required by The Cochrane Collaboration, it was clear that revisions were needed to the existing guidelines.The Cochrane Back Review Group editorial and advisory boards met in June 2006 to review the relevant new methodologic evidence and determine how it should be incorporated. Based on the discussion, the guidelines were revised and circulated for comment. As sections of the new Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions were made available, the guidelines were checked for consistency. A working draft was made available to review authors in The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 3.The final recommendations are divided into 7 categories: objectives, literature search, inclusion criteria, risk of bias assessment, data extraction, data analysis, and updating your review. Each recommendation is classified into minimum criteria (mandatory) and further guidance (optional). Instead of recommending Levels of Evidence, this update adopts the GRADE approach to determine the overall quality of the evidence for important patient-centered outcomes across studies and includes a new section on updating reviews.Citations of previous versions of the method guidelines in published scientific articles (1997: 254 citations; 2003: 209 citations, searched February 10, 2009) suggest that others may find these guidelines useful to plan, conduct, or evaluate systematic reviews in the field of spinal disorders.",0

Measurements were performed at baseline and 90 minutes after performing the block. Cutaneous sensory block area was mapped and separated into a medial and lateral part by a vertical line through the anterior superior iliac spine. We measured muscle thickness of the 3 lateral abdominal muscle layers with ultrasound in the relaxed state and during maximal voluntary muscle contraction. The volunteers reported the duration of the sensory block and the abdominal muscle-relaxing effect.The lateral part of the cutaneous sensory block area was a median of 266 cm2 (interquartile range, 191-310 cm2) and the medial part 76 cm 2(interquartile range, 54-127 cm2).

We tested the hypothesis that, with the BIF compared to direct laryngoscopy, the rate of failed endotracheal intubation could be reduced in patients with a difficult airway, simulated by means of a rigid cervical immobilization collar.Seventy-six adults undergoing elective gynecological surgery under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to have endotracheal intubation, facilitated with either a standard size 3 Macintosh laryngoscope blade, or the BIF. A rigid cervical immobilization collar was used to simulate a difficult airway, by reducing mouth opening and limiting neck extension. If endotracheal intubation could not be achieved within two attempts, the cervical collar was removed, and direct laryngoscopy was performed thereafter, using a Macintosh blade in all subjects. The success rate of endotracheal tube placement was the primary outcome variable.Patient characteristics were similar in the two groups. After neck immobilization, the inter-incisor distance was reduced to 2.6 +/- 0.7 cm (Macintosh) and 2.6 +/- 0.8 cm (BIF). Tube placement was successful in 15/38 (39.5%) patients with a Macintosh blade, and in 31/38 patients with the BIF (81.6%; P = 0.0003).

MethodsPubMed was searched for the corresponding keywords from January 1, 1980, to August 1, 2017. A MEDLINE search was subsequently undertaken after applying MeSH filters. Appropriate cross-references were retrieved. Out of the 545 articles retrieved, 105 relevant papers that address the present topic were studied and the extracted content was circulated for further discussions. A draft position statement was compiled and circulated among the panel members via e-mail. The draft was modified by incorporating relevant suggestions to reach a consensus. Results and conclusionFor imaging cervical and thoracolumbar spine trauma patients, CT without contrast is generally considered to be the initial line of imaging and radiographs are required if CT is unavailable or unaffordable. CT screening in polytrauma cases is best done with a multidetector CT by utilizing the reformatted images obtained when scanning the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CT-CAP). MRI is indicated in cases with neurological involvement and advanced cervical degenerative changes and to determine the extent of soft tissue injury, i.e., disco-ligamentous injuries as well as epidural space compromise. MRI is also usually performed when X-rays and CT are unable to correlate with patient symptomatology. Graphic abstractThese slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

Reliability data were extracted and methodologic quality was evaluated by 2 independent reviewers.Of the 24 studies included, 6 were deemed to be of high methodologic quality. Among high quality studies, some reported the measurement error associated with performing repeated measurements of the same image (intraimage analysis), whereas others reported the reliability of obtaining and measuring unique RUSI images (interimage analysis). Intraimage measurements demonstrated good intrarater and interrater reliability (ICC: >0.93). Interimage measurements demonstrated good reliability between raters (ICC: >0.90). Interimage, intrarater correlation coefficients were more variable with ICC values ranging from 0.62 to 0.97.The methodologic quality of research investigating the reliability of RUSI to measure the abdominal and lumbar trunk muscles needs to be improved. The majority of results of high quality studies indicate that RUSI has good levels of rater reliability. Improved reliability was observed among studies examining muscle thickness, and when using mean measurement values obtained by more experienced examiners.",0

The use of continuous epidural analgesia through one or two epidural catheters placed intraoperatively by the surgeon has been shown to provide efficient postoperative pain control. In this prospective unblinded study, the authors compared the efficacy of continuous intravenous morphine with a continuous double epidural catheter technique with ropivacaine after scoliosis correction. Methods Thirty patients with American Society of Anesthesiology physical status I-III were prospectively randomized to either the morphine group or the epidural group. At the end of surgery, patients in the epidural group received two epidural catheters placed by the surgeon, one directed cephalad and one caudally. Correct placement was checked radiographically. Postoperative analgesia until the first postoperative morning was performed with remifentanil target-control infusion for all patients. From that time remifentanil was stopped and continuous intravenous analgesia with morphine or double epidural analgesia with ropivacaine 0.3% was initiated (T0 = beginning of study). Pain at rest and pain in motion (using a visual analog scale from 0-100), the amount of rescue analgesics, sensory level, motor blockade, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and pruritus were assessed every 6 h and bowel function was assessed every 12 h until T72 (end of study). Two days later, patient satisfaction was assessed. Results Pain scores at rest were significantly decreased in the epidural group at all time points except at T12, T60, and T72. Pain scores in motion were significantly decreased in the epidural group at T24, T48, and T72. Bowel activity was significantly better in the epidural group at T24, T36, T48, and T60. Postoperative nausea and vomiting and pruritus occurred significantly less frequently in the epidural group. No complications related to the epidural catheter occurred. Conclusions Both methods provide efficient postoperative analgesia. However, double epidural catheter technique provides better postoperative analgesia, earlier recovery of bowel function, fewer side effects, and a higher patient satisfaction.",0

Thirty-one patients participated: 15 received deflazacort and 16 remained on methylprednisone. The study started at a mean of 2.1 years after transplantation, when patients were randomized to either continue with methylprednisone or switch to deflazacort. Height velocity increased more in the deflazacort than in the methylprednisone group only during the first 2 years: 5.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.5 +/- 0.3 cm/year, and 4.2 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.4 cm/year p=0.007, [by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. After 2 and 3 years, the number of patients who were overweight increased in the methylprednisone group and decreased in the deflazacort group; p<0.01. Lean body mass increased more in the deflazacort than in the methylprednisone group (p=0.003). Fat body mass increased only in the methylprednisone group (p<0.01). Total cholesterol and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increased in the methylprednisone group (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). Total and LDL cholesterol were reduced (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively), whereas high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased (p<0.001) during deflazacort therapy. Lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) decreased in both groups, but total skeleton BMD decreased only in the methylprednisone group (p<0.001). Finally, normal glucose/insulin ratio, defined as > 7, was associated (p<0.05) with the deflazacort group. Our data suggest that deflazacort therapy might improve linear growth and lean body mass and prevent excessive bone loss and fat accumulation. It also leads to an improvement in lipoprotein profile without reduction in insulin sensitivity.",0

This study examined the efficacy of treatment with calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) in preventing bone loss in patients undergoing cardiac or lung transplantation. In this 2-year double-blind, stratified study, 65 patients undergoing cardiac or single lung transplantation were randomly allocated to receive either placebo or calcitriol (0.5-0.75 microg/day), the latter for either 12 months or 24 months. All patients received 600 mg calcium/day. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured every 6 months for 2 years by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. There was no significant difference between groups with respect to age or cumulative dose of prednis(ol)one or cyclosporine over the 2 years. Bone loss at the proximal femur was significantly reduced or prevented at all three sites by treatment with calcitriol for 2 years compared with treatment with calcium alone. Treatment with calcitriol for 12 months followed by calcium for 12 months resulted in similar proximal femoral bone loss to that seen in those patients treated with calcium for 24 months, suggesting calcitriol prophylaxis needs to be continued beyond 12 months. At the lumbar spine, there were no significant differences in BMD between groups. Over a period of 2 years, 22 new vertebral fractures/deformities occurred in 4 patients treated with calcium alone compared with one new vertebral fracture in 1 patient treated with calcitriol. Because the sample size was too low to provide reliable interpretation of vertebral fracture rates, this difference is likely a chance result. Mild hypercalcemia was common with calcitriol therapy, as was mild hypercalciuria (59% of patients vs. 10% controls), but there were no significant differences between groups in serum creatinine after 2 years. These data suggest calcitriol has a role in reducing proximal femur bone loss after cardiac or lung transplantation but treatment needs to be continued beyond 1 year.",0

The following aspects of the FAM were assessed at preoperative baseline and after 10 postoperative weeks: numeric pain rating scale (0-10) for leg and back pain intensity separately, Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODI), and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Multivariate regression models were used to examine the best combination of baseline FAM variables to predict the 10-week leg pain, back pain, and disability. All multivariate models were adjusted for age and sex.60 patients (30 females, mean [SD] age = 40.4 [9.5]) were enrolled. All FAM measures correlated with disability at baseline. Adding FAM variables to each of the stepwise multiple linear regression model explained a significant amount of the variance in disability (Adj. R2 = .38, p < .001), leg pain intensity (Adj. R2 = .25, p = .001), and back pain intensity Adj. R2 = .32, p < .001 at 10-weeks). After adjusting for age and gender, BDI and FABQ-work subscale were the only significant predictors added to each of the prediction models for the 10-week clinical outcome (leg pain, back pain, and ODI).BDI and FABQ-work subscale variables are associated with baseline pain intensity and disability and predict short-term pain and disability following lumbar disc surgery. Measuring these variables in patients being considered for lumbar disc surgery may improve patient outcome.",0

In the CG, excision of T2 and T3 ganglia was performed, whereas in the SG only separation of the sympathetic chain was performed at the same level. Patients underwent respiratory and cardiovascular exercise tests before, at 2 weeks and again at 6 months after the procedure. The postoperative values were then compared with the preoperative values to assess the statistical difference.Twenty-one patients in each group completed the study. In the SG, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1; P < 0.01) and forced vital capacity (FVC; P < 0.01) were significantly reduced at 2 weeks, but returned to similar baseline values 6 months after the procedure. No significant cardiac changes were observed. In the CG, both FEV 1 and FVC were significantly reduced at 2 weeks (P < 0.01) and at 6 months after operation (P < 0.05). A significant reduction in forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of vital capacity (P < 0.01) and a relevant increase in airway resistance (P < 0.05) during the entire postoperative course were also observed. Heart rates at rest and at peak exercise were significantly reduced at 2 weeks (P < 0.01) and significantly decreased 6 months after the procedure (P < 0.05). No other changes were registered. The cardio-respiratory alterations remained at a sub-clinical level; all patients completed the exercise test without symptoms.Sympathectomy may result in a disturbance of bronchomotor tone and cardiac function. Such changes remained at a sub-clinical level and seemed directly correlated with the extension of denervation.",0

The purpose of this study was to determine the therapeutic efficacy of a 6-month program of specific resistance exercise designed to reverse glucocorticoid-induced vertebral osteoporosis.Sixteen lung transplant candidates were randomly and prospectively assigned to a group (n=8) that performed 6 months of exercise on a lumbar extensor machine or to a control group (n=8). Resistance exercise was initiated at 2 months after transplantation. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar vertebra (L2-3) was assessed using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometer (DXA). DXA scans were performed before and 2 months after transplantation and after 6 months of lumbar extensor training or control period.Lumbar BMD did not differ (P>0.05) between the two groups at study entry. Both the trained (0.63 to 0.54 g/cm2 of hydroxyapatite) and control groups (0.62 to 0.53 g/cm2 of hydroxyapatite) lost significant and comparable amounts (-14.5%) of BMD between study entry and 2 months posttransplantation. The control group lost further (P<or=0.05) lumbar BMD between 2 and 8 months posttransplantation (0.53 to 0.50 g/cm2 of hydroxyapatite), decreasing to values that were 19.5% less than pretransplantation baseline. Lumbar BMD in the trained group increased significantly (+9.2%) after 6 months (0.54 to 0.60 g/cm2 of hydroxyapatite) and returned to values that were within 5% of pretransplantation baseline.Mechanical loading associated with progressive resistance exercise, using a specific exercise that isolated the lumbar spine, was efficacious in preventing steroid-induced osteoporosis in LTR.",0

Subcutaneous tunnelling of caudally placed epidural catheters is one such improvization to prevent the soiling of the catheter by urine and faeces. This study compares the duration of retention of catheter in a group with tunnelled catheters with an untunnelled group.

Some studies suggest that high baseline expectations per se yield better outcomes, others maintain that the fulfillment of prior expectations is paramount, and still others assert that it is the actual improvement in symptom status that governs outcome, regardless of prior expectations.Hundred patients took part (33 F, 67 M; mean [SD] age, 65 [11] yrs). Before surgery, they completed a booklet containing the Roland-Morris (RM) disability questionnaire, 0-10 pain graphic rating scales (back and leg separately), and Likert-scales about the degree of improvement expected in various domains. Two and 12 months after surgery, questions were answered regarding the perceived improvement for each of these domains, the RM and pain scales were completed again, and the patients rated the global outcome on a 5-point Likert-scale.Compared with the actual improvement recorded at 12 months, prior expectations had been overly optimistic in about 40% patients for the domains leg pain, back pain, walking capacity, social life, mental well-being, and independence, and in 50% patients for everyday activities and sport. There was no significant relationship between baseline expectations and follow-up scores for back pain, leg pain, RM-disability (corrected for baseline values), or global outcome. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that ""expectations being fulfilled"" was the most significant predictor of global outcome.In this patient group, expectations of surgery were overly optimistic. Having one's expectations fulfilled was most important for a good outcome. The results emphasize the importance of assessing patient-orientated outcome in routine practice, and the factors that might influence it, such that realistic expectations can be established for patients before surgery.",0

One hundred and eight patients scheduled for elective endoscopic urological procedures were enrolled in this prospective randomized study. They were assigned to perform loss of resistance epidural technique by either the conventional saline-filled syringe (group C) or the new pressure technique (group P). The latter depends on observing passage of free flow of pressurized normal saline (50 mmHg) connected to epidural needle during its advancement, and then the epidural catheter was inserted to ""float"" easily while saline was flowing. Ten ml of bupivacaine 0.5 % with 50 ?g fentanyl were injected. Time to identify epidural space, number of attempts, ease of catheterization, sensory and motor block by Bromage scale after 20 min, quality of anesthesia and any side effects were recorded. Significant reduction was found in group P versus group C concerning time to identify epidural space [20 (6-40) vs. 60.5 (23-75) s with p = 0.001], number of attempts [1 (1-2) vs. 1 (1-4) with p = 0.02] and motor block [1 (0-3) vs. 2 (0-2) with p = 0.02], respectively. No significant difference in epidural catheterization, sensory block, quality of anesthesia and incidence of side effects.

The purpose of the present study was to report predictors for fusion and also to investigate the importance of radiological variables for the clinical outcome. Gender, age, smoking habits, disc height, segmental kyphosis and type of surgical procedure were used as independent (before surgery) variables in a multiple regression model. Male gender, one-level surgery and CP treatment were significant predictors of fusion and explained 14% of the variability of fusion status at follow-up. Number of levels operated on, however, did not influence the clinical outcome. Fifty-two per cent of the women and 17% of the men in the CIFC group, and 25% of the women and 8% of the men in the CP group, had pseudarthrosis. Although patients with a healed fusion had significantly less pain intensity than patients with pseudarthrosis, radiological variables explained only 4% of the variability of pain at follow-up. Apart from a significant correlation between preoperative kyphosis and neck disability index at follow-up, no significant correlation between either postoperative kyphosis or preoperative or postoperative disc height and clinical outcome was found. Neither degree of segmental kyphosis nor disc height was different between patients with healed fusion and pseudarthrosis. One can conclude that male gender and type of surgery were significant predictors for a healed fusion and that pseudarthrosis affected outcome. In contrast to the commonly held view based mainly on theoretical considerations, no effect on clinical outcome could be demonstrated for segmental kyphosis and disc height at follow-up. Overall, the study shows that the importance of radiological factors as predictors for fusion as well as clinical outcome is limited.",0

Vertebral kinematics were tracked optically using indwelling bone pins; the motion segment was removed and mounted in a parallel robot equipped with a six-axis load cell. Movements of each SMT application at each site were replayed by the robot with the intact specimen and following the sequential removal of spinal ligaments, FJs and IVD. Forces induced by SMT were recorded, and specific axes were analyzed using linear mixed models.Analyses yielded a significant difference (p<.05) in spinal structures loads as a function of the application site. Spinal manipulative therapy application at the L3 vertebra caused vertebral movements and forces between L3 and L4 spinal segment in the opposite direction to when SMT was applied at L4 vertebra. Additionally, SMT applications over the soft tissue between adjacent vertebrae significantly decreased spinal structure loads.Applying SMT with a constant force at different spinal levels creates different relative kinetics of the spinal segments and load spinal tissues in significantly different magnitudes.",0

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has potential advantages for this task in that it allows imaging in arbitrary scan planes at high spatial resolution. However, several hurdles have to be overcome to make this approach practical, including resolution of issues related to nonlinear receive coil sensitivity, variations in marrow composition, and the presence of periosteal isointense tissues, which all complicate segmentation. The aim of this study is to develop MR acquisition and analysis methods optimized for the detection of cortical boundaries in such complex geometries as the femoral neck.Cortical boundary detection is achieved by radially tracing intensity profiles that intersect the periosteal and endosteal boundaries of bone. Profiles subsequently are normalized to the intensity of the marrow signal, processed with morphologic image operators, and binarized. The resulting boundaries are mapped back onto the spatial image, and erroneous boundary points are removed. From the detected cortical boundaries, cortical cross-sectional area and thickness are computed. The method was evaluated on cortical bone specimens and human volunteers on the basis of high-resolution images acquired at a 1.5-Tesla field strength. To assess whether the method is sensitive to detect the expected dependencies of cortical parameters in weight-bearing bone on overall habitus, 10 women aged 46-73 years (mean age, 56 years) underwent the cortical imaging protocol in the proximal femur, and results were compared with DXA bone mineral density parameters of the hip and spine.Reproducibility was approximately 2%. Double oblique images of the femoral neck in the 10 women studied showed that cortical cross-sectional area correlated strongly with height (r = 0.88; p = .0008), whereas cortical diameter versus age approached significance (r = 0.61; p = .06). Measurements in specimens of some cortical parameters indicated resolution dependence. However, note that specimen ranking within each parameter remained constant across all resolutions studied.Data suggest the new method to be robust and applicable on standard clinical MR scanners at arbitrary anatomic locations to yield clinically meaningful quantitative results.",0

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of anesthetic techniques on perioperative mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing cervical surgery.  From January 2008 to December 2015, 356 patients who underwent 1-level ACDF for cervical spinal myelopathy were prospectively reviewed. They were assigned to receive GA (group A) and CPA (group B). The analgesic efficacy of the block was assessed by anesthesia preparation time, the maximum heart rate, and mean arterial blood pressure changes compared with the baseline, time of postoperative revival, and duration of recovery stay. Duration of surgery, blood loss, and anesthesia medical cost were also recorded. Numerical rating scale (NRS) was used to evaluate pain at different time points. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was assessed, and postoperative average administered dosages of meperidine and metoclopramide were also recorded. The spinal surgeon satisfaction, anesthetist satisfaction, and patient satisfaction were assessed.  Both the anesthesia induction time and postoperative revival time were longer in group A than that in group B; both the duration of surgery and recovery stay were also longer in group A than that in group B, whereas there was no difference in blood loss between the 2 groups. The average dosage of both meperidine and metoclopramide was more in group A than that in group B, and the anesthesia medical cost was greater in group A than that in group B. There were no significant differences in baseline data of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate between the 2 groups. But the intraoperative data of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were higher/larger in group B than that in group A. In group A, there was no complaint of pain in the surgery procedure, but the pain increased after GA, with highest degree at 8 hours postoperation; then the pain degree decreased, and the NRS was 1 at 24 hours postoperation. In group B, intraoperative pain was NRS 4, and pain degree decreased from 4 hours postoperation; the NRS was 2 at 24 hours postoperation. The incidence of severe PONV was higher in group A than that in group B. There was no significant difference in the spinal surgeon satisfaction and anesthetist satisfaction for the anesthetic techniques. There was significant difference in patient satisfaction between the 2 groups, with high satisfaction for GA.  General anesthesia is superior to CPA in maintaining better intraoperative hemodynamic stability and providing high patient satisfaction with no intraoperative pain for patients receiving ACDF, but it entails longer surgery and anesthesia time, and requires more postoperative analgesic and anesthesia cost.",0

The Aarhus Spinal Metastases Algorithm (ASMA) was established to help surgeons choose the most appropriate surgical intervention for patients with spinal metastases.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of stratified surgical interventions based on the ASMA, which combines life expectancy and the anatomical classification of patients with spinal metastases to inform surgical decision making.This is a retrospective study based on a prospective database.A consecutive series of 515 spinal metastatic patients who underwent surgically treatment from December 1992 to June 2012 in Aarhus University Hospital were included prospectively and analyzed in detail retrospectively.Survival time after surgery was determined for all patients. Neurological function was assessed using the Frankel score preoperatively and postoperatively (at the time of discharge). Complete outcome data were retrieved in 97.5% of this cohort.Patients with spinal metastases were identified from an institutional database that prospectively collected data since 1992. Survival status data were obtained from a national registry. Neurological function was determined from the same institutional database or local Electronic Patient Journal system. Surgeons evaluated and classified patients into five surgical groups preoperatively by using the revised Tokuhashi score (TS) and the Tomita anatomical classification (TC).The overall median survival time of the cohort was 6.8 (95% confidence interval: 6.1-7.9) months. The median survival times in the five surgical groups determined by the ASMA were 2.1 (TS 0-4, TC 1-7), 5.1 (TS 5-8, TC 1-7), 12.1 (TS 9-11, TC 1-7 or TS 12-15, TC 7), 26.0 (TS 12-15, TC 4-6), and 36.0 (TS 12-15, TC 1-3) months. The 30-day mortality rate was 7.5%. Postoperative neurological function was maintained or improved in 469 patients (92.3%). Overall reoperation rate was 13.5%, commonly because of postoperative hematoma and new limb weakness.The ASMA recommends at least two surgical options for a particular patient by determining the preoperative life expectancy and anatomical classification of the spinal metastases. This algorithm could help spine surgeons to discriminate the risks of surgeries. The ASMA provides a tool to guild surgeons to evaluate the spinal metastases patients, select potential optimal surgery, and avoid life-threatening risks.",0

The authors investigated whether thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) as an adjunct to general anesthesia (GA) can increase the blood flow of the ITA.A prospective randomized study.A university hospital.Patients with ischemic heart disease.Thirty patients scheduled for elective CABG surgery were randomized to receive either GA (n = 15) or GA + TEA (n = 15) after receiving institutional review board approval. Demographics showed similarity between the groups. The epidural catheter was inserted in the thoracic region between T1 and T5 levels. In the GA + TEA group, the patients received a 20-mg bolus of 0.25% bupivacaine through epidural catheters 1 hour before surgery, and this was followed by the infusion (20 mg/h) of 0.25% bupivacaine. In all patients, ITA free blood flow was measured before cardiopulmonary bypass and without the administration of any vasodilatory agent. A short segment of ITA was excised for histologic examination; immunocytochemistry analysis was performed using antirabbit polyclonal VEGF antibody, rabbit polyclonal inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS) antibody, and adenosine anti-A2B receptor antibody. The immunoreactivity rates then were evaluated.The mean ITA free flow in the GA + TEA group was significantly higher than in the GA group (56.0 ± 9.0 mL/min v 39.6 ± 14 mL/min, p = 0.001). Immunostaining intensity in the sections after incubation with each primary antibody increased in the GA + TEA group compared with the GA group.The results of this study indicated that TEA increased ITA free blood flow significantly via increased VEGF, i-NOS, and adenosine-A2B receptor expressions. Therefore, the use of TEA as an adjunct to GA might be considered as an alternative to vasoactive agents for increasing ITA flow in CABG surgery.",0

One potential indication is to avoid or delay surgery, yet little information exists regarding surgery rates after ESI.The purpose of this research was to determine the proportion of patients having surgery after lumbar ESI for disc herniation or stenosis and to identify the timing and factors associated with this progression.This study was a retrospective review of nationally representative administrative claims data from the Truven Health MarketScan databases from 2007 to 2014.The study cohort was comprised of 179,025 patients (54±15 years, 48% women) having lumbar ESIs for diagnoses of stenosis and/or herniation.The primary outcome measure was the time from ESI to surgery.Inclusion criteria were ESI for stenosis and/or herniation, age ≥18 years, and health plan enrollment for 1 year before ESI to screen for exclusions. Patients were followed longitudinally until they progressed to surgery or had a lapse in enrollment, at which time they were censored. Rates of surgery were assessed with the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Demographic and treatment factors associated with surgery were assessed with multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. No external funding was procured for this research and the authors' conflicts of interest are not pertinent to the present work.Within 6 months, 12.5% of ESI patients underwent lumbar surgery. By 1 year, 16.9% had surgery, and by 5 years, 26.1% had surgery. Patients with herniation had surgery at rates of up to five-fold to seven-fold higher, with the highest rates of surgery in younger patients and those with both herniation and stenosis. Other concomitant spine diagnoses, male sex, previous tobacco use, and residence a rural areas or regions other than the Northeastern United States were associated with higher surgery rates. Medical comorbidities (previous treatment for drug use, congestive heart failure, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypercholesterolemia, and other cardiac complications) were associated with lower surgery rates.In the long term, more than one out of every four patients undergoing ESI for lumbar herniation or stenosis subsequently had surgery, and nearly one of six had surgery within the first year. After adjusting for other patient demographics and comorbidities, patients with herniation were more likely have surgery than those with stenosis. The improved understanding of the progression from lumbar ESI to surgery will help to better inform discussions regarding the value of ESI and aid in the shared decision-making process.",0

Few studies showed the superiority of the Airtraq comparing to Macintosh laryngoscope in the setting of difficult intubation.To compare the performance of these two laryngoscopes by simulating a situation of reduced mobility of the cervical spine by applying the Manual in-line stablization (MILS) maneuver.After obtaining the approval of the ethic committee, we realized a prospective single blind randomized study. During a 6-month period, 120 consenting patients scheduled for ORL or ophthalmologic surgery were included. They all had general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation. These patients were randomly and equally divided in two groups (n=60), depending on the type of the laryngoscope used (Airtraq or Macintosh). Were excluded from the study the patients with history or criteria predicting difficult intubation. Each patient was intubated by one of the five experimented anesthetists selected for this work. The principle judgment criteria were: i) the time taken for the orotracheal intubation and ii) the intubation difficulty score (IDS). The secondary judgment criterion was the hemodynamic modifications after the endotracheal intubation.Demographic and upper airway track variables were comparable between the two groups. There was no case of failure of intubation in this serie. Nonetheless, all the patients of the Airtaq group were intubated from the first attempt, whereas half of the patients of the Macintosh group were intubated after the third attempt. Comparing to the Macintosh, the Airtraq reduces the time taken for the orotracheal intubation (14±1s vs 19±3s, P=0.01), the necessity of additional maneuver to facilitate the intubation, and the intubation difficulty score (0.7±0.3 vs 3.8±1, P<0.001). Orotracheal intubation using the Airtraq laryngoscope caused less hemodynamic stimulation than using the Macintosh.Our study showed the usefulness of the Airtraq laryngoscope for endotracheal intubation for patients presenting conditions of difficult intubation such as reduced mobility of the cervical spine.",0

Although MC etiology is uncertain, historical data suggest a linkage to an autoimmune response of bone marrow triggered by the nucleus pulposus (NP).The aim of this study was to test whether bone marrow has an autoimmune response to NP cells that is amplified by an inflammatory milieu and ultimately leads to MC development in vivo. We hypothesized that an inflammatory co-stimulus is required for bone marrow/NP crosstalk to stimulate MC.This is an in-vitro cell co-culture study plus in-vivo experiments in rat caudal vertebrae.In in-vitro study, bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNCs) and NP cells (NPCs) from rats were co-cultured with and without interleukin (IL)-1α stimulation. Cell viability (n=3) of BMNCs and NPCs and gene expression (n=7) were analyzed. In in-vivo study, proinflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and control disc nucleus surrogates (NP micromass pellets) were generated in vitro from rat NPCs and implanted into rat tail vertebrae, and the response was compared with sham surgery (n=12 each). Tissue changes were investigated with T1w and T2w MRI (7T), histology, and immunohistochemistry (tumor necrosis factor, CD3) 1 (n=6) and 2 weeks (n=6) after implantation.BMNC/NPC co-culture significantly increased lymphocyte viability (42%-69%, p<.05) and reduced NPC viability (96%-88%, p<.001), indicating immunogenicity of NPC. However, IL-1α was required to cause significant transcriptional upregulation of IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, and tropomyosin receptor kinase A. Therefore, an inflammatory activation is required to amplify the immune response. Immunogenicity of the NP was corroborated in vivo by CD3 cell accumulation around LPS and control disc surrogates at Day 7. However, only the LPS disc surrogate group demonstrated infiltration of CD3 cells at Day 14. Furthermore, end plate defects (p<.05, LPS: n=4/6, Ctrl: n=0/6, sham: n=0/6) and MC1-like MRI changes (T2w hyperintensity, p<.05) were only seen with LPS disc surrogates.NPCs are immunogenic but cannot trigger MC without an additional proinflammatory stimulus. Our data suggest that MC requires end plate defects that allow marrow/NPC co-mingling plus an adjacent inflammatory ""MC disc"" that can amplify the immune response.",0

Therefore, in this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, the extent of anaesthesia and pattern of spread of contrast medium following an epidural bolus injection, via either a Tuohy needle or an epidural catheter, were compared. The study had two parts. In the first, 59 of 79 patients scheduled for a lower extremity operation under epidural anaesthesia were randomly allocated to one of the two groups. Anaesthesia was achieved with an epidural injection of 10 to 15 ml (including a 3 ml test dose) of 0.75% ropivacaine and fentanyl 25 μg via either a Tuohy needle (Group N, n=31) or a catheter (Group C, n=28). The level of sensory anaesthesia was recorded. In the second part, the remaining 20 patients were randomized to initially receive 5 ml of contrast medium via either a Tuohy needle (Group NE, n=10) or a catheter (Group CE, n=10). The extent of spread was recorded radiologically. Unilateral or missed blocks and additional dose requirement were absent in Groups N and C. No differences were found in the extent of sensory anaesthesia or the spread of contrast medium. Twenty per cent of catheter tips lay outside the lateral margins of the vertebral bodies. We found that an epidural bolus injection, via either a Tuohy needle or a catheter, made no difference in regard to spread of local anaesthetic or contrast medium in the epidural space.",0

As many as 70% of cancer patients develop spinal metastases and ∼10% of all cancer patients are treated for metastatic spinal cord compression.We retrospectively analyzed 166 patients who underwent surgery for symptomatic spinal metastases in our department between 2005 and 2012. The evaluated factors were age, primary tumor aggressiveness (slow, moderate, rapid growing), spinal location (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral), operation type (posterior decompression, anterior or posterior instrumented procedure, and radical combined instrumented surgery), preoperative evaluation using the revised Tokuhashi scoring system (<9, 9-11, and 12-15), pre- and postoperative neurological status according to the Frankel score (A-C and D-E), and the site of the main spinal cord compression (anterior, posterior, or combined). Postoperative complication and recurrence rate were also monitored.The mean age of the patients was 62 ± 12 years. The median survival time after surgery was 16.0 months. Preoperative neurological status influenced survival time significantly; the median survival was 5.1 months in Frankel A-C and 28.2 months in Frankel D-E (P < 0.001). Improvement on the Frankel scale did not influence the survival time (P = 0.131). When the patients' age was <65 years this related to a significantly longer survival time (P = 0.046). The Tokuhashi score predicted patient's survival independently (P < 0.001). The other factors had no statistical significance.The most important factors influencing postoperative survival time of these patients with symptomatic spinal metastases was the preoperative neurological condition and the Tokuhashi scoring system, which together represents a useful tool for planning the extent of surgical treatment.",0

A paucity of information exists regarding the effects of different therapies to prevent and treat bone loss in the renal transplant recipients. We constructed a design to study the effect of different modalities of treatment on bone mass in our renal transplant children. Among 93 patients who underwent renal transplantation at the age of 17 yr or less and were subjected to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), we blindly randomized 60 patients who had osteopenia or osteoporosis (T-score = -1 by DEXA) in a prospective study. Their mean age at time of transplantation was 13.4 +/- 4.3 yr. The mean duration after transplantation was 48 +/- 34 months. The patients were classified randomly into four groups. Each group consisted of 15 patients: group 1 was the control group, group 2 received oral alfacalcidol 0.25 microg daily, group 3 received oral alendronate 5 mg daily, and group 4 received 200 IU/day nasal spray calcitonin. Parameters of bone turnover, calcium metabolism, and DEXA were measured before and after 12 months of treatment duration. The characteristics of all groups were comparable at the beginning of the study. At the lumber spine, bone mass density decreased from -2.4 to -2.8 in group 1, increased from -2.3 to -0.5 in group 2, from -2.3 to -1.9 in group 3, and from -2.3 to -1.0 in group 4. The four groups had similar patient profiles, serum creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, and deoxypyridinoline. This study confirmed the value of alfacalcidol and antiresorptive agents in the treatment of osteopenia and osteoporosis in young renal transplant recipients.These therapies were safe, tolerable, simple to administer and potentially applicable to other renal transplant patients.",0

Group 1 received 4 paravertebral injections on one side versus 1 injection on the contralateral side (23 patients), group 2 received 4 injections versus 2 injections (23 patients), and group 3 received 4 injections versus 3 injections (23 patients).Sixty-one patients were included in the final analysis, which resulted in 368 thoracic paravertebral injections. Overall, 97% of the patients had adequate loss of sensation within the targeted area at the side of 4 injections, compared with only 11% for the single injections. The average vertical spread of contrast was found to be significantly greater in the set of 4 injections, with mean (SD) 6.5 (2.01) dermatomes, compared with the single injection, with 3.0 (1.19) dermatomes (P < .05). The average vertical spread of contrast and complete absence of sensation were significantly greater in the set of 4 injections compared with the set of 2 and 3 injections (P < .05).The main finding of the present study was that multiple paravertebral injections resulted in more reliable radiographic and clinical distribution compared with a single-injection technique.",0

Lung and kidney doses are limited to 200 cGy to protect organs damaged by SSc. Kidney block proximity to the spinal cord was investigated, and guidelines were developed for acceptable lumbar area TBI dosing. Information about kidney size and the organ shifts from supine to standing positions were recorded using diagnostic ultrasound (US). Minimum distance between the kidney blocks (dkB) and the lumbar spine region dose was recorded, and in vivo dosimetry was performed at several locations to determine the radiation doses delivered.Eleven patients were treated at our center with an anteroposterior (AP)/posteroanterior (PA) TBI technique. A 10% to 20% dose inhomogeneity in the lumbar spine region was achieved with a minimum kidney block separation of 4 to 5 cm. The average lumbar spine dose was 179.6 ± 18.1 cGy, with an average dkB of 5.0 ± 1.0 cm. Kidney block shield design was accomplished using a combination of US and noncontrast computerized tomography (CT) or CT imaging alone. The renal US revealed a wide range of kidney displacement from upright to supine positions. Overall, the average in vivo dose for the kidney prescription point was 193.4 ± 5.1 cGy.The dose to the kidneys can be attenuated while maintaining a 10% to 20% dose inhomogeneity in the lumbar spine area. Kidneys were localized more accurately using both US and CT imaging. With this technique, renal function has been preserved, and the study continues to enroll patients.",0

Reimbursement fees served as unit costs for Germany and Switzerland. Average reimbursement fees were used to measure resource utilization in all countries. Quality of care was assessed in terms of the following unnecessary treatments and diagnoses: bed rest for more than 2 days; exercise therapy; scheduling of a radiograph or other imaging tests; and referral to another provider. Responses were weighted with the level of scientific evidence for overuse.Weighted-average overuse ranged from 18% in the Netherlands to 31% in Germany. In England, Germany, and Switzerland, at least a third of the resources used to treat back pain were wasted.There was considerable waste in treating acute back pain.

A 15-mL methylene blue solution was injected at the T10 level and then an additional 5-mL dye injection at L1 level. Fifty patients were included in the study. Patients in group 1 (n = 25) underwent PVB of 2 segments at the T10 and L1 vertebrae levels on the same side as the hernia, whereas patients in group 2 (n = 25) underwent PVB through 4 segments at T10, T11, T12, and L1 on the same side as the hernia. Perioperative propofol/remifentanil consumption, surgery start time, time to perform the block, duration of sensory block, postoperative visual analog scale scores, and complications were evaluated.Any passage down to the T12 level was not observed after injection at the T10 level and also only after additional 5-mL dye injection at the L1 level; the genitofemoral, ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves were stained with dye in cadavers. The times for block application were 5 mins (SD, 1 min) in group 1 and 16 mins (SD, 4 mins) in group 2 (P < 0.001). The surgery start time was 25 mins (SD, 3 mins) in group 1 and 27 mins (SD, 6 mins) in group 2 (P = 0.234). In both groups, propofol and remifentanil were used in similar quantities during the perioperative period. Use of paracetamol tablets was similar in both groups (P > 0.05). Whereas none of the patients in group 1 displayed motor block or contralateral spread, 2 patients in group 2 displayed contralateral spread, and motor block was observed in 1 patient. Twenty-three patients (92%) in group 1 and 24 patients (96%) in group 2 were satisfied with the method (P > 0.05).Two-segment PVB can be an alternative to 4-segment PVB in inguinal hernia surgeries.

Prompt assessment and early intervention of DFIs associated with SCI are crucial to optimize patient outcome; however, neurologic examination of patients with subaxial cervical injury is often difficult, as patients commonly present with reduced levels of consciousness. Therefore, it is important to establish potential associations between injury epidemiology and radiographic features, and neurologic involvement.The aims of this study were to describe the epidemiology and radiographic features of DFIs presenting to a major Australian tertiary hospital and to identify those factors predictive of SCI. The agreement and repeatability of radiographic measures of DFI severity were also investigated.This is a combined retrospective case-control and reliability-agreement study.Two hundred twenty-six patients (median age 40 years [interquartile range = 34]; 72.1% male) who presented with a DFI of the subaxial cervical spine between 2003 and 2013 were reviewed.The epidemiology and radiographic features of DFI, and risk factors for SCI were identified. Inter- and intraobserver agreement of radiographic measurements was evaluated.Medical records, radiographs, and computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans were examined, and the presence of SCI was evaluated. Radiographic images were analyzed by two consultant spinal surgeons, and the degree of vertebral translation, facet apposition, spinal canal occlusion, and spinal cord compression were documented. Multivariable logistic regression models identified epidemiology and radiographic features predictive of SCI. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) examined inter- and intraobserver agreement of radiographic measurements.The majority of patients (56.2%) sustained a unilateral (51.2%) or a bilateral facet (48.8%) dislocation. The C6-C7 vertebral level was most commonly involved (38.5%). Younger adults were over-represented among motor-vehicle accidents, whereas falls contributed to a majority of DFIs sustained by older adults. Greater vertebral translation, together with lower facet apposition, distinguished facet dislocation from subluxation. Dislocation, bilateral facet injury, reduced Glasgow Coma Scale, spinal canal occlusion, and spinal cord compression were predictive of neurologic deficit. Radiographic measurements demonstrated at least a ""moderate"" agreement (ICC>0.4), with most demonstrating an ""almost perfect"" reproducibility.This large-scale cohort investigation of DFIs in the cervical spine describes radiographic features that distinguish facet dislocation from subluxation, and associates highly reproducible anatomical and clinical indices to the occurrence of concomitant SCI.",0

We therefore determined the impact of TEA on anesthetic requirements, when a closed-loop controller was used allowing the automated coadministration of propofol-remifentanil guided solely by the Bispectral index.This single-center double-blind study enrolled patients scheduled for elective posterolateral thoracotomy using TEA. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a bolus followed by a continuous infusion of levobupivacaine 0.5% (levo group) or saline 0.9% solution (saline group). General anesthesia was performed by the same automated controller. Stroke volume optimization guided by an esophageal Doppler probe was performed before randomization. The primary outcome variable was the amount of remifentanil delivered by the automated controller between skin incision and closure. Major arterial hypotension was recorded. Data are presented as medians [interquartile range] or number (%) RESULTS:: Nineteen adult patients per group completed the study. At similar depth of anesthesia evaluated by the percentage of time with the Bispectral index in the range 40-60 (85 [77-88] vs 83 [72-87]; P = .39), patients with neuraxial block required less remifentanil (0.15 [0.10-0.20] vs 0.23 [0.14-0.25], µg·kg·min; P = .03) and propofol (4.3 [3.7-4.9] vs 5.7 [4.6-7.3] mg·kg·h; P = .005). Major arterial hypotension was similar in both groups (6 [32%] vs 5 [25%]; P = .46; levo versus saline group, respectively).Epidurally administered levobupivacaine allowed a decrease by one-third of remifentanil requirement.

Sixty-six consecutive continent patients with advanced prolapse were randomised into two groups: group A underwent sacropexy combined with a Burch colposuspension; no anti-incontinence procedure was performed in group B patients.Work-up included clinical assessment (Halfway System and International Continence Society [ICS] classification for prolapse and Ingelman Sunderberg scale for incontinence), the Urogenital Distress Inventory and Impact Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaires, urogynaecologic ultrasound scans, and complete urodynamic testing that included the urethral pressure profile and Valsalva leak point pressure with reduced prolapse. Check-ups were done at 3, 6, 12 mo postoperatively and then yearly. Mean follow-up time was 39.5 mo.The mean age (+/- standard deviation) was 62+/-9 yr. All patients presented with grade (G) 3-4 prolapse. Postoperative incontinence was present in 12 of the 34 patients in group A: 7 G1; 4 G2, and 1 G3. Postoperative incontinence was present in 3 of the 32 patients in group B: 2 G1, 1 G3. The frequency of postoperative incontinence was significantly greater in patients who had undergone colposuspension (p<0.05).These preliminary data cast doubt on whether colposuspension should be performed during sacropexy for severe urogenital prolapse as prophylaxis for postoperative incontinence because it seems to emerge as overtreatment. Incontinence developed ex novo in 35% of continent patients treated with colposuspension combined with sacropexy.",0

However, communication is sometimes suboptimal.The objective was to develop a question prompt list (QPL) for patients undergoing spine surgery (spinal neurosurgery-QPL, ""SN-QPL"") to encourage them to acquire information during the informed consent consultation (ICC) and assess patients' information needs.We conducted a prospective uncontrolled single center study in order to develop a QPL for patients undergoing spine surgery.Patients inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) planned spinal surgery, (2) age 18 to 80 years, (3) legal capacity, (4) ability to understand and respond to questionnaires, and (5) informed consent.We applied the following self-report measures: the developed preliminary QPL with regard to surgery topics and assessment of patients' information needs.First, we performed a literature review, patient interviews, and two expert rounds. Subsequently, we validated a preliminary SN-QPL including 37 items before and after ICC with regard to importance of items and fulfillment of information needs in 118 patients. A principal component analysis followed by varimax rotation revealed the final SN-QPL.For the final version of the SN-QPL, 27 items with following four reliable subscales were derived with satisfactory internal consistency: (1) scale SN-QPL-C, ""complications and possible postoperative deficits"" (n = 8 items, Cronbach α = 0.88); (2) scale SN-QPL-P, ""prognosis and follow-up"" (n = 8 items, Cronbach α = 0.86); (3) scale SN-QPL-I, ""preoperative inpatient stay and organizational issues"" (n = 5 items, Cronbach α = 0.75); and (4) scale SN-QPL-S: ""safety of the surgical procedure"" (with n = 6 items, Cronbach α = 0.84). The most unmet information needs were found in SN-QPL-P. The item with the greatest unmet information needs was ""How much professional experience does my surgeon have?""Our SN-QPL was well-accepted and perceived as helpful by patients awaiting spinal surgeries. It seems to address meaningful items and questions. It could therefore be useful in optimizing pre- and postoperative satisfaction. Further, our study identified many unaddressed questions warranting communication interventions.",0

Our primary aims were to compare LS in on-opioid and opioid-naïve spine surgery patients and to evaluate whether surgery affects LS during the first 3 weeks after surgery. METHODS: After informed consent 200 patients (99 on-opioid, 101 opioid-naïve; 112 male; aged 23-71 years) having elective spine surgery were enrolled. Their LS was evaluated using a four-item Life Satisfaction Scale (4-20, lower score more satisfied) and pain interference using Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)-questionnaire (0-10, lower score, less interference) before and 21 days after surgery. RESULTS: At baseline LS was lower in the ON-OPIOID-group, mean LS-score 10.6 (SD 3.9), than that in the OPIOID-NAÏVE-group, 9.3 (3.0) (p = .027). At 3 weeks after surgery LS had increased in both groups compared to baseline (p < .001). However, LS was still lower in the ON-OPIOID-group, 9.1 (3.7) than that in the OPIOID-NAÏVE-group, 7.6 (2.7) (p = .005). Patients with lower LS experienced more pain interference pre- and post-operatively (p < .001). At 3 weeks the pain interference had decreased in both groups, in the ON-OPIOID-group from mean BPI-score 5.1 (2.0) to 3.0 (2.0) (p < .001) and in the OPIOID-NAÏVE-group from 4.0 (2.1) to 2.4 (2.3) (p < .001), but BPI-score was still higher in the ON-OPIOID-group (p = .045). CONCLUSION: Life satisfaction increased and pain interference decreased in both groups after spine surgery. However, LS was lower and pain interference was more significant in on-opioid patients than that in opioid-naïve patients.",0

The ""optimal intravenous dose"" was defined as that providing minimal analgesic request, stable haemodynamic profile and a minimal sedation score during 12h after extubation. Eighty adult patients, ASA physical status I-II, undergoing lumbar hemilaminectomy for herniated disk (L(4)-L(5), L(5)-S(1)) were included in the study. All the patients were randomly assigned to one of four study groups (A, B, C, D), 20 patients each. The same standardized general anaesthesia was performed for each group. Thirty minutes before the end of surgery, group A, B and C patients received three different loading doses of intravenous clonidine (5 microg/kg, 3 microg/kg, 2 microg/kg respectively), followed by the same infusion of intravenous clonidine (0.3 microg/kg per hour). Group D patients received a bolus dose and a continuous infusion of NaCl 0.9%. In the recovery unit, postoperative pain was treated by a patient-controlled analgesia device, containing morphine. Pain relief was evaluated by the total morphine requirement during the postoperative period. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate and sedation were also noted during the first 12h postoperatively. Intravenous clonidine decreased morphine requirements in a dose-dependent manner. Group A, B, C and D patients requested 5 +/- 2, 11 +/- 3, 19 +/- 4 and 29 +/- 8 doses of morphine respectively. Clonidine also affected SBP in a dose-related manner. Group A, B and C patients had an SBP decrease respectively of 26 +/- 3%, 7 +/- 4% and 2 +/- 2% compared with basic values while, at the same time, in group D patients no SBP variation was registered. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that, when sedation and analgesic effect of clonidine is required, 3 microg/kg bolus dose followed by a continuous infusion of 0.3 microg/kg per hour has to be considered the optimal intravenous dose. The higher dose of intravenous clonidine (5 microg/kg) produced better analgesia but the degree of hypotension and sedation was more severe and longer lasting; it required ephedrine administration and careful monitoring of the patient. On the other hand, the bolus of intravenous clonidine 2 microg/kg (group C) was less effective in terms of pain relief but with similar side-effects to the 3 microg/kg dosage (group B).",0

Patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis within the first month after LT were randomized to receive RIS 35 mg/week plus calcium 1000 mg/day and vitamin D(3) 800 IU/day (n = 45) or calcium and vitamin D(3) at same dosages (n = 44). Primary endpoint was change in bone mineral density (BMD) 6 and 12 months after LT. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum β-CrossLaps (β-CTX) and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal peptide (P1NP) and fracture rate. Spine X-rays were obtained at baseline and after 12 months. There was no significant difference in BMD changes between both treatment groups at any sites; either at 6 or 12 months. Spine BMD increased in both groups at 12 months vs. baseline (P = 0.001). RIS patients had a significant increase in intertrochanteric BMD at 12 months (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). Serum β-CTX decreased in both groups (P < 0.01), with significant differences between groups at 3 months. No significant difference in vertebral fracture incidence was found. After 12 months, BMD improved at lumbar spine and did not change at hip in both groups. Significant differences between both groups were not found. Other factors (calcium and vitamin D replacement, early prednisone withdrawal) seem to have also positive effects in BMD.",0

There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.(1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 ± 2.1 versus 3.3 ± 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 ± 2.0 versus 3.3 ± 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 ± 1.8 versus 1.8 ± 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 ± 1.5 versus 1.5 ± 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).This prospective multicenter three-arm blind randomized controlled trial showed potentially improved pain control at 6 and 12 hours in the liposomal bupivacaine and intrathecal morphine groups compared with the ropivacaine group at the cost of much higher incidences of pruritus (itching) in the intrathecal morphine group. Based on these results, we prefer the use of PAI with liposomal bupivacaine as an alternative to spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine as a result of similar postoperative pain control and the potential for reducing adverse events.Level I, therapeutic study.",0

By concealed random allocation, 10 of the patients were given 10 mg/kg of methylprednisolone pre-operatively. The control patients received the same amount of saline. Samples of arterial blood and local blood from the surgical site were sampled and analysed for inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandin E2.RESULTSThere were significant increments in systemic levels of IL-6, IL-10 and sTNF-R1. Corticosteroids significantly reduced the increases of IL-6 and significantly increased the levels of IL-10 and sTNF-R1. Locally, the expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and sTNF-R1 were significantly increased in both groups post-operatively. Corticosteroids significantly increased the local expressions of IL-10 and sTNF-R1. There were significantly higher local than systemic levels of inflammatory mediators except for TNF-alpha.CONCLUSIONThis study shows that in traumatic injury there are generally higher local than systemic expressions of inflammatory mediators, and that the main anti-inflammatory effects of high-dose corticosteroids are suppression of systemic IL-6 and increased expressions of IL-10 and sTNF-R1, both systemically and locally.OBJECTIVEPlasma concentrations of inflammatory mediators are substantially increased in major orthopaedic surgery. It was our hypothesis that corticosteroids would reduce the post-operative levels of inflammatory mediators in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, and we performed a single-centre randomised controlled trial.",0

The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness and cost of patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with tramadol versus low dose tramadol-paracetamol on postoperative pain. A total of 60 patients were randomly divided into two groups. One group received 1.5 mg/kg tramadol (Group T) while the other group received 0.75 mg/kg tramadol plus 1 g of paracetamol (Group P) intravenously via a PCA device immediately after surgery and the patients were transferred to a recovery room, Tramadol was continuously infused at a rate of 0.5 mL/h in both groups, at a dose of 10 mg/mL in Group T and 5 mg/mL in Group P. The bolus and infusion programs were adjusted to administer a 1 mL bolus dose of tramadol with a lock time of 10 minutes. In Group P, 1 g of paracetamol was injected intravenously every 6 hours. The four-point nausea scale, numeric rating scale for pain assessment, Ramsey sedation scale, blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, peripheral oxygen saturation values and side effects were recorded at 0, 15 and 30 minutes, and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours. The time to reach an Aldrete score of 9 was also recorded. A cost analysis for both groups was performed. In Group P, the numeric rating scale scores were significantly lower than that in Group T at 0 and 15 minutes. The number of side effects, additional analgesic requirement and the total dose of tramadol were lower in Group P than in Group T. However, the total cost of postoperative analgesics was significantly higher in Group P than in Group T (p < 0.001). We conclude that PCA using tramadol-paracetamol could be used safely for postoperative pain relief after spinal vertebral surgery, although at a higher cost than with tramadol alone.",0

All patients were followed up for 1 year by measuring LSBMD, TBMD, serum calcium, inorganic phosphate, parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, serum alkaline phosphatase, intact osteocalcin, urinary pyridinoline (U(pyd)) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (U(dpd)). The presence of spinal fractures was evaluated by X-ray photography before and after treatment.EHDP treatment produced a significant increase in LSBMD of 10% compared with pretreatment levels after 1 year (p < 0.03, compared to baseline), while PTX produced a significant increase in LSBMD of 20% compared to pretreatment levels (p < 0.01). However, TBMD remained unchanged for 1 year after both EHDP administration and PTX. Among biochemical bone turnover markers, EHDP administration resulted in significant decreases in alkaline phosphatase by 78%, U(pyd) by 64% and U(dpd) by 37% after 12 months compared with the pretreatment levels (p < 0.05) and intact osteocalcin by 67% after 6 months (p < 0.05). There were no differences in the fracture rate between the EHDP and PTX groups during 1 year.EHDP administration results in a somewhat lower increase in LSBMD than that following PTX and suppresses bone formation and resorption in elderly PHPT patients for 1 year. We conclude that PTX is preferable to EHDP therapy for the management of elderly PHPT patients; however, EHDP administration should also be considered for elderly patients with many complications or who are unfit for surgery.",0

There are fewer reports comparing the effects of etomidate and propofol infusion on TceMEPs when used for the maintenance of anesthesia and guided by comparable values of bispectral index (BIS) during spinal surgery.Thirty-three patients scheduled for spinal surgery were randomly divided into 2 groups: propofol (PR, n=18) and etomidate (ER, n=15). Anesthesia was maintained with either propofol or etomidate combined with remifentanil. The infusion rates for propofol or etomidate were guided by the BIS value, which was maintained between 40 and 45. TceMEPs were conducted by stimulating needles placed at C1 and C2; recordings were made by measuring myogenic responses from the upper extremity abductor pollicis brevis muscles using needle electrodes. The threshold for eliciting a response, amplitudes, and latencies of TceMEPs, were recorded at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the induction of anesthesia. The cortisol levels were measured at 2 and 24 hours after induction.The voltage threshold needed to enlist TceMEPs in the ER group was significantly lower than that in the PR group (142±20 vs. 172±23 V, P=0.005). The amplitudes of TceMEPs were higher in the ER group than those in the PR group (P<0.05), whereas the latencies were shorter in the ER group than those in the PR group (P<0.05) at all study time points. Cortisol levels at all study time points were within the normal range.Etomidate has more favorable effects than propofol during the monitoring of TceMEPs under comparable BIS levels.",0

If equally good outcomes could be achieved with early ambulation and no brace, resource utilization would be decreased, especially in developing countries where prolonged bed rest is the default option because bracing is not available or affordable.To determine whether TLSO is equivalent to no orthosis (NO) in the treatment of acute AO Type A3 thoracolumbar burst fractures with respect to their functional outcome at 3 months.A multicentre, randomized, nonblinded equivalence trial involving three Canadian tertiary spine centers. Enrollment began in 2002 and 2-year follow-up was completed in 2011.Inclusion criteria included AO-A3 burst fractures between T11 and L3, skeletally mature and older than 60 years, 72 hours from their injury, kyphotic deformity lower than 35°, no neurologic deficit. One hundred ten patients were assessed for eligibility for the study; 14 patients were not recruited because they resided outside the country (3), refused participation (8), or were not consented before independent ambulation (3).Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire score (RMDQ) assessed at 3 months postinjury. The equivalence margin was set at δ=5 points.The NO group was encouraged to ambulate immediately with bending restrictions for 8 weeks. The TLSO group ambulated when the brace was available and weaned from the brace after 8 to 10 weeks. The following competitive grants supported this work: VHHSC Interdisciplinary Research Grant, Zimmer/University of British Columbia Research Fund, and Hip Hip Hooray Research Grant. Aspen Medical provided the TLSOs used in this study. The authors have no financial or personal relationships that could inappropriately influence this work.Forty-seven patients were enrolled into the TLSO group and 49 patients into the NO group. Forty-six participants per group were available for the primary outcome. The RMDQ score at 3 months postinjury was 6.8 ± 5.4 (standard deviation [SD]) for the TLSO group and 7.7 ± 6.0 (SD) in the NO group. The 95% confidence interval (-1.5 to 3.2) was within the predetermined margin of equivalence. Six patients required surgical stabilization, five of them before initial discharge.Treating these fractures using early ambulation without a brace avoids the cost and patient deconditioning associated with a brace and complications and costs associated with long-term bed rest if a TLSO or body cast is not available.",0

We wanted to compare post-operative opioid requirements in patients undergoing multilevel lumbar arthrodesis after the administration combined ME-ketamine (MK) or ME alone.This was a randomised double-blind study. During sevoflurane-remifentanil anaesthesia, 11 patients in each group received the following: ketamine bolus (0.5 mg/kg) after tracheal intubation, followed by an infusion of 2.5 μg/kg/min in the MK or saline bolus plus infusion in the ME group. Post-operative analgesia - during 48 h - was provided by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), delivering bolus containing the following: ME 0.25 mg plus ketamine 0.5 mg in the MK group or ME 0.5 mg in the ME group. Lockout was 10 min, maximum of 3 boluses/h in both groups. Before closing the wound, all the patients received intravenous (i.v.) ME 0.1 mg/kg, dexketoprophen and paracetamol. Pain intensity was evaluated by a numerical rating scale (NRS), on arrival at recovery room (RR) and 24 and 48 h after surgery. In the RR, i.v. ME was administered until NRS was 3 when PCA was started. Dexketoprophen and paracetamol were administered 48 h.Remifentanil requirements were higher in the MK group (P = 0.004). Patients in the MK group received 70% less ME by PCA at 24 h (MK vs. ME group, median and interquartile range) - 3.43 mg (1.9-6.5) vs. 15 mg (9.65-17.38) (P < 0.001) - and at 48 h - 2 mg (0.5-3.63) vs. 9.5 mg (3.5-13.75) (P = 0.001). Patients in the MK group also attempted less doses, at 24 h: 19.5 (12.75-79.5) vs. 98 (41.5-137) (P = 0.043). Both groups had similar NRS values and comparable side effects.Perioperative ketamine-ME combination significantly decreased opioid consumption by PCA.",0
