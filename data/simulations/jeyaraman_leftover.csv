Therefore, the objective of this novel study was to investigate whether postoperative weight-bearing restrictions affect the outcomes of cartilage repair when an osteochondral autograft transfer system is used to repair small defects in weight-bearing areas of femoral articular cartilage.This a retrospective comparative study. Following review of the charts on 567 consecutive arthroscopic osteochondral autograft transfers, three homogeneous groups of patients with consecutive cases were identified: group A, cases of patients who were non-weight-bearing following the procedure (n = 68); group B, cases of those who were non-weight-bearing following the procedure with concomitant anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (n = 29); and group C, cases of those who were weight-bearing as tolerated following the procedure (n = 437). The cases of patients whose knees underwent second-look (repeat) arthroscopy were stratified into two subgroups: non-weight-bearing (n = 20) and weight-bearing as tolerated (n = 42). Graft position and manifestation of a repair-adjacent defect (Outerbridge grade-III or IV cartilage defect that develops adjacent to the original osteochondral autograft transfer repair) were assessed during second-look arthroscopy. Cartilage repair was retrospectively assessed from second-look arthroscopy pictures by a blinded, independent orthopaedic surgeon with use of the International Cartilage Repair Society macroscopic cartilage-repair assessment tool. Postoperative complication rates were compared among the three primary groups.The mean grafted area was 0.72 cm(2) (range, 0.16 to 1.45 cm(2)) and 0.73 cm(2) (range, 0.16 to 1.80 cm(2)) for the non-weight-bearing and weight-bearing-as-tolerated second-look subgroups, respectively. The mean International Cartilage Repair Society score was 11.12 and 11.25 points (near-normal cartilage) for the non-weight-bearing and weight-bearing-as-tolerated subgroups (p = 0.71) at a mean follow-up of 42.7 and 33.0 months, respectively. There was no significant difference in the duration of follow-up (p = 0.58), repair-adjacent defect prevalence (p = 0.94), or graft position (p = 0.99) between the two subgroups. Weight-bearing-as-tolerated patients (group C) experienced significantly fewer deep vein thrombosis and arthrofibrosis complications compared with non-weight-bearing patients (groups A and B) (p < 0.001).Postoperative weight-bearing restrictions did not affect mid-term cartilage repair outcomes in patients who underwent second-look arthroscopy when an osteochondral autograft transfer system was used to repair small defects in weight-bearing areas of cartilage of the medial and/or lateral femoral condyle.Therapeutic Level III.

Patients who had a joint line congruity angle of more than 2°, malalignment of the knee from femoral causes, a fixed flexion deformity, or age older than 55 years were excluded. All patients underwent HTO and microfracture. The cell-recipient group received intra-articular injection of cultured MSCs with hyaluronic acid 3 weeks after surgery, whereas the control group only received hyaluronic acid. The primary outcome measure was the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at intervals of 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Secondary outcome measures were Tegner and Lysholm clinical scores and 1-year postoperative Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) scores.The median age of the patients was 51 years, with a mean body mass index of 23.85. Both treatment arms achieved improvements in Tegner, Lysholm, and IKDC scores. After adjustment for age, baseline scores, and time of evaluation, the cell-recipient group showed significantly better scores. The effect of treatment showed an added improvement of 7.65 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04 to 12.26; P = .001) for IKDC scores, 7.61 (95% CI, 1.44 to 13.79; P = .016) for Lysholm scores, and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.10 to 1.19; P = .021) for Tegner scores. Magnetic resonance imaging scans performed 1 year after surgical intervention showed significantly better MOCART scores for the cell-recipient group. The age-adjusted mean difference in MOCART score was 19.6 (95% CI, 10.5 to 28.6; P < .001).Intra-articular injection of cultured MSCs is effective in improving both short-term clinical and MOCART outcomes in patients undergoing HTO and microfracture for varus knees with cartilage defects.Level II, randomized controlled trial.",1

Hyaluronic acid-based cell-free scaffold was applied in combination with microfracture for 19 knees (group 1), whereas microfracture alone was the surgical intervention for 24 knees (group 2). All lesions were Outerbridge grade III or IV with a mean size of 3.6 ± 1.3 cm2. The mean follow-up time was 25.7 months. Visual analog scale (VAS), Lysholm knee score, and Tegner activity scale were the instruments used to evaluate the clinical status. Magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) system was used to analyze the characteristics of repair tissue.Better VAS and Lysholm scores were detected in group 1 at 12 and 24 months (P = .019 and P = .025). According to the Tegner activity scale, group 1 had also better activity level at the end of 24 months after surgery (P = .020). The mean time from surgery to return to nonimpact sports activities was 7.8 months in group 1, whereas it was 9.2 months in group 2 (P = .013). Complete repair with the filling of the defect was achieved in 7 (36.8%) of the knees in group 1, whereas it was 4 (16.6%) of the knees in group 2 according to the MOCART system at 24 months.Single-stage regenerative cartilage surgery using hyaluronic acid-based cell-free scaffold in combination with microfracture for focal osteochondral lesions of the knee revealed promising clinical outcomes at 24 months of follow-up, but the clinical significance of the differences seen is simply not known.Level III, retrospective comparative study.",1

However, to improve outcomes, an advanced surgical procedure with tissue-engineered scaffolds may be needed to treat patients with large cartilage lesions. Purpose: To investigate the clinical and second-look arthroscopic outcomes of the implantation of MSCs loaded in fibrin glue as a scaffold in patients with OA knees and to compare these outcomes with those of MSC implantation without a scaffold. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This study retrospectively evaluated 54 patients (56 knees) who were examined with second-look arthroscopy after MSC implantation for cartilage lesions in their OA knees. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 37 patients (39 knees) were treated with MSC implantation without a scaffold (group 1), and 17 patients (17 knees) underwent implantation of MSCs loaded in fibrin glue as a scaffold (group 2). Clinical outcomes were evaluated according to the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and the Tegner activity scale, and cartilage repair was assessed with the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade. Statistical analyses were performed to identify various prognostic factors associated with the clinical and second-look arthroscopic outcomes. Results: At final follow-up (mean, 28.6 months; range, 24-34 months), the mean IKDC score and Tegner activity scale in each group significantly improved: group 1, from 38.1 ± 7.7 to 62.0 ± 11.7 (IKDC) and from 2.5 ± 0.9 to 3.5 ± 0.8 (Tegner); group 2, from 36.1 ± 6.2 to 64.4 ± 11.5 (IKDC) and from 2.2 ± 0.8 to 3.8 ± 0.8 (Tegner) ( P &lt; .001 for all). According to the overall ICRS cartilage repair grades, 9 of the 39 lesions (23%) in group 1 and 12 of the 17 lesions (58%) in group 2 achieved a grade of I or II. There was a significant difference in ICRS grades between the groups ( P = .028). Overweight (body mass index ≥ 27.5 kg/m 2 ) and large lesion size (≥5.7 cm 2 ) were significant predictors of poor clinical and arthroscopic outcomes in group 1 ( P &lt; .05 for both). There was a similar trend in group 2, but the differences were not significant, possibly owing to the smaller sample size. Conclusion: Clinical and arthroscopic outcomes of MSC implantation were encouraging for OA knees in both groups, although there were no significant differences in outcome scores between groups. However, at second-look arthroscopy, there were better ICRS grades in group 2.",1

Methods Eighty patients treated with cartilage repair procedures and concomitant HTO were prospectively randomized into two groups: MSC implantation (MSC group), and MSC implantation with allogenic cartilage (MSC-AC group). Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Lysholm Score and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at preoperative and every follow-up visit. Radiological outcomes were evaluated by measuring the femorotibial angle and posterior tibial slope. During second-look arthroscopy, cartilage regeneration was evaluated according to the Kanamiya grade. Results Clinical outcomes at the second-look arthroscopy (mean 12.5 months [MSC group] and 12.4 months [MSC-AC group]) improved significantly in both groups (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001 for all). Clinical outcomes from the second-look arthroscopy to the final follow-up (mean 27.3 months [MSC group] and 27.8 months [MSC-AC group]) improved further only in the MSC-AC group (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05 for all). Overall, the Kanamiya grades, which were significantly correlated with clinical outcomes, were significantly higher in the MSC-AC group than in the MSC group. Radiological outcomes at final follow-up revealed improved knee joint alignments relative to preoperative conditions but without significant correlation between clinical outcomes and Kanamiya grade in either group (n.s. for all). Conclusion Implantation of MSCs with allogenic cartilage is superior to implantation of MSCs alone in cartilage regeneration accompanied with better clinical outcomes.",1

Methods A total of 176 patients who underwent HTO combined with a BMAC or hUCB-MSC procedure for medial compartment osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3) between June 2014 and September 2018 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were reviewed. After HTO, multiple holes were drilled at cartilage defect sites of the medial femoral condyle (MFC), and then prepared BMAC or hUCB-MSCs in combination with scaffolds were implanted in the MFC lesions. After propensity score matching based on sex, age, body mass index, and lesion size, 55 patients in each of the BMAC and hUCB-MSC groups were successfully matched. Second-look arthroscopic findings were assessed according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Cartilage Repair Assessment (CRA) grading system and Koshino staging system. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Short-Form 36 (SF-36), and Tegner activity scores. Results At a mean follow-up of 33 months, clinical outcomes including IKDC, KOOS, SF-36, and Tegner activity scores were significantly improved in both groups (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001); however, there were no differences between the two groups. Second-look arthroscopy showed better healing of regenerated cartilage in the hUCB-MSC group (Grade I [4 cases, 9.1%]; Grade II [30 cases, 68.2%]; Grade III [11 cases, 22.7%]) than in the BMAC group (Grade I [1 case, 2.7%]; Grade II [20 cases, 54.1%]; Grade III [11 cases, 29.7%]; Grade IV [5 cases, 13.5%]) according to the ICRS CRA grading system (p = 0.040). There was no significant intergroup difference in terms of defect coverage based on the Koshino staging system (p = 0.057). Moreover, ICRS CRA grades at second-look arthroscopy were significantly correlated with clinical outcomes (r = - 0.337; p = 0.002). Conclusion There were no significant differences in the clinical outcomes between the two groups. Both treatments provided similar, reliable outcomes in terms of pain relief, functional scores, and quality of life at a mean follow-up of 33 months. However, hUCB-MSC implantation was more effective than BMAC augmentation for articular cartilage regeneration.",1

METHODS: Among 436 patients treated with HTO for medial unicompartmental OA with varus deformity between 2010 and 2016, clinical outcomes were retrospectively compared between the microfracture alone group (group I, 43 cases) and microfracture with BMAC augmentation group (group II, 48 cases). Of these, 64 patients underwent a second-look arthroscopic assessment. Clinical outcomes were compared based on the Knee Society Score (KSS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC). Cartilage regeneration was assessed according to Koshino's staging system and the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Cartilage Repair Assessment (CRA) grading system. RESULTS: At the last follow-up, there were no significant intergroup differences in terms of KSS for pain and function (p \textbackslashtextgreater 0.05). Moreover, WOMAC scores were similar between the two groups (p \textbackslashtextgreater 0.05). Regarding second-look arthroscopy findings, according to Koshino's staging system, there was no significant intergroup difference in terms of defect coverage (p = 0.187). However, group II showed a significantly better mean CRA score than group I (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes and cartilage regeneration between the groups. However, the CRA score was significantly higher with BMAC augmentation and microfracture than microfracture alone. Therefore, BMAC augmentation had a synergistic effect for a better cartilage regeneration, although studies with a longer follow-up might help to confirm whether microfracture with BMAC augmentation would ensure better clinical outcomes than microfracture alone for the treatment of knee OA.",1

To overcome the shortcomings of the microfracture technique, various augmentation techniques have been developed. However, their efficacies remain unclear. Hypothesis: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be superior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture and collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture alone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: microfracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen augmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look arthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time of HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International Cartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, imaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Finally, clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity scale score were evaluated. Results: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in group 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater improvement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, middle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P &lt; .050 for all comparisons). Imaging outcomes based on the MOCART score were superior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year postoperatively (64.6 vs 45.4, respectively; P = .001). The degree of defect repair was better in group 2 than in group 1 ( P = .040). Clinical outcomes in terms of the VAS for pain score, KOOS, IKDC score, and Tegner activity scale score were improved in both groups without between-group differences ( P &gt; .100 for all comparisons). Conclusion: The quality of cartilage repair after microfracture with collagen augmentation was superior to that after microfracture alone in patients undergoing HTO. Clinical results after 1 year did not reflect this difference in tissue repair. Therefore, a longer follow-up of the cohort is needed to answer this question.",1

Purpose: To investigate the medium-term clinical outcomes of cartilage repair using a 1-stage technique of a hyaluronic acid–based scaffold with activated bone marrow aspirate concentrate (HA-BMAC) and compare results with those of microfracture. A secondary aim of this study was to identify specific patient demographic factors and cartilage lesion characteristics that are associated with superior outcomes. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Fifty physically active patients (mean age, 45 years) with grade IV cartilage injury of the knee (lesion size, 1.5-24 cm 2 ) were treated with HA-BMAC or microfracture and were observed prospectively for 5 years. Patients were placed into the HA-BMAC group if the health insurance policy of the treating institution supported this option; otherwise, they were placed into the microfracture group. Objective and subjective clinical assessment tools were used preoperatively and at 2 and 5 years postoperatively to compare treatment outcomes. Results: Significant improvements in outcome scores were achieved in both treatment groups at 2 years ( P &lt; .001). In the microfracture group, 64% were classified as normal or nearly normal according to the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) objective score at 2 years, compared with 100% of those treated with HA-BMAC ( P &lt; .001). Normal or nearly normal objective assessments in the microfracture group declined significantly after 5 years to 28% of patients ( P = .004). All patients treated with HA-BMAC maintained improvement at 5 years according to Lysholm, Tegner, IKDC objective, and IKDC subjective scores. Tegner, IKDC objective, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) assessments demonstrated higher scores in the HA-BMAC treatment group compared with microfracture at 5 years. Lysholm and IKDC subjective scores were similar between treatment groups at 5 years. Poorer outcomes in the microfracture group were demonstrated in cases of lesions larger than 4 cm 2 and nonsolitary lesions. Age greater than 45 years, large size of lesion, and treatment of multiple lesions were not associated with poorer outcome in patients treated with HA-BMAC. Conclusion: Repair of chondral injury using a hyaluronic acid–based scaffold with activated bone marrow aspirate concentrate provides better clinical outcomes and more durable cartilage repair at medium-term follow-up compared with microfracture. Positive short-term clinical outcomes can be achieved with either microfracture or HA-BMAC. Cartilage repair using HA-BMAC leads to successful medium-term outcomes independent of age or lesion size.",1

Design Prospectively collected data from 132 patients (mean age, 41.8 years; 69% male) with isolated chondral or osteochondral femoral defects treated with biphasic synthetic scaffolds ( n = 66) or microfracture ( n = 66) were reviewed. Clinical outcomes were evaluated longitudinally over 5 years with the Short Form–36 (SF-36), Activities of Daily Living of the Knee Outcome Survey (KOS-ADL), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Marx Activity Scale. Cartilage-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to evaluate osseous integration and cartilage fill in a subgroup of patients. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify predictors of clinical outcomes within the scaffold group. Results Both groups demonstrated clinically significant improvements in knee clinical scores over 5 years ( P &lt; 0.01). There were no significant differences in KOS-ADL and IKDC scores between groups up to 5 years postoperatively. Marx activity level scores in the microfracture group declined over time, while significant improvements in activity level scores were observed in the scaffold group over 5 years ( P &lt; 0.01). Good-quality tissue fill and cartilage isointensity were more often observed in the scaffold group compared with the microfracture group, particularly with longer time intervals. Increasing age, high body mass index, prior microfracture, and traumatic etiology were predictors for inferior outcomes in the scaffold group. Conclusions Activity level and MRI appearance following treatment of cartilage lesions with the biphasic synthetic scaffold were superior to microfracture over time in this nonrandomized, retrospective comparison.",1

The objective of the present study was to compare autologous chondrocyte implantation with microfracture in a randomized trial. We are not aware of any previous randomized studies comparing these methods.Eighty patients without general osteoarthritis who had a single symptomatic cartilage defect on the femoral condyle in a stable knee were treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation or microfracture (forty in each group). We used the International Cartilage Repair Society, Lysholm, Short Form-36 (SF-36), and Tegner forms to collect data. An independent observer performed a follow-up examination at twelve and twenty-four months. Two years postoperatively, arthroscopy with biopsy for histological evaluation was carried out. The histological evaluation was done by a pathologist and a clinical scientist, both of whom were blinded to each patient's treatment.In general, there were small differences between the two treatment groups. At two years, both groups had significant clinical improvement. According to the SF-36 physical component score at two years postoperatively, the improvement in the microfracture group was significantly better than that in the autologous chondrocyte implantation group (p = 0.004). Younger and more active patients did better in both groups. There were two failures in the autologous chondrocyte implantation group and one in the microfracture group. No serious complications were reported. Biopsy specimens were obtained from 84% of the patients, and histological evaluation of repair tissues showed no significant differences between the two groups. We did not find any association between the histological quality of the tissue and the clinical outcome according to the scores on the Lysholm or SF-36 form or the visual analog scale.Both methods had acceptable short-term clinical results. There was no significant difference in macroscopic or histological results between the two treatment groups and no association between the histological findings and the clinical outcome at the two-year time-point.Therapeutic study, Level I-1a (randomized controlled trial [significant difference]).

There was a lack of blinding for patients because of the additional intervention method (liposuction). The cartilage defect was diagnosed using preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and quantitative and qualitative assessments of the repair tissue were carried out at 24 months by using the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue scoring system with follow-up MRI. Clinical results were evaluated using the Lysholm score, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and a 10-point visual analog scale for pain (0 points, no pain; 10 points, worst possible pain) preoperatively and postoperatively at 3 months, 12 months, and the last follow-up visit.The 2 groups had similar baseline patient characteristics. Follow-up MRI was performed at 24 months (mean, 24.3 months; range, 24.0 to 25.1 months) after the operation. Group 1 included 26 patients (65%) who had complete cartilage coverage of the lesion at follow-up compared with 18 patients (45%) in group 2. Significantly better signal intensity was observed for the repair tissue in group 1, with 32 patients (80%) having normal or nearly normal signal intensity (i.e., complete cartilage coverage of the lesion) compared with 28 patients (72.5%) in group 2. The mean clinical follow-up period was 27.4 months (range, 26 to 30 months). The improvements in the mean KOOS pain and symptom subscores were significantly greater at follow-up in group 1 than in group 2 (pain, 36.6 ± 11.9 in group 1 and 30.1 ± 14.7 in group 2 [P = .034]; symptoms, 32.3 ± 7.2 in group 1 and 27.8 ± 6.8 in group 2 [P = .005]). However, the improvements in the other subscores were not significantly different between group 1 and group 2 (activities of daily living, 38.5 ± 12.8 and 37.6 ± 12.9, respectively [P = .767]; sports and recreation, 33.9 ± 10.3 and 31.6 ± 11.0, respectively [P = .338]; quality of life, 38.4 ± 13.1 and 37.8 ± 12.0, respectively [P = .650]). Among the 80 patients, second-look arthroscopies were performed in 57 knees (30 in group 1 and 27 in group 2), and biopsy procedures were performed during these arthroscopies for 18 patients in group 1 and 16 patients in group 2. The second-look arthroscopies showed good repair tissue quality, although no significant intergroup difference was observed. The mean total histologic score was 1,054 for group 1 compared with 967 for group 2 (P = .036). Age, lesion size, duration of symptoms before surgery, mechanism of injury, and combined procedures were not correlated with clinical results, Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue scores, and histologic outcomes at short-term follow-up.Compared with MFX alone, MFX and ADSCs with fibrin glue provided radiologic and KOOS pain and symptom subscore improvements, with no differences in activity, sports, or quality-of-life subscores, in symptomatic single cartilage defects of the knee that were 3 cm(2) or larger, with similar structural repair tissue.Level II, prospective comparative study.",1

Clinical results were evaluated using International Knee Documentation committee (IKDC) knee evaluation questionnaires and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) before and 48 weeks after surgery. Quantitative and qualitative assessments of repair tissue were carried out at 48 weeks by T2 mapping of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) and the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) scoring system with follow-up MRI.No significant differences between preoperative and postoperative IKDC and KOOS were observed in the cell-T or control group. However, forty-eight weeks after surgery, the cell-T group showed a trend for a greater KOOS QOL score compared with the control group (79.4 vs. 39.1, respectively; P=0.07). The T2 value did not differ significantly between the two groups, but the mean MOCART score was significantly higher in the cell-T group than in the control group (P=0.02).Compared with MFX alone, BMSC transplantation with MFX resulted in better postoperative healing of the cartilage and subchondral bone as determined by the MOCART score. Clinically, BMSC transplantation with MFX gave a higher KOOS QOL score after 48 weeks.",1

Purpose: To determine whether implantation of a composite of allogeneic umbilical cord blood–derived mesenchymal stem cells and 4% hyaluronate (UCB-MSC-HA) will result in reliable cartilage restoration in patients with large, full-thickness cartilage defects and whether any clinical improvements can be maintained up to 5 years postoperatively. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A randomized controlled phase 3 clinical trial was conducted for 48 weeks, and the participants then underwent extended 5-year observational follow-up. Enrolled were patients with large, full-thickness cartilage defects (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade 4) in a single compartment of the knee joint, as confirmed by arthroscopy. The defect was treated either with UCB-MSC-HA implantation through mini-arthrotomy or with microfracture. The primary outcome was proportion of participants who improved by ≥1 grade on the ICRS Macroscopic Cartilage Repair Assessment (blinded evaluation) at 48-week arthroscopy. Secondary outcomes included histologic assessment; changes in pain visual analog scale (VAS) score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score from baseline; and adverse events. Results: Among 114 randomized participants (mean age, 55.9 years; 67% female; body mass index, 26.2 kg/m 2 ), 89 completed the phase 3 clinical trial and 73 were enrolled in the 5-year follow-up study. The mean defect size was 4.9 cm 2 in the UCB-MSC-HA group and 4.0 cm 2 in the microfracture group ( P = .051). At 48 weeks, improvement by ≥1 ICRS grade was seen in 97.7% of the UCB-MSC-HA group versus 71.7% of the microfracture group ( P = .001); the overall histologic assessment score was also superior in the UCB-MSC-HA group ( P = .036). Improvement in VAS pain, WOMAC, and IKDC scores were not significantly different between the groups at 48 weeks, however the clinical results were significantly better in the UCB-MSC-HA group at 3- to 5-year follow-up ( P &lt; .05). There were no differences between the groups in adverse events. Conclusion: In older patients with symptomatic, large, full-thickness cartilage defects with or without osteoarthritis, UCB-MSC-HA implantation resulted in improved cartilage grade at second-look arthroscopy and provided more improvement in pain and function up to 5 years compared with microfracture.

Characterized chondrocyte implantation uses an autologous cartilage cell therapy product that has been optimized for its biological potency to form stable cartilage tissue in vivo. Purpose To determine whether, in symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyle, structural regeneration with characterized chondrocyte implantation is superior to repair with microfracture. Study Design Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods Characterized chondrocyte implantation was compared with microfracture in patients with single grade III to IV symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyles in a multicenter trial. Patients aged 18 to 50 years were randomized to characterized chondrocyte implantation (n = 57) or microfracture (n = 61). Structural repair was blindly assessed in biopsy specimens taken at 1 year using (1) computerized histomorphometry and (2) evaluation of overall histological components of structural repair. Clinical outcome was measured using the self administered Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study. Results Characterized chondrocyte implantation resulted in better structural repair, as assessed by histomorphometry ( P = .003) and overall histologic evaluation ( P = .012). Aspects of structural repair relating to chondrocyte phenotype and tissue structure were superior with characterized chondrocyte implantation. Clinical outcome as measured by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score at 12 to 18 months after characterized chondrocyte implantation was comparable with microfracture at this stage. Both treatment groups had a similar mean baseline overall Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (56.30 ± 13.61 and 59.53 ± 14.95 for microfracture and characterized chondrocyte implantation, respectively), which increased in both groups to 70.56 ± 12.39 and 72.63 ± 15.55 at 6 months, 73.26 ± 14.66 and 73.10 ± 16.01 at 12 months, and 74.73 ± 17.01 and 75.04 ± 14.50 at 18 months, respectively. Both techniques were generally well tolerated; the incidence of adverse events after characterized chondrocyte implantation was not markedly increased compared with that for microfracture. Conclusion One year after treatment, characterized chondrocyte implantation was associated with a tissue regenerate that was superior to that after microfracture. Short-term clinical outcome was similar for both treatments. The superior structural outcome may result in improved long-term clinical benefit with characterized chondrocyte implantation. Long-term follow-up is needed to confirm these findings.",1

Purpose To test whether matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation or the original periosteal flap technique provides superior outcomes in terms of clinical efficacy and safety. Study Design Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods Twenty-one patients (mean age, 29.3 ± 9.1 years) with symptomatic isolated full-thickness cartilage defects (mean 4.1 ± 09 cm2) at the femoral condyle were randomized to matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation or the original periosteal flap technique. The primary outcome parameter was the postoperative change in knee function as assessed by the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at 12 months after ACI. In addition, the IKDC score was assessed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Secondary outcome parameters were postoperative changes in health related quality of life (Short Form-36 Health Survey), knee functionality (Lysholm and Gillquist score), and physical activity (Tegner Activity Score) at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after ACI. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed to evaluate the cartilage 6, 12, and 24 months after ACI and rated using the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue score. Adverse events were recorded to assess safety. Results The primary outcome parameter showed improvement of patients 1 year after autologous chondrocyte implantation, but there was no difference between the periosteal flap technique and matrix-associated ACI (P = .5573); 2 years after ACI, a similar result was found (P = .4994). The study groups did not show differences in the Short Form-36 categories and in knee functionality as assessed by Tegner Activity Score 12 months (P = .4063) and 24 months (P = .1043) after ACI. There was a significant difference in the Lysholm and Gillquist score at 12 months (P = .0449) and 24 months (P = .0487) favoring the periosteal flap technique group. At 6 months after surgery, a significantly lower Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair score was obtained in the matrix-associated ACI group (P = .0123), corresponding to more normal magnetic resonance imaging diagnostic findings. Twelve and 24 months after ACI, the differences between the 2 groups were not significant (12 months, P = .2065; 24 months, P = .6926). Adverse events were related to knee problems such as transplant delamination, development of an osseous spur, osteochondral dissection, and transplant hypertrophy. Systemic (allergic, toxic, or autoimmune) reactions did not occur. Conclusion There was no difference in the efficacy between the original and the advanced ACI technique 12 and 24 months after surgery regarding International Knee Documentation Committee, Tegner Activity Score, and Short Form-36; however, with respect to the Lysholm and Gillquist score, better efficacy was observed in the periosteal flap technique group.",1

Design Thirty subjects with an International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade 3 to 4 chondral defect (2-10 cm 2 in area; ≤4 cm 3 in volume) were randomized at a ratio of 2:1 (CCP-ACI:MFx). Twenty patients were allocated in the CCP-ACI group and 10 patients in the MFx group. CCP-ACI was performed by harvesting costal cartilage at least 4 weeks before surgery. Implantation was performed without any marrow stimulation. Efficacy and safety were assessed at weeks 8, 24, and 48 after surgery according to the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and clinical outcomes. Results MOCART scores improved from baseline to 24 and 48 weeks postoperatively in both treatment groups. The improvement in MOCART scores in the CCP-ACI group was significantly greater than that in the MFx group at 24 and 48 weeks (39.1 vs 21.8 and 43.0 vs 24.8, respectively). The proportions of complete defect repair and complete integration were significantly higher in the CCP-ACI group than the MFx group at 48 weeks. Improvement in Lysholm score and KOOS subscores, including Function (Sports and Recreational Activity) and knee-related quality of life was significantly greater in the CCP-ACI group than the MFx group at 48 weeks (35.4 vs 31.5, 35.7 vs 28.5, and 27.9 vs 11.6, respectively). Conclusion Treatment of cartilage defects with CCP-ACI yielded satisfactory cartilage tissue repair outcomes, with good structural integration with native cartilage tissue shown by magnetic resonance imaging at 24 and 48 weeks after surgery.

A single-stage procedure that uses autologous cartilage fragments, Cartilage Autograft Implantation System (CAIS), is being evaluated in patients and may offer a clinically effective option. Purpose: To establish the safety of CAIS and to test whether CAIS improves quality of life by using standardized outcomes assessment tools. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Patients (n = 29) were randomized (1:2) with the intent to treat with either a control (microfracture [MFX]) or an experimental (CAIS) procedure. Patients were followed at predetermined time points for 2 years using several standardized outcomes assessment tools (SF-36, International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC], Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at baseline, 3 weeks, and 6, 12, and 24 months. Results: Lesion size and International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade were similar in both groups. General outcome measures (eg, physical component score of the SF-36) indicated an overall improvement in both groups, and no differences in the number of adverse effects were noted in comparisons between the CAIS and MFX groups. The IKDC score of the CAIS group was significantly higher (73.9 ± 14.72 at 12 months and 82.95 ± 14.88 at 24 months) compared with the MFX group (57.78 ± 18.31 at 12 months and 59.5 ± 13.44 at 24 months). Select subdomains (4/5) in the KOOS instrument were significantly different at 12 and 18 months, and all subdomains (Symptoms and Stiffness, Pain, Activities of Daily Living, Sports and Recreation, Knee-related Quality of Life) were significantly increased at 24 months in CAIS with scores of 88.47 ± 11.68, 90.64 ± 7.87, 97.29 ± 3.8, 78.16 ± 22.06, and 69 ± 23.15 compared with 75 ± 9.31, 78.94 ± 13.73, 89.46 ± 8.13, 51.67 ± 26.01, and 37.15 ± 21.67 in the MFX group. These significant improvements were maintained at 24 months in both IKDC and KOOS. Qualitative analysis of the imaging data did not note differences between the 2 groups in fill of the graft bed, tissue integration, or presence of subchondral cysts. Patients treated with MFX had a significantly higher incidence of intralesional osteophyte formation (54% and 70% of total number of lesions treated) at 6 and 12 months when compared with CAIS (8% and 25% of total number of lesions treated). Conclusion: The first clinical experience in using CAIS for treating patients with focal chondral defects indicates that it is a safe, feasible, and effective method that may improve long-term clinical outcomes.",1

Purpose: To compare the structural, clinical, and safety outcomes at midterm follow-up of MACT versus MFx for treating symptomatic knee cartilage lesions. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 48 patients aged between 18 and 50 years, with 1- to 4-cm 2 International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade III to IV knee chondral lesions, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the MACT and MFx treatment groups. A sequential prospective evaluation was performed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2 mapping, the MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) score, second-look arthroscopic surgery, patient-reported outcome measures, the responder rate (based on achieving the minimal clinically important difference for the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS] pain and KOOS Sport/Recreation), adverse events, and treatment failure (defined as a reoperation because of symptoms caused by the primary defect and the detachment or absence of &gt;50% of the repaired tissue during revision surgery). Results: Overall, 35 patients (18 MACT and 17 MFx) with a mean chondral lesion size of 1.8 ± 0.8 cm 2 (range, 1-4 cm 2 ) were followed up to a mean of 6 years postoperatively (range, 4-9 years). MACT demonstrated significantly better structural outcomes than MFx at 1 to 6 years postoperatively. At final follow-up, the MRI T2 mapping values of the repaired tissue were 37.7 ± 8.5 ms for MACT versus 46.4 ± 8.5 ms for MFx ( P = .003), while the MOCART scores were 59.4 ± 17.3 and 42.4 ± 16.3, respectively ( P = .006). More than 50% defect filling was seen in 95% of patients at 2 years and 82% at 6 years in the MACT group and in 67% at 2 years and 53% at 6 years in the MFx group. The second-look ICRS scores at 1 year were 10.7 ± 1.3 for MACT and 9.0 ± 1.8 for MFx ( P = .001). Both groups showed significant clinical improvements at 6 years postoperatively compared with their preoperative status. Significant differences favoring the MACT group were observed at 2 years on the KOOS Activities of Daily Living ( P = .043), at 4 years on all KOOS subscales (except Symptoms; P &lt; .05) and the Tegner scale ( P = .008), and at 6 years on the Tegner scale ( P = .010). The responder rates at 6 years were 53% and 77% for MFx and MACT, respectively. There were no reported treatment failures after MACT; the failure rate was 8.3% in the MFx group. Neither group had serious adverse events related to treatment. Conclusion: Patients who underwent MACT had better structural outcomes than those who underwent MFx at 1 to 6 years postoperatively. Both groups of patients showed significant clinical improvements at final follow-up compared with their preoperative status. MACT showed superiority at 4 years for the majority of the KOOS subscales and for the Tegner scale at 4 to 6 years. The MACT group also had a higher responder rate and lower failure rate at final follow-up. Registration: NCT01947374 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier).",1

Purpose: We aimed to establish whether MACI or ACI-P provides superior long-term outcomes in terms of patient satisfaction, clinical assessment, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 21 patients with cartilage defects at the femoral condyle were randomized to MACI (n = 11) or ACI-P (n = 10) between the years 2004 and 2006. Patients were assessed for subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm and Gillquist score, Tegner Activity Score, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) preoperatively (T0), at 1 and 2 years postoperatively (T1, T2), and at the final follow-up 8 to 11 years after surgery (T3). Onset of osteoarthritis was determined using the Kellgren-Lawrence score and Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score, and delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage was used to evaluate the cartilage. Adverse events were recorded to assess safety. Results: There were 16 patients (MACI, n = 9; ACI-P, n = 7) who were reassessed on average 9.6 years after surgery (76% follow-up rate). The Lysholm and Gillquist score improved in both groups after surgery and remained elevated but reached statistical significance only in ACI-P at T1 and T2. IKDC scores increased significantly at all postoperative evaluation time points in ACI-P. In MACI, IKDC scores showed a significant increase at T1 and T3 when compared with T0. In the majority of the patients (10/16; MACI, 5/9; ACI-P, 5/7) a complete defect filling was present at the final follow-up as shown by the MOCART score, and 1 patient in the ACI-P group displayed hypertrophy of the repair tissue, which represents 6% of the whole study group and 14.3% of the ACI-P group. Besides higher SF-36 vitality scores in ACI-P at T3, no significant differences were seen in clinical scores and MRI scores between the 2 methods at any time point. Revision rate was 33.3% in MACI and 28.6% in ACI-P at the last follow-up. Conclusion: Our long-term results suggest that first- and third-generation ACI methods are equally effective treatments for isolated full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee. With the number of participants available, no significant difference was noted between MACI and ACI-P at any time point. Interpretation of our data has to be performed with caution due to the small sample size, which was further limited by a loss to follow-up of 24%.",1

Autologous chondrocyte implantation using a characterized cell therapy product results in significantly better early structural repair as compared with microfracture in patients with symptomatic joint surface defects of the femoral condyles of the knee. Purpose To evaluate clinical outcome at 36 months after characterized chondrocyte implantation (CCI) versus microfracture (MF). Study Design Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods Patients aged 18 to 50 years with single International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade III/IV symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyles were randomized to CCI (n = 57) or MF (n = 61). Clinical outcome was measured over 36 months by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were scored using the Magnetic resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) system and 9 additional items. Gene expression profile scores associated with ectopic cartilage formation were determined by RT-PCR. Results Baseline mean overall KOOS (±SE) was comparable between the CCI and MF groups (56.30 ± 1.91 vs 59.46 ± 1.98, respectively). Mean improvement (±SE) from baseline to 36 months in overall KOOS was greater in the CCI group than the MF group (21.25 ± 3.60 vs 15.83 ± 3.48, respectively), while in a mixed linear model analysis with time as a categorical variable, significant differences favoring CCI were shown in overall KOOS (P = .048) and the subdomains of Pain (P = .044) and QoL (P = .036). More CCI- than MF-treated patients were treatment responders (83% vs 62%, respectively). In patients with symptom onset of &lt;2 years, the mean improvement (±SE) from baseline to 36 months in overall KOOS was greater with CCI than MF (24.98 ± 4.34 vs 16.50 ± 3.99, respectively) and even greater in patients with symptom onset of &lt;3 years (26.08 ± 4.10 vs 17.09 ± 3.77, respectively). Characterized chondrocyte implantation patients with high (&gt;2) versus low (&lt;2) gene profile scores showed greater improvement from baseline in mean overall KOOS (±SE) at 36 months (28.91 ± 5.69 vs 18.18 ± 5.08, respectively). Subchondral bone reaction significantly worsened over time with MF compared with CCI (P &lt; .05). Conclusion Characterized chondrocyte implantation for the treatment of articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyles of the knee results in significantly better clinical outcome at 36 months in a randomized trial compared with MF. Time to treatment and chondrocyte quality were shown to affect outcome.",1

Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes were assessed 12 and 24 months postoperatively for efficacy and adverse events. Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) assessment was used to analyze cartilage tissue repair. MRI outcomes for 50% defect filling and repaired tissue/reference cartilage (RT/RC) ratio were quantified using T2 mapping. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and 20% improvement, minimal clinically important difference (MCID), and patient acceptable symptom state for Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and the International Knee Documentation Committee score. <h3>Results</h3> MOCART scores in the investigation group showed improved defect repair and filling (<i>P</i> = .0201), integration with the border zone (<i>P</i> = .0062), and effusion (<i>P</i> = .0079). MRI outcomes showed that the odds ratio (OR) for ≥50% defect filling at 12 months was statistically higher in the investigation group (OR 3.984, <i>P</i> = .0377). Moreover, the likelihood of the RT/RC OR becoming ≥1 was significantly higher (OR 11.37, <i>P</i> = .0126) in the investigation group.

NeoCart, an autologous cartilage tissue implant, was compared with microfracture in a multisite prospective, randomized trial of a tissue-engineered bioimplant for treating articular cartilage injuries in the knee.Thirty patients were randomized at a ratio of two to one (two were treated with an autologous cartilage tissue implant [NeoCart] for each patient treated with microfracture) at the time of arthroscopic confirmation of an International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade-III lesion(s). Microfracture or cartilage biopsy was performed. NeoCart, produced by seeding a type-I collagen matrix scaffold with autogenous chondrocytes and bioreactor treatment, was implanted six weeks following arthroscopic cartilage biopsy. Standard evaluations were performed with validated clinical outcomes measures.Three, six, twelve, and twenty-four-month data are reported. The mean duration of follow-up (and standard deviation) was 26 ± 2 months. There were twenty-one patients in the NeoCart group and nine in the microfracture group. The mean age (40 ± 9 years), body mass index (BMI) (28 ± 4 kg/m2), duration between the first symptoms and treatment (3 ± 5 years), and lesion size (287 ± 138 mm2 in the NeoCart group and 252 ± 135 mm2 in the microfracture group) were similar between the groups. Adverse event rates per procedure did not differ between the treatment arms. The scores on the Short Form-36 (SF-36), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) activities of daily living (ADL) scale, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form improved from baseline (p < 0.05) to two years postoperatively in both treatment groups. In the NeoCart group, improvement, compared with baseline, was significant (p < 0.05) for all measures at six, twelve, and twenty-four months. Improvement in the NeoCart group was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than that in the microfracture group for the KOOS pain score at six, twelve, and twenty-four months; the KOOS symptom score at six months; the IKDC, KOOS sports, and visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores at twelve and twenty-four months; and the KOOS quality of life (QOL) score at twenty-four months. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) at one year indicated that the change in the KOOS pain (p = 0.016) and IKDC (p = 0.028) scores from pretreatment levels favored the NeoCart group. Significantly more NeoCart-treated patients (p = 0.0125) had responded to therapy (were therapeutic responders) at six months (43% versus 25% in the microfracture group) and twelve months (76% versus 22% in the microfracture group). This trend continued, as the proportion of NeoCart-treated patients (fifteen of nineteen) who were therapeutic responders at twenty-four months was greater than the proportion of microfracture-treated participants (four of nine) who were therapeutic responders at that time.This randomized study suggests that the safety of autologous cartilage tissue implantation, with use of the NeoCart technique, is similar to that of microfracture surgery and is associated with greater clinical efficacy at two years after treatment.",1

Current approaches of cartilage restoration have not proven to produce hyaline cartilage and have limited clinical longevity. The objective of the current study was to evaluate a novel autologous cartilage tissue implant, NeoCart, at the conclusion of the FDA-regulated exploratory phase II randomized, prospective clinical trial. The primary surgical standard-of-care, microfracture, was set by the FDA as the control. Objectives included parameter setting for the phase III trial while conducting a preliminary long-term evaluation of safety and efficacy.  Methods: Patients were randomized 2:1 to NeoCart (n=21) or microfracture (n=9) surgical intervention at time of arthroscopy. Baseline demographics and patient-reported outcomes were established including: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC); Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) components including Pain, Activity of Daily Living, Quality of Life, Symptoms, Sports & Recreation; Short Form 36; and Visual Analog Scale Pain. Adverse events (AEs), range of motion, and patient reported outcomes were assessed annually for 5 years.  Results: The treatment and control groups did not significantly differ in age, gender distribution, symptom duration, lesion size, or baseline patient reported outcomes aside from pre-surgical Visual Analog Scale Pain scores and KOOS Sports and Recreation. AE rates did not differ between treatments. The control group had greater loss to follow-up over a 5-year period. Change from baseline was significantly greater for NeoCart than for microfracture for primary end points; IKDC (1, 2 years) and KOOS Pain (1, 3, 4 years), and secondary end points; KOOS Quality of Life, Symptoms, and Sports & Recreation until 4 years. At 5 years, IKDC, KOOS Pain, Activities of Daily Living, and Quality of Life, and Short Form 36 Physical scores for both treatments improved significantly (P<0.05). Improvements for NeoCart were sustained earlier and throughout the entire study period.  Conclusions: NeoCart implantation has a safety and efficacy profile supporting further consideration of this therapy in a confirmatory phase III trial for establishment as a primary cartilage injury treatment. While clinical trials for surgical interventions depend on comparison with a standard-of-care, the favorability of the control procedure, microfracture, varied over the study duration. The known short duration of microfracture’s therapeutic effect was likely associated with high loss to follow-up in the small control group. Although adequate for setting phase III parameters, this study is under-powered to clearly attribute differences in longer term efficacy. Nonetheless, preliminary results demonstrate that NeoCart may provide an alternative primary surgical option for cartilage injury with a more rapid onset of action than microfracture.",1

After the confirmation of the lesion, they all received the same bone marrow stimulation technique (microfracture) and were randomized into two groups: the first one had additional PRP injection (group A), while the second received PRP and AD-MSC injection (group B). Knee assessment and pain score were documented with Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Short-Form (SF) 12, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before the treatment and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up postoperatively. An additional arthroscopic procedure, performed in four patients for a subsequent meniscal lesion, let us evaluate cartilage evolution by performing a macro/microscopical assessment on cartilage biopsy specimens.At the 12-month follow-up, both groups showed a comparable functional improvement. The scores on the IKDC form, KOOS, pain VAS, and SF-12 significantly improved from baseline (p < 0.05) to 12 months postoperatively in both treatment groups. The four second-look arthroscopies showed a complete repair of the articular defects by smooth solid cartilage layer, with a good chondrocytic population, in both groups. A thick smooth hyaline-like cartilage with a predominantly viable cell population and normal mineralization (a form closely resembling native tissue) was observed in group B.Modern regenerative medicine techniques, such as PRP and AD-MSC, associated with traditional arthroscopic bone marrow stimulating techniques, seem to enhance cartilage restoration ability. The preliminary results of this pilot study encourage the synergic use of these regenerative modulating systems to improve the quality of the regenerated cartilage.",1

We propose a novel, scaffold-less technique of cartilage repair in the human knee that combines arthroscopic microfracture and outpatient intra-articular injections of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hyaluronic acid (HA). Materials and Methods: Seventy matched (age, sex, lesion size) knees with symptomatic cartilage defects underwent cartilage repair with the proposed technique (n = 35) or an open technique (n = 35) in which the MSCs were implanted beneath a sutured periosteal patch over the defect. Prospective evaluation of both groups were performed using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Cartilage Injury Evaluation Package, which included questions from the Short-Form (SF-36) Health Survey, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation form, Lysholm knee scale, and Tegner activity level scale. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation was also performed at 1 year for most patients. Results: There were no clinically significant adverse events reported through the course of our study. At the final follow-up (mean = 24.5 months), there was significant improvement in mean IKDC, Lysholm, SF-36 physical component score and visual analogue pain scores in both treatment groups. Conclusion: In the short term, the results of this novel technique are comparable to the open procedure with the added advantages of being minimally invasive and requiring only a single operation under general anaesthesia. Its safety has been validated and its efficacy is currently being evaluated in an ongoing randomised controlled trial. Key words: Chondral, Novel, Osteoarthritis, Regeneration",1

BST-CarGel, a chitosan-based medical device, is mixed with autologous whole blood and is applied to a microfractured cartilage lesion in which it physically stabilizes the clot and guides and enhances marrow-derived repair. An international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate BST-CarGel treatment compared with microfracture alone in the repair of cartilage lesions in the knee.Eighty patients between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five years with a single, symptomatic focal lesion on the femoral condyles were randomized to BST-CarGel and microfracture treatment (n = 41) or microfracture treatment alone (n = 39). The primary end points of repair tissue quantity and quality at twelve months were assessed by quantitative three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging measuring the degree of lesion filling and T2 relaxation time with use of standardized one and twelve-month posttreatment scans. The secondary end point at twelve months was clinical benefit determined with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. The tertiary end point was quality of life determined by the Short Form-36. Safety was assessed through the recording of adverse events.Patient baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups, although baseline lesion areas were slightly larger on quantitative magnetic resonance imaging for the BST-CarGel group compared with the microfracture group. Blinded quantitative magnetic resonance imaging analysis demonstrated that, at twelve months, when compared with microfracture treatment alone, BST-CarGel treatment met both primary end points by achieving statistical superiority for greater lesion filling (p = 0.011) and more hyaline cartilage-like T2 values (p = 0.033). The lesion filling values were 92.8% ± 2.0% for the BST-CarGel treatment group and 85.2% ± 2.1% for the microfracture treatment group, and the mean T2 values were 70.5 ± 4.5 ms for the BST-CarGel treatment group and 85.0 ± 4.9 ms for the microfracture treatment group. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscales for pain, stiffness, and function yielded equivalent improvement for both groups at twelve months, which were significant (p < 0.0001) from baseline. Treatment safety profiles were considered comparable.At twelve months, BST-CarGel treatment resulted in greater lesion filling and superior repair tissue quality compared with microfracture treatment alone. Clinical benefit was equivalent between groups at twelve months, and safety was similar.",1

This report was undertaken to investigate 5-year structural and clinical outcomes. Design The international randomized controlled trial enrolled 80 patients, aged 18 to 55 years, with grade III or IV focal lesions on the femoral condyles. Patients were randomized to receive BST-CarGel® treatment or microfracture alone, and followed standardized 12-week rehabilitation. Co-primary endpoints of repair tissue quantity and quality were evaluated by 3-dimensional MRI quantification of the degree of lesion filling (%) and T2 relaxation times. Secondary endpoints were clinical benefit measured with WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) questionnaires and safety. General estimating equations were used for longitudinal statistical analysis of repeated measures. Results Blinded MRI analysis demonstrated that BST-CarGel®-treated patients showed a significantly greater treatment effect for lesion filling ( P = 0.017) over 5 years compared with microfracture alone. A significantly greater treatment effect for BST-CarGel® was also found for repair tissue T2 relaxation times ( P = 0.026), which were closer to native cartilage compared to the microfracture group. BST-CarGel® and microfracture groups showed highly significant improvement at 5 years from pretreatment baseline for each WOMAC subscale ( P &lt; 0.0001), and there were no differences between the treatment groups. Safety was comparable for both groups. Conclusions BST-CarGel® was shown to be an effective mid-term cartilage repair treatment. At 5 years, BST-CarGel® treatment resulted in sustained and significantly superior repair tissue quantity and quality over microfracture alone. Clinical benefit following BST-CarGel® and microfracture treatment were highly significant over baseline levels.",1

A prospective trial was designed to compare the biomembrane cover after microfracture with conventional microfracture among patients with grade III-IV symptomatic cartilage defect in the knee joint. Patients aged 18-60 years were assigned to either the microfracture/biomembrane (n = 45) or microfracture groups (n = 19). Among them, 24 knees in the microfracture/biomembrane and 12 knees in the microfracture were followed up for 2 years. Cartilage repair was assessed with magnetic resonance imagings taken 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively, and the clinical outcomes were also recorded. Compared with conventional microfracture, microfracture/biomembrane resulted in greater degree of cartilage repair (p = 0.043). In the intra-group analysis, while microfracture showed moderate to good degree of cartilage repair in nearly 50 % of the patients (47 % at 6 months to 50 % at 2 years; n.s.), microfracture/biomembrane maintained an equivalent degree of repair up to 2 years (88 % at 6 months to 75 % at 2 years; n.s.). The clinical outcome at 2 years also showed improved knee score and satisfaction and decreased pain in each group, but the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. Compared with conventional microfracture, biomembrane cover after microfracture yielded superior outcome in terms of the degree of cartilage repair during 2 years of follow-up. This implies that initial protection of blood clot and immature repair tissue at the microfractured defect is important for the promotion of enhanced cartilage repair, which may be obtained by the application of a biomembrane.

Purpose: This study was undertaken to evaluate the 5-year clinical outcome of CCI in a randomized comparison with MF for the treatment of symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyles of the knee. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Participants aged 18 to 50 years with a symptomatic isolated International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade III or IV cartilage lesion of the femoral condyles between 1 and 5 cm 2 were randomized to either CCI or MF. Clinical outcomes were measured up to 60 months after surgery using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The main outcome parameter was change from baseline in overall KOOS (oKOOS). Adverse events were monitored. Results: Fifty-one participants were treated with CCI and 61 with MF. On average, clinical benefit was maintained through the 60-month follow-up period. The average change from baseline in oKOOS was not different between both groups (least squares [LS] mean ± standard error [SE] 18.84 ± 3.58 for CCI vs 13.21 ± 5.63 for MF; P = .116). Treatment failures were comparable (n = 7 in CCI vs n = 10 in MF), although MF failures tended to occur earlier. Subgroup analysis revealed that CCI resulted in better outcome in participants with time since symptom onset of less than 3 years, which was statistically significant and clinically relevant (change in oKOOS &lt;3 years mean ± SE 25.96 ± 3.45 for CCI vs 15.28 ± 3.17 for MF; P = .026 vs oKOOS &gt;3 years mean ± SE 13.09 ± 4.78 for CCI vs 17.02 ± 4.50 for MF, P = .554). Other subgroup analyses such as age (cutoff 35 years) did not show a difference. Female patients showed more failures irrespective of treatment. Conclusion: At 5 years after treatment, clinical outcomes for CCI and MF were comparable. In the early treatment group, CCI obtained statistically significant and clinically relevant better results than MF. Delayed treatment resulted in less predictable outcomes for CCI. These results provide strong evidence that time since onset of symptoms is an essential variable that should be taken into account in future treatment algorithms for cartilage repair of the knee.",1

Purpose: To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of MACI versus MFX in the treatment of patients with symptomatic cartilage defects of the knee. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients enrolled in the SUMMIT (Demonstrate the Superiority of MACI implant to Microfracture Treatment) trial had ≥1 symptomatic focal cartilage defect (Outerbridge grade III or IV; ≥3 cm 2 ) of the femoral condyles or trochlea, with a baseline Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain value &lt;55. The co–primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the KOOS pain and function subscores from baseline to 2 years. Histological evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments of structural repair tissue, treatment failure, the remaining 3 KOOS subscales, and safety were also assessed. Results: Of the 144 patients treated, 137 (95%) completed the 2-year assessment. Patients had a mean age of 33.8 years and a mean lesion size of 4.8 cm 2 . The mean KOOS pain and function subscores from baseline to 2 years were significantly more improved with MACI than with MFX (pain: MACI, 37.0 to 82.5 vs MFX, 35.5 to 70.9; function: MACI, 14.9 to 60.9 vs MFX, 12.6 to 48.7; P = .001). A significant improvement in scores was also observed on the KOOS subscales of activities of daily living (MACI, 43.5 to 87.2 vs MFX, 42.6 to 75.8; P &lt; .001), knee-related quality of life (MACI, 18.8 to 56.2 vs MFX, 17.2 to 47.3; P = .029), and other symptoms (MACI, 48.3 to 83.7 vs MFX, 44.4 to 72.2; P &lt; .001) for patients treated with MACI compared with MFX. Repair tissue quality was good as assessed by histology/MRI, but no difference was shown between treatments. A low number of treatment failures (nonresponders: MACI, 12.5% vs MFX, 31.9%; P = .016) and no unexpected safety findings were reported. Conclusion: The treatment of symptomatic cartilage knee defects ≥3 cm 2 in size using MACI was clinically and statistically significantly better than with MFX, with similar structural repair tissue and safety, in this heterogeneous patient population. Moreover, MACI offers a more efficacious alternative than MFX with a similar safety profile for the treatment of symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the knee.",1

Methods 10 men and 30 women aged 22 to 56 (mean, 37.4) years underwent microfracture (n=20) or carbon fibre rod implantation (n=20) for International Cartilage Repair Society grade 3 to 4 knee articular cartilage lesions after a mean of 12.2 months of viscosupplementation and physiotherapy. Clinical outcome at 6 and 12 months was assessed using the Tegner-Lysholm score and modified Cincinnati score. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcome at 12 months was assessed by a radiologist. The modified magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score was evaluated. Results The 2 groups were comparable in terms of age, body mass index, lesion location, lesion size, duration of symptoms, and coexisting pathology. The microfracture group had a higher preoperative Tegner-Lysholm score (39.4±7.3 vs. 34.4±4.9, p=0.015) and modified Cincinnati score (36.4±7.2 vs. 30.4±4.0, p=0.002) than the carbon fibre rod group. At 12 months, change in both scores was significant within each group (p&lt;0.001) and was higher in the microfracture than carbon fibre rod group (p&lt;0.001). MRI showed minimal regenerative tissue. Lobulation, oedema, and hypertrophy were more commonly found in the regeneration tissue after carbon fibre rod implantation than microfracture. At 12 months, the MOCART score was higher in the microfracture than carbon fibre rod group (59 vs. 47, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion Microfracture is superior to carbon fibre rod implantation in terms of clinical and radiological outcome.",1

Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose was to compare the clinical outcome of microfracture versus mosaicplasty/osteochondral autograft transfer in symptomatic cartilage lesions. The null hypothesis was that the outcome was not statistically different at any point of time. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Forty patients with articular cartilage defects were randomized to undergo cartilage repair by either microfracture (n = 20) or mosaicplasty (n = 20). Inclusion criteria were as follows: age 18 to 50 years at the time of surgery, 1 or 2 symptomatic focal full-thickness articular chondral defects on the femoral condyles or trochlea, and size 2 to 6 cm 2 . The main outcome variable was the Lysholm knee score recorded before the surgery and at 12 months, median 5 years, median 10 years, and minimum 15 years after the surgery. Results: Forty patients were included in the study (28 men, 12 women; median age, 32 years; range, 18-48 years). Defects with a median size of 3.5 cm 2 (range, 2-5 cm 2 ) were treated. A significant increase in the Lysholm score was seen for all subjects— from a mean 53 (SD, 16) at baseline to 69 (SD, 21) at the minimum 15-year follow-up ( P = .001). The mean Lysholm score was significantly higher in the mosaicplasty group than the microfracture group at 12 months, median 5 years, median 10 years, and minimum 15 years: 77 (SD, 17) versus 61 (SD, 22), respectively ( P = .01), at the last follow-up. At all follow-up time points, the difference in mean Lysholm score was clinically significant (&gt;10 points).

While safety and promising results have been suggested, there are no trials proving the real potential of the osteochondral regenerative approach. Aim was to assess the benefit provided by a nanostructured collagen-hydroxyapatite (coll-HA) multilayer scaffold for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral knee lesions.In this multicentre randomized controlled clinical trial, 100 patients affected by symptomatic chondral and osteochondral lesions were treated and evaluated for up to 2 years (51 study group and 49 control group). A biomimetic coll-HA scaffold was studied, and bone marrow stimulation (BMS) was used as reference intervention. Primary efficacy measurement was IKDC subjective score at 2 years. Secondary efficacy measurements were: KOOS, IKDC Knee Examination Form, Tegner and VAS Pain scores evaluated at 6, 12 and 24 months. Tissue regeneration was evaluated with MRI MOCART scoring system at 6, 12 and 24 months. An external independent agency was involved to ensure data correctness and objectiveness.A statistically significant improvement of all clinical scores was obtained from basal evaluation to 2-year follow-up in both groups, although no overall statistically significant differences were detected between the two treatments. Conversely, the subgroup of patients affected by deep osteochondral lesions (i.e. Outerbridge grade IV and OCD) showed a statistically significant better IKDC subjective outcome (+12.4 points, p = 0.036) in the coll-HA group. Statistically significant better results were also found for another challenging group: sport active patients (+16.0, p = 0.027). Severe adverse events related to treatment were documented only in three patients in the coll-HA group and in one in the BMS group. The MOCART score showed no statistical difference between the two groups.This study highlighted the safety and potential of a biomimetic implant. While no statistically significant differences were found compared to BMS for chondral lesions, this procedure can be considered a suitable option for the treatment of osteochondral lesions.I.",1

METHODS: All subjects (n = 86) who had been treated with knee joint ACI-P or microfracture (n = 76) with a post-operative follow-up of at least ten years were selected. Clinical pre- and post-operative outcomes were analyzed by numeric analog scale (NAS) for pain, Lysholm, Tegner, IKDC, and KOOS score. Radiographical evaluation was visualized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Assessment of the regenerate quality was performed by the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) and modified knee osteoarthritis scoring system (mKOSS). Relaxation time (RT) of T2 maps enabled a microstructural cartilage analysis. RESULTS: MFX and ACI of 44 patients (24 females, 20 males; mean age 38.9 ± 12.1 years) resulted in a good long-term outcome with low pain scores and significant improved clinical scores. The final Lysholm and functional NAS scores were significantly higher in the MFX group (Lysholm: MFX 82 ± 15 vs. ACI-P 71 ± 18 p = 0.027; NAS function: MFX 8.1 ± 3.5 vs. ACI-P 6.0 ± 2.5; p = 0.003). The MOCART score did not show any qualitative differences. KOSS analysis demonstrated that cartilage repair of small defects resulted in a significant better outcome. T2-relaxation times were without difference between groups at the region of the regenerate tissue. CONCLUSION: This study did not demonstrate coherent statistical differences between both cartilage repair procedures. MFX might be superior in the treatment of small cartilage defects.",1

Follow-up data were also collected at 12, 54, and 108 weeks after surgery and included patient-reported clinical scores: visual analog scale for pain, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee score, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey.MRI scans confirmed cartilage repair tissue formation in both groups 12 weeks after treatment. There was no significant difference between the m-BMS and MF groups in the percentage of defect filling at 12, 54, and 108 weeks postoperatively. No significant difference was found in terms of patient-reported clinical scores. Both groups showed significant improvement in 4 KOOS subscales-Pain, Activities of Daily Living, Sport and Recreation, and Quality of Life-at 54 and 108 weeks after treatment.This is the first randomized controlled trial comparing m-BMS with a polyglycolic acid matrix with hyaluronan with MF. The use of the Chondrotissue implant in m-BMS has been proven to be a safe procedure. No difference was found between m-BMS and MF in terms of patient-reported outcome scores and MRI assessment until postoperative 2 years. Long-term follow-up studies including histological assessment are desirable for further investigation.EUCTR2011-003594-28-DE (EU Clinical Trials Register).",1

Evidence for the variety of surgical treatments available is inconclusive. This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with symptomatic cartilage defects treated with matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI or microfracture (MF). Included patients were >or= 18 and <or= 50 years of age with symptomatic, post-traumatic, single, isolated chondral defects (4-10 cm2) and were randomised to receive MACI or MF. Patients were followed up 8-12, 22-26 and 50-54 weeks post-operatively for efficacy and safety evaluation. Outcome measures were the Tegner, Lysholm and ICRS scores. Sixty patients were included in a randomised study (40 MACI, 20 MF). The difference between baseline and 24 months post-operatively for both treatment groups was significant for the Lysholm, Tegner, patient ICRS and surgeon ICRS scores (all P < 0.0001). However, MACI was significantly more effective over time (24 months versus baseline) than MF according to the Lysholm (P = 0.005), Tegner (P = 0.04), ICRS patient (P = 0.03) and ICRS surgeon (P = 0.02) scores. There were no safety issues related to MACI or MF during the study. MACI is superior to MF in the treatment of articular defects over 2 years. MACI and MF are complementary procedures, depending on the size of the defect and symptom recurrence. The MACI technique represents a significant advance over both first and second generation chondrocyte-based cartilage repair techniques for surgeons, patients, health care institutions and payers in terms of reproducibility, safety, intraoperative time, surgical simplicity and reduced invasiveness.",1

Purpose: To evaluate short-term clinicoradiological outcomes of patients treated arthroscopically for acetabular chondral defects with CarGel in conjunction with MF compared with those treated with MF alone. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: All patients who underwent hip arthroscopy and received MF with or without CarGel for acetabular chondral defects between 2014 and 2018 with a minimum 2-year clinicoradiological follow-up were included. Intraoperative details, postoperative complications, and clinical outcome scores, including the international Hip Outcome Tool–33 (iHOT-33), Hip Outcome Score (HOS)–Activities of Daily Living (HOS-ADL), and Hip Outcome Score–Sports Profile, were analyzed. Serial plain radiographs were assessed independently by 2 blinded observers. A survival analysis was performed to identify the number of cases converted to total hip arthroplasty (THA) in both groups, which was correlated with the cartilage defect size at the time of surgery. Results: Eighty patients (54 CarGel and 26 MF) were evaluated, including 56 men (70%) and 48 right hips (60%). Three patients were lost to follow-up. There were no major adverse events in either group. The average defect size was 3.63 and 4.97 cm 2 in MF and CarGel, respectively ( P = .002). There was a statistically significant improvement in iHOT-33 (from 43.24 to 60.17 in MF and from 41.13 to 58.39 in CarGel) and HOS-ADL (from 62.25 to 76.75 in MF and from 44.69 to 79.16 in CarGel) scores. There was no difference between the 2 groups in the outcome scores after adjusting for covariates. Survival analysis showed 34.6% of MF cases and 5.9% of CarGel cases were converted to THA ( P = .001). The mean defect size of the failure group was higher in CarGel than in MF (8.83 and 3.72 cm 2 , respectively). Mean joint space reduction was 1.41 mm in MF and 0.19 mm in CarGel ( P &lt; .001). Conclusion: Two-year clinicoradiological results were promising in these lesions that are difficult to treat. Arthroscopic treatment of chondral acetabular defects with CarGel demonstrated a significant decrease in progressive loss of joint space and conversion to THA compared with MF as an isolated procedure.",1

Inadequate healing in areas of weight bearing leads to impairment in load transmission and these defects predispose to later development of osteoarthritis. Surgical management of full thickness chondral defects include arthroscopic microfracture and when appropriate autologous chondrocyte implantation. This latter method however is technically challenging, and may not offer significant improvement over microfracture. Preclinical and limited clinical trials have indicated the capacity of mesenchymal stem cells to influence chondral repair. The aim of this paper is to describe the methodology of a pilot randomised controlled trial comparing arthroscopic microfracture alone for isolated knee chondral defects versus arthroscopic microfracture combined with postoperative autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell injections.A pilot single-centre randomised controlled trial is proposed. 40 participants aged 18-50 years, with isolated femoral condyle chondral defects and awaiting planned arthroscopic microfracture will be randomly allocated to a control group (receiving no additional treatment) or treatment group (receiving postoperative adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell treatment). Primary outcome measures will include MRI assessment of cartilage volume and defects and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Secondary outcomes will include further MRI assessment of bone marrow lesions, bone area and T2 cartilage mapping, a 0-10 Numerical Pain Rating Scale, a Global Impression of Change score and a treatment satisfaction scale. Adverse events and cointerventions will be recorded. Initial outcome follow-up for publication of results will be at 12 months. Further annual follow-up to assess long-term differences between the two group will occur.This trial has received prospective ethics approval through the Latrobe University Human Research Ethics Committee. Dissemination of outcome data is planned through both national and international conferences and formal publication in a peer-reviewed journal.Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ANZCTR Trial ID: ACTRN12614000812695).",1

Purpose To compare the clinical outcome of patients treated with second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation implants with those treated with the microfracture repair technique at 5-year follow-up. Study Design Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods Eighty active patients (mean age, 29.8 years) and grade III to IV cartilage lesions of the femoral condyles or trochlea were treated with arthroscopic second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation Hyalograft C or microfracture (40 patients per group). Patients achieved a minimum 5-year follow-up and were prospectively evaluated. Results Both groups showed statistically significant improvement of all clinical scores from preoperative interval to 5-year follow-up. There was a significant improvement for the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score from preoperative to 5-year follow-up (Wilcoxon test, P &lt; .001). In the microfracture group, the International Knee Documentation Committee objective score increased from 2.5% normal and nearly normal knees before the operation to 75% normal and nearly normal knees at 5-year follow-up, and the subjective score increased from 41.1 ± 12.3 preoperatively to 70.2 ± 14.7 at 5-year follow-up. In the group treated with Hyalograft C, the International Knee Documentation Committee objective score increased from 15% normal and nearly normal knees before the operation to 90% normal and nearly normal knees at 5-year follow-up, and its subjective score increased from 40.5 ± 15.2 preoperatively to 80.2 ± 19.1 at 5-year follow-up (Wilcoxon test, P &lt; .001). When comparing the groups, better improvement of the International Knee Documentation Committee objective (P &lt; .001) and subjective (P = .003) scores was observed in the Hyalograft C group at 5-year follow-up. The return to sports at 2 years was similar in both groups and remained stable after 5 years in the Hyalograft C group; it worsened in the microfracture group. Conclusion Both methods have shown satisfactory clinical outcome at medium-term follow-up. Better clinical results and sport activity resumption were noted in the group treated with second-generation autologous chondrocyte transplantation.",1

Articular cartilage lesions are difficult to treat, and the increased mechanical stress produced by this sport makes their management even more complex. Hypothesis: To evaluate whether the regenerative cell-based approach allows these highly demanding athletes a better functional recovery compared with the bone marrow stimulation approach. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Forty-one professional or semiprofessional male soccer players were treated from 2000 to 2006 and evaluated prospectively at 2 years and at a final 7.5-year mean follow-up (minimum, 4 years). Twenty-one patients were treated with arthroscopic second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (Hyalograft C) and 20 with the microfracture technique. The clinical outcome of all patients was analyzed using the cartilage standard International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) evaluation package. The sport activity level was evaluated with the Tegner score, and the recovery time was also recorded. Results: A significant improvement in all clinical scores from preoperative to final follow-up was found in both groups. The percentage of patients who returned to competition was similar: 80% in the microfracture group and 86% in the Hyalograft C group. Patients treated with microfracture needed a median of 8 months before playing their first official soccer game, whereas the Hyalograft C group required a median time of 12.5 months ( P = .009). The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score showed similar results at 2 years’ follow-up but significantly better results in the Hyalograft C group at the final evaluation ( P = .005). In fact, in the microfracture group, results decreased over time (from 86.8 ± 9.7 to 79.0 ± 11.6, P &lt; .0005), whereas the Hyalograft C group presented a more durable outcome with stable results (90.5 ± 12.8 at 2 years and 91.0 ± 13.9 at the final follow-up). Conclusion: Despite similar success in returning to competitive sport, microfracture allows a faster recovery but present a clinical deterioration over time, whereas arthroscopic second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation delays the return of high-level male soccer players to competition but can offer more durable clinical results.",1

As a surgical graft, Kartigen® was implanted onto the cartilage defects at the weight-bearing site of the medial femoral condyle of the knee. Fifteen patients were enrolled and stratified into two groups, undergoing either Kartigen® implantation (n = 10) or microfracture (control group, n = 5). The primary endpoint was to evaluate the safety of Kartigen® by monitoring the occurrence of adverse events through physician queries, physical examinations, laboratory tests, and radiological analyses for 2 years. There were no infections, inflammations, adhesions, loose body, or tumor formations in the Kartigen®-implanted knees. The preliminary efficacy was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, visual analog scale, and second-look arthroscopy. The postoperative IKDC scores of the Kartigen® group significantly improved in the 16th week (IKDC = 62.1 ± 12.8, p = 0.025), kept increasing in the first year (IKDC = 78.2 ± 15.4, p &lt; 0.005), and remained satisfactory in the second year (IKDC = 73.6 ± 13.8, p &lt; 0.005), compared to the preoperative condition (IKDC = 47.1 ± 17.0), while the postoperative IKDC scores of the control group also achieved significant improvement in the 28th week (IKDC = 68.5 ± 6.1, p = 0.032) versus preoperative state (IKDC = 54.0 ± 9.1). However, the IKDC scores decreased in the first year (IKDC = 63.5 ± 11.6) as well as in the second year (IKDC = 52.6 ± 16.4). Thirteen patients underwent second-look arthroscopy and biopsy one year after the operation. The Kartigen® group exhibited integration between Kartigen® and host tissue with a smooth appearance at the recipient site, whereas the microfracture group showed fibrillated surfaces. The histological and immunohistochemical analyses of biopsy specimens demonstrated the columnar structure of articular cartilage and existence of collagen type II and glycosaminoglycan mimic hyaline cartilage. This study indicates that Kartigen® is safe and effective in treating cartilage defects.",1

Methods From January 2005 to December 2010, 37 patients with patellofemoral chondral lesions were prospectively followed up, for a minimum of 3 years; 19 of these patients were treated with MACI and 18 with BMAC. Radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical scores (International Knee Documentation Committee, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, visual analog scale, and Tegner) were collected preoperatively, at 2-year and final follow-up. Five patients of MACI and 6 of the BMAC group underwent second-look arthroscopy; 4 patients of each group consented to a concomitant biopsy. Results No adverse reactions or postoperative infections were noted. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups ( P &gt; 0.05). Both groups showed significant improvement in all scores, from preoperative to final follow-up ( P = 0.001), but there was no significant difference in improvement between the 2 groups, except for the IKDC subjective score ( P = 0.015), which favored the BMAC group. Deterioration in MACI and improvement in BMAC group scores were noticed, from 2-year to final follow-up, but was nonsignificant. MACI patients with trochlear lesions showed better results than patellar lesions, while location was not a prognostic factor in the BMAC group. MRI showed complete filling of the defects in 76% of patients in MACI and 81% of patients in BMAC, and histological analysis revealed hyaline-like features. Conclusion Both techniques are viable and effective for large patellofemoral chondral lesions at minimum 3-year follow-up.",1

A wide variety of methods involving mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been introduced. Because of the limitation of the results, most of the treatment methods have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) and human umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) implantation were approved by Korea FDA. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes after two different types of MSCs implantation in knee osteoarthritis. Fifty-two patients (52 knees) who underwent cartilage repair surgery using the BMAC (25 knees) and hUCB-MSCs (27 knees) were retrospectively evaluated for 2 years after surgery. Clinical outcomes were evaluated according to the score of visual analogue scale (VAS), the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Cartilage repair was assessed according to the modified Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (M-MOCART) score and the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) cartilage repair scoring system. At 2-year follow-up, clinical outcomes including VAS, IKDC, and KOOS significantly improved ( P &lt; 0.05) in both groups; however, there were no differences between two groups. There was no significant difference in M-MOCART [1-year ( P = 0.261), 2-year ( P = 0.351)] and ICRS repair score ( P = 0.655) between two groups. Both groups showed satisfactory clinical and MRI outcomes. Implantation of MSCs from BMAC or hUCB-MSCs is safe and effective for repairing cartilage lesion. However, large cases and a well-controlled prospective design with long-term follow-up studies are needed.",1
513,https://openalex.org/W320698679,,Autologous chondrocyte implantation: a comparison between an open periosteal-covered and an arthroscopic matrix-guided technique.,"In this prospective study, the authors compared the Carticel method of autologous chondrocyte implantation with the Hyalograft C technique. The aim of the study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two methods, to identify any complications and to analyse MRI images of the repair process. Seventeen patients who had received autologous chondrocyte implantation with the Carticel technique and ten treated with Hyalograft C were assessed. A statistically significant improvement was observed in both groups at six months (p < 0.001 for Carticel and p = 0.002 for Hyalograft C) and at twelve months after surgery (p < 0.001 both for Carticel and Hyalograft C), according to HSS (Hospital for Special Surgery) and ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) scores. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. MRI images obtained one year after surgery revealed the formation of well-integrated tissue similar to the surrounding healthy cartilage in most cases, in both Carticel and Hyalograft C groups. Six patients treated with Carticel technique were also assessed by second-look arthroscopy and histology of biopsies. The newly-formed tissue presented structural features similar to normal cartilage in most cases (84%). Molecular analysis was performed to assess mRNA levels of the various collagen molecules and proliferation and differentiation factors: the results showed that the implanted material undergoes progressive remodelling to regenerate hyaline cartilage. Both Carticel and Hyalograft C implantation techniques seem to lead to comparable short- and medium-term results. Moreover, this study confirmed that MRI is a valid tool in the follow-up evaluation of autologous chondrocyte implantation.",1

Hypothesis: A significant improvement will exist in clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–based scoring measures to 5 years after surgery. Furthermore, there will be no significant differences in outcomes in MACI patients at 5 years when comparing a traditional and an accelerated postoperative weightbearing regimen. Finally, patient demographics, cartilage defect parameters, and injury/surgery history will be associated with graft outcome. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Clinical and radiological outcomes were studied in 70 patients who underwent MACI to the medial or lateral femoral condyle, in conjunction with either an “accelerated” or a “traditional” approach to postoperative weightbearing rehabilitation. Under the accelerated protocol, patients reached full weightbearing at 8 weeks after surgery, compared with 11 weeks for the traditional group. Clinical measures (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36], visual analog scale [VAS], 6-minute walk test, and knee range of motion) were assessed before surgery and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months and 5 years after surgery. High-resolution MRI was undertaken at 3, 12, and 24 months and 5 years after surgery and assessed 8 previously defined pertinent parameters of graft repair as well as a combined MRI composite score. The association between clinical and MRI-based outcomes, patient demographics, chondral defect parameters, and injury/surgery history was investigated. Results: Of the 70 patients recruited, 63 (31 accelerated, 32 traditional) underwent clinical follow-up at 5 years; 58 (29 accelerated, 29 traditional) also underwent radiological assessment. A significant time effect ( P &lt; .05) was demonstrated for all clinical and MRI-based scores over the 5-year period. While the VAS demonstrated significantly less frequent pain at 5 years in the accelerated group, there were no other significant differences between the 2 groups. Between 24 months and 5 years, a significant improvement ( P &lt; .05) in both groups was observed for the sport and recreation subscale of the KOOS as well as a significant decrease ( P &lt; .05) in active knee extension for the traditional group. There were no significant differences ( P &gt; .05) in the MRI-based scores between 24 months and 5 years after surgery. Patient age and defect size exhibited significant negative correlations ( P &lt; .05) with several MRI-based outcomes at 5 years, while there were no significant correlations ( P &gt; .05) between clinical and MRI-based outcomes. At 5 years after surgery, 94% and 95% were satisfied with the ability of MACI to relieve their knee pain and improve their ability to undertake daily activities, respectively. Conclusion: The outcomes of this randomized trial demonstrate a safe and effective accelerated rehabilitation protocol as well as a regimen that provides comparable, if not superior, clinical outcomes to patients throughout the postoperative timeline.",1

Both rehabilitation interventions sought to protect the implant for an initial period, then incrementally increase load bearing. Under the ‘accelerated' protocol, patients reached full weight bearing at 8 weeks post-surgery, compared to 11 weeks for the ‘traditional' group. <h3>Results</h3> Patients in the ‘accelerated' group achieved greater 6min walk distances and daily activity levels as measured by accelerometry (<i>P</i><0.05) compared to the ‘traditional' group. Furthermore, the ‘accelerated' group reported significantly better improvement in knee pain at 12 weeks as indicated by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (<i>P</i><0.05), and regardless of the rehabilitation protocol employed, no patient suffered any adverse effect to the implant as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging at 3 months. Comparison of each rehabilitation group with an unaffected control group revealed a significant difference in peak knee adduction and flexion moments for the traditional group (<i>P</i><0.05). However, there was no difference for accelerated patients (<i>P</i>>0.05), which may demonstrate a faster return to knee loading patterns typically observed in unaffected subjects. <h3>Conclusion</h3> The ‘accelerated' load bearing approach that reduced the length of time spent ambulating on crutches resulted in reduced knee pain, improved function, no graft complications and may speed up the recovery of normal gait function.

Hypothesis A comprehensive protocol after MACI on the femoral condyle with accelerated weightbearing leads to a better functional and radiographic outcome compared with the same comprehensive protocol with delayed weightbearing. Study Design Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods Thirty-one patients (22 male, 9 female) after MACI on the femoral condyle were randomly assigned to the accelerated weightbearing group (group A) or the delayed weightbearing group (group B). Aside from increase and time of full weightbearing, both groups adhered to the same rehabilitation protocol and exercises. Patients were assessed preoperatively and at 4, 12, 24, 52, and 104 weeks after surgery. Clinical evaluation was performed by determining the subjective form of the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), the Tegner activity scale, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Radiological outcome was evaluated by the MOCART score and the size and amount of bone marrow edema and effusion. Results In both groups, there were no differences with regard to the clinical outcome.

Although no differences (P > .05) were observed between the 2 groups for active knee ROM, the AR group did achieve full active knee extension as early as 4 weeks compared with the CR group at 12 weeks. There was no difference (P > .05) in graft quality as assessed by MRI (MOCART composite score: AR, 3.34; CR, 3.04), with no patients suffering any adverse effects from the implant up to 12 months, regardless of the rehabilitation protocol employed.The AR approach that reduced the length of time spent ambulating on crutches resulted in improved general physical function and quality of life and an earlier attainment of full active knee extension when compared with the CR approach. There were no graft complications ascertained through MRI. This regimen appears safe and may potentially speed up the recovery of normal gait function. A larger patient cohort and follow-up are required to observe long-term graft outcomes.",1

Postoperatively, the time required to attain full weightbearing (WB) remains conservative. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that patients would have no significant clinical or radiological differences or graft complications after an 8-week or 6-week return to full WB after MACI. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 37 knees (n = 35 patients) were randomly allocated to either an 8-week return to full WB that we considered current best practice based on the existing literature (CR group; n = 19 knees) or an accelerated 6-week WB approach (AR group; n = 18 knees). Patients were evaluated preoperatively and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery, using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, visual analog pain scale, 6-minute walk test, and active knee range of motion. Isokinetic dynamometry was used to assess peak knee extension and flexion strength and limb symmetry indices (LSIs) between the operated and nonoperated limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken to evaluate the quality and quantity of repair tissue as well as to calculate an MRI composite score. Results: Significant improvements ( P &lt; .05) were observed in all subjective scores, active knee flexion and extension, 6-minute capacity, peak knee extensor torque in the operated limb, and knee extensor LSI, although no group differences existed. Although knee flexor LSIs were above 100% for both groups at 12 and 24 months after surgery, LSIs for knee extensor torque at 24 months were 93.7% and 87.5% for the AR and CR groups, respectively. The MRI composite score and pertinent graft parameters significantly improved over time ( P &lt; .05), with some superior in the AR group at 24 months. All patients in the AR group (100%) demonstrated good to excellent infill at 24 months, compared with 83% of patients in the CR group. Two cases of graft failure were observed, both in the CR group. At 24 months, 83% of patients in the CR group and 88% in the AR group were satisfied with the results of their MACI surgery. Conclusion: Patients in the AR group who reduced the length of time spent ambulating on crutches produced comparable outcomes up to 24 months, without compromising graft integrity.",1

To date, there has been no randomized clinical trial involving Hydrogel (Cartiva (TM)). This study evaluated and compared the results of a hydrogel implant (Cartiva (TM)) with autologous osteochondral transplantation (AOT) for treating knee joint focal cartilage lesions. Methods Thirty-eight symptomatic patients, with a focal cartilage lesion of Outerbridge grades III or IV, were randomized into one of two groups according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Group I underwent AOT, and Group II was treated with a Hydrogel implant. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and again postoperatively at 6, 12, and 24 months using the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS Pain), Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS) and Lysholm score. Results Both groups showed significant improvements from baseline (pre-surgery) to post-surgery (6, 12, and 24 months; p \textbackslashtextless 0.05), but there was no difference between the groups. Regarding complications, prolonged pain was observed in four patients (10.5%), two from each group, with a regression of symptoms within 1 year. Conclusion The Hydrogel implant showed similar efficiency as the autologous osteochondral graft for treating knee joint focal cartilage lesions. Both techniques showed satisfactory results compared to preoperative status. The Hydrogel implant was safe and effective, and it provided good stability and joint function at 2-year follow-up.",1

Various surgical treatment options are available, however no statistically significant differences have been found between the different surgical treatments. This supports the suggestion that the improvement might be a result of the post-operative rehabilitation rather than the surgery itself. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has become a recognized treatment option for larger cartilage lesions in the knee. Although ACI has been compared to other surgical treatment such as microfracture and mosaicplasty, it has never been directly compared to simple arthroscopic debridement and rehabilitation alone. In this study we want to increase clinical and economic knowledge about autologous chondrocyte implantation compared to arthroscopic debridement and physical rehabilitation in the short and long run.We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare ACI with simple arthroscopic debridement (AD) and physiotherapy for the treatment of cartilage lesions in the knee. The study will include a total of 82 patients, both men and non-pregnant women, with a full thickness cartilage defect in the weight bearing area of the femoral condyles or trochlea larger than 2 cm2. The lesion must be symptomatic, with a Lysholm score less than 75. The two treatment groups will receive identical rehabilitation protocol according to a modification of Wondrasch et al., which is an active rehabilitation and education program divided into 3 phases: accommodation, rehabilitation and return to activity. The patients will be followed for 24 months, with additional late follow-ups at 5 and 10 years to monitor the potential onset of osteoarthtitis. The primary outcome measure will be the difference in the KOOS knee-related quality of life (QoL) subscore in the ACI group compared to the AD group at 2 years. A combination of self-explanatory questionnaires, clinical parameters, clinical hop tests and radiographs and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used as secondary endpoints.This is the first study with a high level of evidence to compare ACI with simple debridement and physiotherapy for the treatment of isolated symptomatic full thickness lesions of the knee.ClinicalTrial NCT02636881 (21 December 2015).",1

The procedure is perceived as invasive and technically challenging, presenting barriers to more widespread adoption. Purpose/Hypothesis: The objective of this study was to investigate whether outcomes and the failure rate of a simplified ACI technique (cs-ACI) were comparable with those of the more complicated traditional technique of a chondrocyte suspension injected under a collagen membrane (cACI). We hypothesized that the change in technique would not negatively affect outcomes. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Thirty-nine patients treated with the cs-ACI technique fulfilled the inclusion requirements. A group of 45 patients treated previously with standard cACI was used as a comparison. The functional outcomes were prospectively collected both preoperatively and postoperatively at the last follow-up. Failure was defined as any graft removal of more than 25% of the original defect size. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed postoperatively, and scans were assessed using a modified MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) scoring system. Results: Group demographics were not significantly different, except for the defect size and mean follow-up: 4.09 years in the cACI group and 2.46 years in the cs-ACI group. Significant improvements were seen in all outcome measures except the Tegner score from the preoperative baseline to the latest follow-up for both the cACI group (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] score, from 42.0 to 63.4; Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]–Pain subscore, from 58.7 to 77.1; Lysholm score, from 57.2 to 69.7; and Tegner score, from 3.5 to 4.2) and the cs-ACI group (IKDC score, from 45.6 to 68.0; KOOS-Pain subscore, from 66.6 to 84.7; Lysholm score, from 53.7 to 75.4; and Tegner score, from 3.2 to 3.8). No significant difference was found between the groups at the latest follow-up. The failure rate at 2 years was not significantly different, while the total failure rate over the entire study period was significantly lower in the cs-ACI group than the cACI group (5% vs 24%, respectively). The overall MOCART score was not significantly different between the groups. Conclusion: The treatment of full-thickness articular cartilage defects with a simplified cell-seeded ACI technique demonstrated no significant differences in the failure rate and patient-reported outcomes when compared with a standard technique utilizing interrupted sutures and the injection of a cell suspension under a collagen membrane.",1

METHODS: Thirty-five patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus who underwent arthroscopic microfracture were included and followed up for at least 9 months post-operatively. The patients were randomly divided into non-injection group (n = 17) who received treatment with microfracture surgery alone and injection group (n = 18) who also accepted intra-articular injection of HA post-operatively. Quantitative MRI was used to evaluate the cartilage repair after surgery. American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hind foot Scale scores and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. RESULTS: After operation, the MRI outcomes showed that the thickness index was higher (0.8 ± 0.1 vs. 0.7 ± 0.1) and the T2 index was lower (1.2 ± 0.1 vs. 1.4 ± 0.1) in the injection group than in the non-injection group (P \textbackslashtextless 0.01). As for the volumes of subchondral bone marrow oedema, there are no significant differences between groups (n.s.). Compared with the non-injection group, the AOFAS score and the VAS score yielded a higher level of improvement in injection group at final follow-up post-operatively (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic microfracture is a safe and effective procedure for osteochondral lesions of the talus. Intra-articular HA injection as an adjunct to arthroscopic microfracture might offer better functional recovery than microfracture alone. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.",1

A secondary aim was to analyze the association between physeal closure status and outcomes. Methods Consecutive patients aged 18 years or younger who underwent OCA transplantation with a minimum 2-year follow-up were identified from a prospectively collected database. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those aged 16 years or younger (group 1) and those aged 17 to 18 years (group 2). Outcomes included patient-reported outcomes (PROs), complications, reoperations, and cartilage revision surgery. Outcomes were compared between groups, and physeal status was analyzed as a prognostic indicator. Results A total of 36 patients met the inclusion criteria: 18 in group 1 and 18 in group 2. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of demographic characteristics, prior surgical procedures, and surgical details, including concomitant procedures. The mean overall follow-up period was 4.6 ± 2.5 years (range, 2-10.3 years), with no significant difference between the groups (P = .21). There were 10 reoperations (28.8%), 4 in group 1 and 6 in group 2 (P = .47). The overall time to reoperation was 2.8 years and did not significantly differ between groups (P = .75). The failure rate was 5.6%, with 1 patient in each group undergoing either graft debridement or revision OCA transplantation. All PROs were significantly improved postoperatively (P Conclusions OCA transplantation in adolescents results in significant PRO score improvement and a low failure rate, albeit reoperations are not uncommon. Patients with closed physes show greater PRO score improvement than those with open physes. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective comparative study.",1

The augmentation of OCA with bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) has been hypothesized to improve osseous incorporation of the implanted allograft. Purpose: To evaluate the effect of autogenous BMAC treatment on osseous integration at the graft-host bony interface after OCA. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A retrospective review of patients treated with OCA+BMAC or OCA alone for full-thickness chondral defects of the distal femur from March 2015 to December 2016 was conducted. Seventeen knees treated with OCA+BMAC and 16 knees treated with OCA alone underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the early postoperative phase (mean, 6 months). Eighteen knees treated with OCA+BMAC and 16 knees treated with OCA alone underwent MRI in the late postoperative phase (mean, 12 months). Bone, cartilage, and ancillary features on MRI were graded using the Osteochondral Allograft MRI Scoring System (OCAMRISS) by a musculoskeletal radiologist blinded to the patient’s history and treatment. Results: There were no significant differences in the demographics or lesion characteristics between treatment groups in either postoperative phase. In the early postoperative phase, the mean OCAMRISS bone score was 3.0 ± 0.7 and 3.3 ± 0.7 for the OCA+BMAC group and OCA alone group, respectively ( P = .76); 71% (OCA+BMAC) and 81% (OCA alone) of MRI scans demonstrated discernible clefts at the graft-host junction ( P = .69), and 41% (OCA+BMAC) and 25% (OCA alone) of MRI scans demonstrated cystic changes at the graft and graft-host junction ( P = .46). In the late postoperative phase, the mean OCAMRISS bone score was 2.7 ± 0.8 and 2.9 ± 0.8 for the OCA+BMAC group and OCA alone group, respectively ( P = .97); 44% (OCA+BMAC) and 63% (OCA alone) of MRI scans demonstrated discernible clefts at the graft-host junction ( P = .33), and 50% (OCA+BMAC) and 31% (OCA alone) of MRI scans demonstrated the presence of cystic changes at the graft and graft-host junction ( P = .32). The mean OCAMRISS cartilage, ancillary, and total scores were not significantly different between groups in either postoperative phase. Conclusion: OCA augmented with BMAC was not associated with improved osseous integration; decreased cystic changes; or other bone, cartilage, and ancillary feature changes compared with OCA alone.",1

The aim of this study was to compare mosaicplasty and matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) at long-term follow-up. Forty-three patients were included: 20 mosaicplasty and 23 MACT. Patients were evaluated before and 12 years after surgery with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective and objective scores for symptoms and function, and with the Tegner score for activity level. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate repair tissue with the MOCART 2.0 score. Mosaicplasty and MACT showed good clinical and MRI results (IKDC subjective score 75.3 ± 21.8 and 81.8 ± 13.0, both p &lt; 0.0005). Mosaicplasty presented a 10% reoperation rate and a 25% overall failure rate, while no failures were documented in MACT (p = 0.016). While size did not influence the results in the MACT group, mosaicplasty presented lower IKDC objective and Tegner scores in lesions bigger than 2 cm2 (p = 0.031 and p = 0.014, respectively). Mosaicplasty and MACT presented both satisfactory clinical and MRI results at long-term follow-up. However, for larger lesions, MACT presented better subjective and objective outcomes, as well as less failures, which should be considered when choosing the most suitable treatment for patients affected by knee cartilage lesions.",1

There have been no comparative studies of the two techniques. This retrospective study assessed functional outcome of patients using the EQ-5D, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Modified Cincinnati scores at follow-up of 1-5 years. There were 66 patients in the study (35 TruFit and 31 Mosaicplasty): 44 males and 22 females with a mean age of 37.3 years (SD 12.6). The mean BMI was 26.8. Thirty-six articular cartilage lesions were due to trauma, twenty-six due to osteochondritis dissecans and three due to non-specific degenerative change or unknown. There was no difference between the two groups age (n.s.), sex (n.s.), BMI (n.s.), defect location (n.s.) or aetiology (n.s.). The median follow-up was 22 months for the TruFit cohort and 30 months for the mosaicplasty group. There was no significant difference in the requirement for re-operation (n.s). Patients undergoing autologous mosaicplasty had a higher rate of returning to sport (p = 0.006), lower EQ-5D pain scores (p = 0.048) and higher KOOS activities of daily living (p = 0.029) scores. Sub-group analysis showed no difference related to the number of cases the surgeon performed. Patients requiring re-operation had lower outcome scores regardless of their initial procedure. This study demonstrated significantly better outcomes using two validated outcome scores (KOOS, EQ-5D), and an ability to return to sport in those undergoing autologous mosaicplasty compared to those receiving TruFit plugs.

However, earlier studies suggested that chondrocyte implantation in the patellofemoral (PF) joint was less effective than in the tibiofemoral (TF) joint. Purpose: To compare the radiological and clinical outcomes of those undergoing MACI to either the femoral condyles or PF joint. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 194 patients were included in this analysis, including 127 undergoing MACI to the medial (n = 94) and lateral (n = 33) femoral condyle, as well as 67 to the patella (n = 35) or trochlea (n = 32). All patients were evaluated clinically (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], visual analog scale, Short Form–36) before surgery and at 3, 12, and 24 months after surgery, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken at 3, 12, and 24 months, with the MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) scoring system employed to evaluate the quality and quantity of repair tissue, as well as an MRI composite score. Patient satisfaction was evaluated. Results: No significant group differences ( P &gt; .05) were seen in demographics, defect size, prior injury, or surgical history, while the majority of clinical scores were similar preoperatively. All clinical scores significantly improved over time ( P &lt; .05), with a significant group effect observed for KOOS activities of daily living ( P = .008), quality of life ( P = .008), and sport ( P = .017), reflecting better postoperative scores in the TF group. While the PF group had significantly lower values at baseline for the KOOS activities of daily living and quality of life subscales, it actually displayed a similar net improvement over time compared with the TF group. At 24 months, 93.7% (n = 119) and 91.0% (n = 61) of patients were satisfied with the ability of MACI to relieve their knee pain, 74.0% (n = 94) and 65.7% (n = 44) with their ability to participate in sport, and 90.5% (n = 115) and 83.6% (n = 56) satisfied overall, in the TF and PF groups, respectively. MRI evaluation via the MOCART score revealed a significant time effect ( P &lt; .05) for the MRI composite score and graft infill over the 24-month period. While subchondral lamina scored significantly better ( P = .002) in the TF group, subchondral bone scored significantly worse ( P &lt; .001). At 24 months, the overall MRI composite score was classified as good/excellent in 98 TF patients (77%) and 54 PF patients (81%).

Purpose: To evaluate and compare the outcomes of mosaic-type osteochondral autologous transplantation (OAT) and microfracture (MF) procedures for the treatment of articular cartilage defects of the knee joint in young active athletes. This article represents an update of the clinical results at 10 years. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Between 1998 and 2002, a total of 60 athletes with a mean age of 24.3 years (range, 15-40 years) and with a symptomatic ACD or OCD in the knee were randomized to undergo either OAT or MF. Patients were then evaluated postoperatively using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score, Tegner activity score, radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging. The mean follow-up time was 10.4 years (range, 9-11 years). Results: Three to 10 years after the OAT and MF procedures, patients had lower ICRS and Tegner scores ( P &lt; .05), but both groups still had significant clinical improvement over presurgery scores according to ICRS scores at 10-year follow-up. Statistically significantly better results were detected in patients in the OAT group compared with those in the MF group at 10 years ( P &lt; .005). At 10-year follow-up, there were 15 failures (26%), including 4 failures (14%) of the OAT and 11 failures (38%) of MF treatment ( P &lt; .05).

Only those athletes playing in competitive sports at regional or national levels were included in the study. Fifty-seven athletes (95%) were available for a follow-up. There were 28 athletes in the OAT group and 29 athletes in the MF group. The mean duration of symptoms was 21.32 ± 5.57 months and the mean follow-up was 37.1 months (range, 36 to 38 months), and none of the athletes had prior surgical interventions to the affected knee. Patients were evaluated using modified Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) and International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scores, radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and clinical assessment. An independent observer performed a follow-up examination after 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. At 12.4 months postoperatively, arthroscopy with biopsy for histologic evaluation was carried out. A radiologist and a pathologist, both of whom were blinded to each patient's treatment, did the radiologic and histologic evaluations. <b>Results:</b> After 37.1 months, both groups had significant clinical improvement (<i>P</i> < .05). According to the modified HSS and ICRS scores, functional and objective assessment showed that 96% had excellent or good results after OAT compared with 52% for the MF procedure (<i>P</i> < .001). At 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery, the HSS and ICRS showed statistically significantly better results in the OAT group (<i>P</i> = .03; <i>P</i> = .006; <i>P</i> = .006). Younger athletes did better in both groups. No serious complications were reported. There was 1 failure in the OAT group and 9 in the MF group. The ICRS Cartilage Repair Assessment for macroscopic evaluation during arthroscopy at 12.4 months showed excellent or good repairs in 84% after OAT and in 57% after MF. Biopsy specimens were obtained from 58% of the patients and histologic evaluation of repair showed better scores (according to ICRS) for the OAT group (<i>P</i> < .05). MRI evaluation showed excellent or good repairs in 94% after OAT compared with 49% after MF. Twenty-six (93%) OAT patients and 15 (52%) MF patients returned to sports activities at the preinjury level at an average of 6.5 months (range, 4 to 8 months).

According to the modified HSS and ICRS scores, functional and objective assessment showed that 96% had excellent or good results after OAT compared with 52% after MF procedure (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001). In 12, 24 and 36 months after the operations, the HSS and ICRS showed statistically significantly better results in the OAT group (P=0.03; P=0.006; P=0.006). Twenty-six (93%) athletes following OAT and fifteen (52%) athletes following MF returned to sports activities at the preinjury level at an average of 6.5 months (range, 4-8 months) after the operations. At an average of 37.1 months follow-up, our prospective, randomized, clinical study in athletes has shown significant superiority of the OAT over MF for the repair of articular cartilage defects in the knee.",1

Only those children with grade 3 or 4 (OCD) in the medial or lateral femoral condyle (according to International Cartilage Repair Society, ICRS) were included in the study. Forty-seven patients (94%) were available for follow-up. There were 25 patients in the OAT group and 22 patients in the MF group. The mean duration of symptoms was 23.54+/-4.24 months and the mean follow-up was 4.2 years (range from 3 to 6 y), and none of the children had prior surgical interventions to the affected knee. Children were evaluated using ICRS score, x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and second-look arthroscopies.After 1 year, both groups had significant clinical improvement (P<0.05) and the ICRS functional and objective assessment showed that 23 of 25 (92%) patients had excellent or good results after OAT compared with 19 of 22 (86%) after MF (NS), but 19 of 23 (83%) after OAT and only 12 of 19 (63%) after MF procedure maintained excellent or good results after 4.2 years (range from 3 to 6 y). The MF group showed significant deterioration over the 4.2 years follow-up (P<0.05), but still had significant clinical improvement compared with pretreatment evaluation (P=0.004). There were 9 of 22 (41%) failures in the MF group, and none in the OAT group. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation according to the ICRS evaluation system showed excellent or good repairs in 19 of 21 patients (91%) after OAT compared with 10 of 18 (56%) after MF.At an average of 4.2 years follow-up, our prospective, randomized, clinical study in children under the age of 18 years has shown significant superiority of the mosaic-type OAT over MF for the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans defects in the knee. However, our study has shown that both MF and OAT give encouraging clinical results for children under the age of 18 years.Level 1: randomized controlled trial, significant difference.",1

The BIO and CAP groups were matched according to treatment location, defect grade and size, and age profile. Outcomes included Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Short Form-12, and satisfaction. The primary combination endpoint was determined as a 20% improvement (minimum clinically important difference-20) on WOMAC pain and function at 2 years and no additional index lesion-related surgical intervention. Safety and effectiveness were also reported.Thirty patients in the BIO group (mean age of 44.6, range 35-64) had an average follow-up of 2.6 years and 32 patients in the CAP group (mean age 47.9, range 37-68) were followed for 2.0 years. Fifty-three percent in the BIO group and 75% in the CAP group achieved success per the endpoint definition. The mean total WOMAC score improved significantly for both groups (BIO: 57-78; P < .001) (CAP: 41-86; P < .001). The physical component score (Short Form-12 PCS) improved significantly in the CAP group only (30-36.4; P < .001). Good to excellent patient satisfaction was achieved by 80% in BIO and 91% in CAP. There were 4 secondary procedures on the index lesion in the BIO group and 2 in the CAP group.Careful patient selection can achieve high satisfaction rates with both biological and focal metal resurfacing procedures for the treatment of isolated focal chondral lesions of the femoral condyle in the knee. Focal metallic resurfacing results in similar clinical outcomes and provides excellent success rates at short-term follow-up.Level III comparative study.",1

METHODS: Sixty-six New Zealand white rabbits were used. Bilateral knee joints from the same rabbit were randomly divided into experimental group and microfracture group. An articular cartilage defect was established in the femoral trochlear groove. In the experimental group, the defect was microfractured and covered with osteochondral paste harvested from the intercondylar notch. The regenerated tissues were harvested for gross morphology, histology, biochemistry and gene expression analysis at 4, 8 and 12 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS: The regenerated tissue had a slowly mature process in both groups. At 12 weeks, the regenerated tissue in the experimental group appeared much more thicker and white with higher percentages of defect filling macroscopically. In histology, the experimental group found a majority of hyaline-like regenerate tissue with intense Safranin-O and collagen type II staining, while fibrocartilage-like tissue was mostly seen in the microfracture group with poor Safranin-O and collagen type II staining. The experimental group had higher Wakitani scores and narrower acellular zones than those in the microfracture group (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). For biochemical analysis, both the GAG content and the DNA-normalized GAG content saw a time-dependent increase with a much higher value found in the experimental group at 8 and 12 weeks (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). On the contrary, the total DNA content decreased with time in both groups, and the difference between the two groups was only found at 4 and 8 weeks (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). For gene expression analysis, the experimental group had much higher expression levels than the microfracture group as for collagen type II and aggrecan, but not for collagen type I. CONCLUSION: Microfracture combined with paste implantation can result in improved quality of the reparative tissue and may have a positive effect on the integration to the surrounding cartilage in the rabbit model. The technique offers a promising treatment option for cartilage defects and improves the regeneration of articular cartilage for patients with painful chondral lesions.",1

Patients were enrolled between June 2012 and September 2016. The primary endpoint of the study was the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at 52 weeks after implantation. The IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were evaluated at the time of screening and at 4, 12, 24, 36, and 52 weeks after implantation. Improvements from the baseline scores were evaluated using the equation ""(postoperative score) - (preoperative score)."" Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 2, 12, 24, and 52 weeks after implantation, and MRI measurements were evaluated using T1 rho and T2 mapping.Nine patients were enrolled in this study and were examined for safety. Product quality did not satisfy the specification in one patient, and bacterial joint infection occurred in one patient. As a result, seven patients were included in the outcome analyses. The mean IKDC score significantly improved from 36.4 preoperatively to 74.1% at 52 weeks after implantation (p < 0.0001). The mean Lysholm and VAS scores also significantly improved from 39.6 to 57.4 to 89.6 and 22.9, respectively, after surgery. In the MRI evaluation, the T1 rho and T2 values of the implanted area were similar to those of the surrounding cartilage at 52 weeks after implantation.Third generation ACI (IK-01) can be an effective treatment option for focal cartilage defects of the knee; however, surgeons must pay careful attention to the risk of postoperative joint infection.",1

Patients were excluded if they underwent implantation of premade plugs, had an overlapping OCA configuration (""snowman"" technique), or did not undergo MRI at 6 months postoperatively. Patients were matched by lesion location, lesion size, age, and body mass index, as well as whether they underwent previous surgical procedures. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation, the independent t test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the χ2 test.A total of 58 patients (29 per group) were included in this study, with an average age of 36.4 ± 10.1 years and mean body mass index of 28.6 ± 5.1. The mean size of the analyzed OCA plugs was 3.3 ± 1 cm2. At an average imaging follow-up of 5.6 ± 1 months, 86.2% of the grafts had achieved osseous integration at the graft-host junction and 75.9% did not show any cystic changes in the subchondral bone. No difference in any OCAMRISS subscale was seen comparing OCAs with and without BMA augmentation (P > .05). Specifically, osseous integration and subchondral cyst formation were comparable between groups (P = .128 and P = .539, respectively).OCAs showed excellent osseous integration at the graft-host junction on 6-month postoperative MRI. The treatment of OCAs with autogenous BMA did not result in superior imaging outcomes when analyzed using the OCAMRISS.Level III, case-control study.",1

Because the lack of OCA bone integration can be a cause of treatment failure, methods for speeding and enhancing OCA bone integration to mitigate this potential complication are highly desirable. Purpose: To determine if autogenous bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMC) treatment of large femoral condylar OCAs would be associated with superior radiographic OCA bone integration compared with nontreated allografts during the critical first 6 months after surgery. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A review of patients enrolled in a prospective registry who were treated with transplantation of large OCAs to one or both femoral condyles at our institution from March 12, 2013 to March 14, 2016 was performed. Patients were stratified into 2 groups based on BMC treatment versus no BMC treatment; the treatment was nonrandomized and was rooted in a shift in practice and a continuing effort to optimize OCA transplantation at our institution. Patients were excluded if they did not have orthogonal view radiographs performed at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. Each condyle undergoing OCA transplantation was assessed individually by an independent musculoskeletal radiologist, who was blinded to the treatment group and time point. OCAs were assessed with respect to graft integration (0%-100%; 0 = no integration, 100 = complete integration) and degree of sclerosis (0-3; 0 = normal, 1 = mild sclerosis, 2 = moderate sclerosis, and 3 = severe sclerosis) of the graft at each time point. Results: This study identified 17 condyles in 15 patients who underwent OCA transplantation without BMC and 29 condyles in 22 patients who underwent OCA transplantation with BMC. The BMC group had significantly ( P = .033) higher graft integration scores at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery. Graft sclerosis was significantly ( P = .017) less in the BMC group at 6 weeks and 3 months, with no significant difference at 6 months after surgery. When combining the groups to examine the influence of smoking on graft integration, nonsmokers had significantly ( P = .007) higher graft integration scores at 6 months. Conclusion: Large femoral condylar OCAs treated with autogenous BMC before implantation showed superior radiographic integration to bone and less sclerosis during the initial 6-month postoperative period. BMC treatment of OCAs may mitigate the failure of OCA bone healing.",1

Since a lack of OCA bone integration can be a cause of treatment failure, methods for speeding and enhancing OCA bone integration to mitigate this potential complication are highly desirable. This study sought to determine and compare the potential of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMC) and leukoreduced platelet rich plasma (PRP) to repopulate the osseous portion of an OCA with cells and deliver osteogenic proteins. It was hypothesized that BMC would have significantly higher colony forming units (CFUs)/mL and seed the osseous portion of OCA with more cells than PRP. Finally, we hypothesized that the media of BMC and PRP treated OCAs would have significantly higher concentrations of osteogenic proteins compared with negative control OCAs. Cylindrical OCAs (n = 36) created from tissue stored for 21 days were treated with BMC (n = 12) or PRP (n = 12) obtained for 6 dogs, or left untreated as a negative control (n = 12). After treatment, OCAs were cultured for 7 or 14 days. Media were collected for analysis of osteogenic biomarker concentration. Samples of each BMC and PRP were tested for CFU concentration. On day 7 or 14, the grafts were assessed for cell surface adhesion and penetration using fluorescent microscopy. Significant differences in CFU and media biomarker concentration between the groups were determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post-hoc test with the significance set at p &lt; 0.05. Only OCAs saturated with BMC had viable cells detectable on the osseous portion of the allografts at day 7 and 14 of culture. BMC samples had a significantly higher (p = 0.029) CFU/mL compared with PRP samples. At day 3 and/or 7 of culture, the concentration of several osteogenic proteins was significantly higher in both BMC and PRP samples. Autogenous BMC can be used to deliver both a cell population and osteogenic proteins that may improve healing of the osseous portion of the OCA clinically.",1

Methods Two groups of 20 patients were arthroscopically treated with microfractures for a symptomatic focal chondral defect of the knee. At the end of surgery, in the experimental group, micro-fragmented stromal-vascular fraction was injected into the joint. Primary end point was WOMAC score at 12 months. Secondary end points were any adverse events, Oxford Knee Score, EQ-5D score, VAS for pain, analgesic and anti-inflammatory consumption. Results All the patients were evaluated at 12-month follow-up. No adverse reactions were noted. Analgesic and anti-inflammatory consumption was similar in both groups. At 1-month follow-up, no differences were noted between groups when compared to pre-operative scores. At 3-month follow-up, patients in both groups improved from the baseline in all variables. Significantly lower VAS scores were found in the experimental group (4.2 +/- 3.2 vs. 5.9 +/- 1.7, p = 0.04). At 6- and 12-month follow-ups, patients in the experimental group scored better in all outcomes with a moderate effect size; in particular, better WOMAC scores were obtained at 12 months, achieving the primary end-point of the study (17.7 +/- 11.1 vs. 25.5 +/- 12.7; p = 0.03). Conclusions Injection of micro-fragmented stromal-vascular fraction is safe and, when associated with microfractures, is more effective in clinical terms than microfractures alone in patients affected by symptomatic focal chondral lesions of the knee. Results of the current study provide information that could help physicians to improve their counseling for patients concerning ADMSCs.",1

Although this approach is reasonable, continuing advances in the field of cartilage repair will further expand the options available to improve outcomes. In the present clinical study, we compared the outcomes of matrix-induced autologous mesenchymal stem cell implantation (m-AMI) with matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (m-ACI) for the treatment of isolated chondral defects of the knee. Prospective, single-site, randomized, single-blind pilot study. Fourteen patients with isolated full-thickness chondral lesions of the knee \textbackslashtextgreater 2 cm(2) were randomized into two treatment groups: m-AMI and m-ACI. Outcomes were assessed pre-operatively and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-operatively. Clinical evaluations revealed that improvement from pre-operation to 24 months post-operation occurred in both groups (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). At all follow-up intervals, m-AMI demonstrated significantly better functional outcomes (motion deficit and straight leg raise strength) than did m-ACI (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). At all follow-up intervals, m-AMI demonstrated significantly better subjective sub-scale scores for pain, symptoms, activities of daily living and sport and recreation of the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) than did m-ACI (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). Additionally, m-AMI demonstrated significantly better (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05) scores than m-ACI for the quality of life sub-scale of the KOOS and visual analog scale (VAS) severity at the 6-month follow-up. The Tegner activity score and VAS frequency were not significantly different between the two groups. Graft failure was not observed on magnetic resonance imaging at the 24-month follow-up. m-AMI and m-ACI demonstrated very good-to-excellent and good-to-very good infill, respectively, with no adverse effects from the implant, regardless of the treatment. For the treatment of isolated full-thickness chondral lesion of the knee, m-AMI can be used effectively and may potentially accelerate recovery. A larger patient cohort and follow-up supported by histological analyses are necessary to determine long-term outcomes.",1

Consequently, many studies have been performed to identify suitable prevention and treatment interventions. In recent years, both arthroscopic microfracture (AM) and stem cell therapy have been used clinically to treat OA. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of AM in the presence and absence of a stromal vascular fraction (SVF) injection in the management of patients with OA. Thirty patients with grade 2 or 3 (Lawrence scale) OA of the knee participated in this study. Placebo group patients (n = 15) received AM alone; treatment group patients (n = 15) received AM and an adipose tissue-derived SVF injection. The SVF was suspended in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) before injection into the joint. Patient groups were monitored and scored with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), Lysholm, Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS), and modified Outerbridge classifications before treatment and at 6, 12, and 18 months post-treatment. Bone marrow edema was also assessed at these time points. Patients were evaluated for knee activity (joint motion amplitude) and adverse effects relating to surgery and stem cell injection. Treatment efficacy was significantly different between placebo and treatment groups. All treatment group patients had significantly reduced pain and WOMAC scores, and increased Lysholm and VAS scores compared with the placebo group. These findings suggest that the SVF/PRP injection efficiently improved OA for 18 months after treatment. This study will be continuously monitored for additional 24 months.",1

Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to compare the early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance, including quantitative T2 values, between cartilage defects treated with a scaffold versus a scaffold with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC). The hypothesis was that the addition of PRP or BMAC would result in an improved cartilage appearance. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Forty-six patients with full-thickness cartilage defects of the femur were surgically treated with a control scaffold (n = 11), scaffold with PRP (n = 23), or scaffold with BMAC (n = 12) and were followed prospectively. Patients underwent MRI with a qualitative assessment and quantitative T2 mapping at 12 months after surgery. An image assessment was performed retrospectively by a blinded musculoskeletal radiologist. The cartilage phase was measured by cartilage fill and quantitative T2 values on MRI. A comparison between groups after cartilage repair was performed. Results: The control scaffold group consisted of 8 male and 3 female patients (mean age, 38 years; mean body mass index [BMI], 25 kg/m 2 ), the PRP group had 15 male and 8 female patients (mean age, 39 years; mean BMI, 26 kg/m 2 ), and the BMAC group consisted of 8 male and 4 female patients (mean age, 36 years; mean BMI, 26 kg/m 2 ). The PRP-treated ( P = .002) and BMAC-treated ( P = .03) scaffolds had superior cartilage fill compared with the control group. With quantitative methods, the PRP group demonstrated a mean T2 value (49.1 ms) that was similar to that of the control scaffold group (42.7 ms; P = .07), but the BMAC group demonstrated a mean T2 value (60.5 ms) closer to that of superficial hyaline cartilage ( P = .01). The stratification of T2 values between the deep and superficial zones was not observed in any of the groups. Conclusion: In this comparative study, patients treated with scaffold implantation augmented with BMAC had improved cartilage maturation with greater fill and mean T2 values closer to that of superficial native hyaline cartilage at 12 months. Further work will determine if this translates into improved clinical outcomes.",1

Patients were prospectively evaluated for 4 years. All patients were evaluated with MRI, KOOS, IKDC, VAS and Tegner scores preoperatively and at two-year and final follow-up.At final follow-up, all scores significantly improved (P < 0.001) as follows: all KOOS score categories; Tegner 2 (range 0-4) to 6 (range 4-8) and 3 (range 0-6) to 6 (range 3-10); IKDC subjective (39.2 ± 16.5 to 82.2 ± 8.9) and (40.8 ± 13.9 to 79.4 ± 14.6), in the study and control group respectively. In addition, we show that results are affected by lesion size and number but not from concomitant surgical procedures. MRI showed complete filling in 80 % of patients in the study group and 71 % of patients in the control group. Histological analysis conducted in three patients from the study and two patients from the control group revealed good tissue repair with a variable amount of hyaline-like tissue.Treatment of cartilage lesions with BMAC and Hyalofast is a viable and effective option that is mainly affected by lesion size and number and not by age. In particular, it allows to address the >45 years population with functional outcomes that are comparable to younger patients at final follow-up.Prospective cohort study, Level II.",1

Our primary focus is on the effects of this procedure on children and adolescent patients as there is a lack of knowledge regarding the clinical outcomes in children/adolescents in particular when compared with adults. METHODS: A total of 40 patients (43 defects) \textbackslashtextless20 years with cartilage defects of the knee were treated with third generation ACI (Novocart® 3D). These defects were caused by osteochondritis dissecans (n = 13), acute trauma (\textbackslashtextless12 months) (n = 9), old trauma (\textbackslashtextgreater12 months) (n = 5) or unknown pathology (n = 13). The mean defect size was 5.2 cm(2). IKDC subjective score and VAS (at rest and during activity) were used for clinical evaluation after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months post-operatively. The results of these patients were compared with 40 matched adult patients. Match paired analysis was performed by numbers of treated defects, defect location and defect size. All cartilage defects were arthroscopically classified with IKDC grade III-IV. All adult patients in the control group were treated with matrix based autologous chondrocyte implantation. RESULTS: All patients showed significantly better clinical results compared with the pre-operative findings in the follow-up over three years. We observed significantly better results in the IKDC score and VAS during the whole postoperative follow-up in children and adolescents after six, 12, 24 and 36 months compared with the adult control group. The IKDC score improved from 46.5 preoperative to 77.5 (+31) after three years in children and adolescents. Similarly, significantly lower stress pain after six months and one, two and three years was found in this group. CONCLUSION: This study showed that third generation autologous chondrocyte implantation is a suitable method for the treatment of full cartilage defects in children and adolescents.",1

Magnetic resonance imaging also assessed the interface between the repaired and native cartilage, changes in the subchondral bone, and the appearance of cartilage over the opposite and adjacent (native) surfaces. One hundred eighty magnetic resonance imaging examinations were obtained in 112 patients who had cartilage-resurfacing procedures, including 86 microfractures and 35 autologous chondrocyte implantations, at a mean of 15 and 13 months after surgery, respectively. Autologous chondrocyte implantations showed consistently better fill of the defects at all times compared with microfracture. The graft hypertrophied in 63% of surgeries.

In the drilling group patients, lesions were penetrated with multiple 1.2-mm Kirschner wires, and in the AOG group patients, grafts were made to cartilage defects from one to three osteochondral pegs harvested from the less-weight-bearing periphery of the articular surface of the femoral condyle. The patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee examination score. Second-look arthroscopy was performed to evaluate the repaired cartilage macroscopically. <h3>Results</h3> The median follow-up duration was 25 (range, 12–42) months. The IKDC scores were significantly improved from 64.4 to 95.4 points in the drilling group and from 52.3 to 94.3 points in the AOG group, with no difference between the two groups, although there was a difference in the repaired cartilage findings of arthroscopy. <h3>Conclusion</h3> In this study, no differences in IKDC scores were found in patients with a concomitant ACL rupture and an osteochondral lesion treated by drilling or AOG at a minimum follow-up of 1year, regardless of the differences at arthroscopic grading of the ICRS classification. <h3>Level of evidence</h3> Case–control study (LEVEL III).",1

MR examination was made before surgery and 6, 12, and 18 months thereafter. Qualitative changes in cartilage were observed by means of delayed gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage sequence using Gd-DTPA2− and Gd-DOTA. In each examination, GAGs content was determined at three locations: the defect, its surroundings, and a non-load-bearing reference area. <h3>Results</h3> Measured indices showed no statistically significant differences in changes within the defect area when comparing the two treatment types at individual time points of 6, 12, and 18 months. In the case of microfracture treatment, more substantial decrease in GAGs concentration occurred at month 6, whereas the greatest decline occurred at month 12 when using an implant. Change in GAGs content and decline in cartilage quality were substantial also in the reference area and close surroundings. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Hyaline cartilage behaves as a unified whole, and change in GAGs content was marked also in locations with no morphological damage. Over the monitored period, no statistically significant difference between treatment types was noted as measured by GAGs content in the defect or its close surroundings. dGEMRIC is suitable for monitoring cartilage quality even if use of Gd-DTPA2− is not possible, because comparable results were achieved using Gd-DOTA.",1

At present two techniques have been described to retain the chondrocyte suspension within the defect. The first involves using a periosteal cover (ACI-P) and the second involves using a type I/III collagen membrane (ACI-C). To the authors knowledge there are no comparative studies of these two techniques in the current literature. We have therefore undertaken such a study to establish if there is a difference between the 2 techniques based on a clinical and arthroscopic assessment. <h3>Methods</h3> A total of 68 patients with a mean age of 30.52years with symptomatic articular cartilage defects were randomised to have either ACI-P (33 patients) or ACI-C (35 patients). The mean defect size was 4.54cm<sup>2</sup>. All patients were followed up at 24months. <h3>Results</h3> A clinical and functional assessment showed that 74% of patients had a good or excellent result following the ACI-C compared with 67% after the ACI-P at 2years. Arthroscopy at 1year also demonstrated similar results for both techniques. However, 36.4% of the ACI-P grafts required shaving for hypertrophy compared with none for the ACI-C grafts at 1year. <h3>Discussion</h3> This study has shown no statistical difference between the clinical outcome of ACI-C versus ACI-P at 2years. A significant number of patients who had the ACI-P required shaving of a hypertrophied graft. We conclude that there is no advantage in using periosteum as a cover for retaining chondrocytes within an osteochondral defect; as a result we advocate the use of an alternative cover such as a manufactured type I/III collagen membrane.",1

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose dependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without significant dose dependence. The mean MOCART scores after 3 months (0 = worst, 100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients; at 12 months, these were 74.1, 74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients. Several MOCART items (surface of repair tissue, structure of repair tissue, signal intensity of repair tissue, subchondral bone, and synovitis) showed a more rapid response with the medium and high doses than with the low dose, suggesting a potential dose relationship. No significant correlation between the MOCART (overall and subscores) with clinical outcomes as assessed by the overall KOOS was detected at 3- and 12-month assessments.This study reveals a trend toward earlier recovery after treatment with higher spheroid doses in terms of better defect filling for full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee, while outcomes after 12 months were similar in all dose groups. However, a correlation with clinical outcomes or the failure rate at 1 year after ACI was not found. A longer follow-up will be required for more definite conclusions on the clinical relevance of ACI cell density to be drawn.NCT01225575 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier); 2009-016816-20 (EudraCT number).",1

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and histological outcomes of these two techniques.We performed a prospective clinical study to investigate the two-year outcomes in forty patients with an articular cartilage lesion of the femoral condyle who had been randomly treated with either transplantation of an autologous osteochondral cylinder or implantation of autologous chondrocytes. Biopsy specimens from representative patients of both groups were evaluated with histological staining, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy.According to the postoperative Lysholm score, the recovery after autologous chondrocyte implantation was slower than that after osteochondral transplantation at six months (p < or = 0.015), twelve months (p < or = 0.001), and twenty-four months (p < or = 0.012). On the basis of the Meyers score and the Tegner activity score, the results were equally good with the two methods two years after treatment. Histomorphological evaluation of biopsy specimens within two years after autologous chondrocyte implantation demonstrated a complete, mechanically stable resurfacing of the defect in all patients. The tissue consisted mainly of fibrocartilage, while localized areas of hyaline-like regenerative cartilage could be detected close to the subchondral bone. Although a gap remained at the site of the transplantation in all five biopsy specimens examined as long as two years after osteochondral cylinder transplantation, histomorphological analysis and scanning electron microscopy revealed no differences between the osteochondral transplants and the surrounding original cartilage.Both treatments resulted in a decrease in symptoms. However, the improvement provided by the autologous chondrocyte implantation lagged behind that provided by the osteochondral cylinder transplantation. Histologically, the defects treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation were primarily filled with fibrocartilage, whereas the osteochondral cylinder transplants retained their hyaline character, although there was a persistent interface between the transplant and the surrounding original cartilage. Limitations of our study included the small number of patients, the relatively short (two-year) follow-up, and the absence of a control group.",1

Design Seven PT patients and 5 ACT patients who underwent surgery on the femoral condyle between 1986 and 1996 were included. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were assessed by the clinical questionnaires: Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for knee pain. The morphological (MOCART score) and biochemical quality (glycosaminoglycans [GAGs] content and collagen integrity) of cartilage transplants and surrounding articular cartilage were analyzed by 7T MRI. The results of the PT and ACT patients were compared. Finally, a detailed morphological analysis of the grafts alone was performed. Results No statistically significant difference was found for the PROMs and MOCART scores of PT and ACT patients. Evaluation of the graft alone showed poor repair tissue quality and high prevalence of intralesional osteophyte formation in both the PT and ACT patients. Penetration of the graft surface by the intralesional osteophyte was related to biochemically damaged opposing tibial cartilage; GAG content was significantly lower in patients with an osteophyte penetrating the graft surface. Conclusions Both PT and ACT patients have a high incidence of intralesional osteophyte formation 25 years after surgery. The resulting biochemical damage to the opposing tibial cartilage might be dependent on osteophyte morphology.",1

Matrix-guided autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI(R)) was compared with microfracture (MFX) to demonstrate the reconstitution of cartilage over a two-year period using the morphological capabilities of MRI. Patients and methods. 27 patients (9 females and 18 males, mean age 33 years) underwent MACI on the knee joint. The defects originated from trauma (15 cases), osteochondritis dissecans (8 cases) and chronic repetitive trauma (4 cases) and were localized at the condyles (24 cases) or patella (3 cases). All patients were examined postoperatively after 1, 3,6,12 and 24 months with a 1,5 T unit (Gyroscan, Philips) using proton- and T2w spinecho and T1w fatsuppressed 3D gradientecho sequences. We measured the signal intensities of the implant and neighbouring cartilage to calculate the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and the thickness of cartilage and implant layers to define the defect filling rate. Finally, partial and complete remission was defined on MRI and compared with clinical data and morphology on MRI. Additionally, 7 patients were treated with MFX and, subsequently examined on MRI with the same protocol. Results. After MACI, MRI showed a partial but no complete equilibration of signal intensities of implant and adjacent cartilage over the 1 and 2 year follow-up periods which was shown by reduction of CNR from 21 to 10 on 3D-GE and from 26 to 9 on T2w SE sequences. Continuous growth of the implants resulted in an increased filling of the defects starting at 40% after 0.5 year to 85% after 1 or 2 years. Complete remission was found on MRI in 17/27 cases, and remission rate was influenced by etiology of cartilage defect but not by age and gender of patients or size and location of defects. The Lysholm-Gillquist score improved from 49.7 to 97.3. After MFX equilibration of signal intensities and growth of the regenerating fibrous cartilage was less pronounced and complete remission was found in only 2/7 cases. In addition, the clinical score improved from 45.5 to 74.2. Conclusion. Direct imaging of cartilage with MRI and assessment of clinical scores allowed improved documentation of the outcome after MACI and MFX. MRI showed that MACI is superior to MFX concerning rate of complete remissions and filling of the defect with regenerating tissue. Clinical examinations showed better scores for MACI than for MFX.",1

The purposes of the current study were to investigate the feasibility of the application of defect-sized femoral implants for the treatment of localized cartilage defects and to compare this treatment, in terms of joint degeneration, with the use of microfracture in a goat model of established cartilage defects.In nine Dutch milk goats, a defect in the medial femoral condyle was created in both knees. After ten weeks, the knees were randomly treated by microfracture or by placement of an oxidized zirconium implant. At twenty-six weeks after surgery, the animals were killed. The joints were evaluated macroscopically. Implant osseointegration was measured by automated histomorphometry, and cartilage repair (after microfracture) was scored histologically. Cartilage quality was analyzed macroscopically and histologically. Glycosaminoglycan content and release were measured by alcian blue assay, and the synthesis and release of newly formed glycosaminoglycans were measured by liquid scintillation analysis of the incorporation of 35SO4(2-) in tissue and medium.The mean bone-implant contact (and standard error) was appropriate (14.6%+/-5.4%), and the amount of bone surrounding the implant was extensive (mean, 40.3%+/-4.0%). The healing of the microfracture-treated defects was extensive, although not complete (mean, 18.38+/-0.43 points of a maximum possible score of 24 points). The macroscopic cartilage evaluation did not show any significant differences between the treatments. On histologic evaluation, the cartilage of the medial tibial plateau articulating directly against the treated defects demonstrated significantly more degeneration in the microfracture-treated knees than in the implant-treated knees (p<0.05). This was in accordance with a significantly higher glycosaminoglycan content, higher synthetic activity, and decreased glycosaminoglycan release of the medial tibial plateau cartilage of the implant-treated knees (p<0.05 for all). On histological analysis, degeneration was also found in the cartilage of the lateral tibial plateau and condyle, but no significant difference was found between the treatments.Both microfracture and the use of implants as a treatment for established localized cartilage defects in the medial femoral condyle caused considerable (p < 0.05) degeneration of the directly articulating cartilage as well as in more remote sites in the knee. However, in the medial tibial plateau, the metal implants caused less damage than the microfracture technique.",1

Autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) is one of the few reliable treatment options of cartilage defects with good long-term outcomes. The improvement of ACT led to the matrix-based ACT (MACT). The purpose of the study was to compare two different commercially available MACT systems. Methods Eleven patients with a cartilage defect of the knee were treated with the MACI(A (R)) system and another nine patients with the CaRes(A (R)) implant. The patients were prospectively followed and re-examined after one year. Results One year after surgery all but one patient have significantly improved in their clinical outcome. Both types of MACT revealed similar results in terms of increase in level of activity, pain relief and knee function. Conclusion The study showed that MACT is a good therapeutic option for full-size defects of the femoral condyle. The MACI(A (R)) implant seems to be easier to handle which is reflected by smaller incisions and a shorter operation time.",1

A randomized study,"Purpose There is an increasing number of reports on the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA) using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, it is not known what would better drive osteoarthritis stabilization to postpone total knee arthroplasty (TKA): targeting the synovial fluid by injection or targeting on the subchondral bone with MSCs implantation. Methods A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was carried out between 2000 and 2005 in 120 knees of 60 patients with painful bilateral knee osteoarthritis with a similar osteoarthritis grade. During the same anaesthesia, a bone marrow concentrate of 40 mL containing an average 5727 MSCs/mL (range 2740 to 7540) was divided in two equal parts: after randomization, one part (20 mL) was delivered to the subchondral bone of femur and tibia of one knee (subchondral group) and the other part was injected in the joint for the contralateral knee (intra-articular group). MSCs were counted as CFU-F (colony fibroblastic unit forming). Clinical outcomes of the patient (Knee Society score) were obtained along with radiological imaging outcomes (including MRIs) at two year follow-up. Subsequent revision surgeries were identified until the most recent follow-up (average of 15 years, range 13 to 18 years). Results At two year follow-up, clinical and imaging (MRI) improvement was higher on the side that received cells in the subchondral bone. At the most recent follow-up (15 years), among the 60 knees treated with subchondral cell therapy, the yearly arthroplasty incidence was 1.3% per knee-year; for the 60 knees with intra-articular cell therapy, the yearly arthroplasty incidence was higher (p = 0.01) with an incidence of 4.6% per knee-year. For the side with subchondral cell therapy, 12 (20%) of 60 knees underwent TKA, while 42 (70%) of 60 knees underwent TKA on the side with intra-articular cell therapy. Among the 18 patients who had no subsequent surgery on both sides, all preferred the knee with subchondral cell therapy. Conclusions Implantation of MSCs in the subchondral bone of an osteoarthritic knee is more effective to postpone TKA than injection of the same intra-articular dose in the contralateral knee with the same grade of osteoarthritis.",1

Hypothesis: A novel graft preservation method combined with surgical technique and patient management improvements would lead to consistently successful outcomes after osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: With institutional review board approval and informed consent, patients were prospectively enrolled into a registry to follow outcomes after OCA transplantation. Patients were included when ≥1-year follow-up data were available, including complications and reoperations, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), compliance with rehabilitation, revisions, and failures. Results: For patients meeting inclusion criteria (N = 194), mean ± SD age was 37.9 ± 12.2 years and mean BMI was 28.9 ± 5; 38% received unipolar transplants (44% multisurface) and 62% received bipolar transplants. OCAs were preserved by standard tissue bank methods (standard preservation [SP]; 29%) or the novel method (Missouri Osteochondral Preservation System [MOPS]; 71%). Initial success rates were 79% for all cases combined, 60% for SP, and 84% for MOPS. MOPS cases were significantly ( P = .028) more likely to be associated with successful outcomes when compared with SP cases. PROMs improved significantly ( P &lt; .05) for all cohorts through 3 to 4 years of follow-up. Revisions were performed in 19 cases (10%). MOPS grafts were associated with a significantly ( P = .0014) lower revision rate (5%) than SP grafts (21%). Failures occurred in 26 patients (13%), with all undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Bipolar cases were significantly ( P = .008) more likely to be associated with failure. MOPS grafts were associated with a significantly ( P = .048) lower failure rate (11%) than were SP grafts (19%). Noncompliance with the prescribed rehabilitation protocol was significantly ( P = .00008) more likely to be associated with failure. Conclusion: Prospective data for 194 cases revealed that OCA transplantation for unipolar, multisurface, and bipolar cartilage restoration can be associated with consistently successful outcomes. The 5% revision rate, 11% failure rate, 82%-94% survival probability estimates, and continually improving PROMs through postoperative 3 to 4 years underscore major advances in outcomes as compared with previous reports. These encouraging results were realized with the use of a novel graft preservation method; autogenous bone marrow concentrate pretreatment of donor bone; advancements in graft cutting, implantation, and stabilization techniques; and procedure-specific rehabilitation protocols.",1

Purpose: To identify which factors may predict decreased graft survival after ACI among patients who underwent a prior MST. A secondary aim was to investigate the specificity of these predictors. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: In this review of prospectively collected data, the authors analyzed 38 patients who had failed prior MST surgery and subsequently underwent collagen-covered ACI (case group). The case group was divided into graft failure ACI (n = 8, 21%) and successful ACI (n = 30, 79%). Fourteen clinical variables were categorized and analyzed to determine predictors for failure of the ACI graft: age, body mass index, sex, defect characteristics (number, size, location, etiology, type), presence of kissing lesion, intraoperative presence of intralesional osteophyte, time between an MST and ACI, previous surgery, duration of the symptoms, and concomitant surgical procedure. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate the severity of subchondral bone marrow edema (BME), graded I (absent) to IV (severe), and the presence of subchondral cyst, hypertrophic sclerosis, and intralesional osteophyte. The effects of these MRI findings on the graft survivor were also investigated. Concurrently, a control group without a prior MST was matched to investigate the specificity of the previously determined predictors. These patients were matched individually according to age, sex, body mass index, and outcome of the procedure (failure [n = 8] or successful [n = 30] per the case group). Results: In the case group, the presence of preoperative severe BME was significantly higher among patients with failed ACI as compared with patients with successful ACI ( P &lt; .001). In the control group, the presence of severe BME was not significantly different between the failure and successful groups ( P = .747). The ACI graft failure rate among patients with a prior MST and preoperative grade IV BME was 83.7% at 5 years postoperatively, resulting in a significantly lower survival rate as compared with patients with a prior MST and without severe BME (5-year graft failure rate, 6.5%; P &lt; .001). All the other parameters did not differ significantly. Conclusion: After a prior MST, the presence of grade IV BME by MRI was a predictive factor for graft failure among patients who then underwent second-generation ACI.",1

However, it is not clear whether graft hypertrophy is a complication or an adjustment reaction in the cartilage regeneration after ACI. Purpose: To analyze the cartilage quality of the ACI regeneration with graft hypertrophy using T2-weighted mapping. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 91 patients with isolated cartilage defects (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade III-IV) of the knee were treated with Novocart 3D, a third-generation, matrix-based, ACI procedure in the knee joint. All patients were evaluated with a standardized magnetic resonance imaging protocol after 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months postoperatively. For morphological and biochemical assessment, the T2-weighted relaxation times of the ACI grafts as well as the healthy surrounding cartilage were determined. The results of the 20 patients with graft hypertrophy (hypertrophic group) were compared with the results of 21 matched patients without graft hypertrophy (nonhypertrophic group) after ACI. Match-paired analysis was performed by comparison of age, defect size, and body mass index. Results: The T2-weighted relaxation times of the ACI graft showed significant improvement, with values decreasing from 52.1 milliseconds to 33.3 milliseconds after 48 months. After 12 months, the T2-weighted relaxation times were constant and comparable with the healthy surrounding cartilage. Graft hypertrophy was seen in 22% (n = 20) of the patients who underwent ACI. A significant difference in T2-weighted relaxation times between the hypertrophic and nonhypertrophic ACI grafts could not be found except after 36 months (hypertrophic T2-weighted relaxation time/nonhypertrophic T2-weighted relaxation time: 3 months, 48.0/56.4 ms, P = .666; 6 months, 45.6/42.5 ms, P = .280; 12 months, 39.3/34.7 ms, P = .850; 24 months, 34.8/32.2 ms, P = .742; 36 months, 34.6/38.2 ms, P = .030; 48 months, 34.2/32.3 ms, P = .693). Conclusion: The T2-weighted relaxation time of the ACI graft cartilage showed significant improvements over the observation period of 4 years postoperatively. After 2 years, graft maturation was completed. Graft hypertrophy after ACI was seen in 22% of the patients.

Methods Thirty-six consecutive patients (15 to 59 years) with chronic osteochondral lesions (1.8-10 cm(2)) in the condylar or patellofemoral knee surfaces were enrolled. Lesions were covered with CHAS fixed with a fibrin glue. The superficial layer of CHAS was intra-operatively injected with active cells: in initial five patients, ACs were put directly onto dry CHAS (dry-AC); next, eight AC patients had CHAS moistened with cell culture media (media-AC), while the tourniquet was released allowing blood soaking of CHAS in the rest (14 blood-AC, 9 blood-fBMSC). Seventeen (50%) patients required different concomitant procedures. All patients were followed for serious adverse events (SAE) or graft failures; clinical, radiographic, and MRI evaluation was conducted. Cellular data on the injected cells were assessed. Results At a follow-up of 39 months (16-81), 17 patients required an additional surgical intervention: seven graft-related SAE (early post-operative synovitis and/or arthrofibrosis) were registered (3 dry-AC, 3 media-AC, 1 blood-fBMSC). There were two graft failures (1 dry-AC, 1 blood-fBMSC) for secondary reasons.

There was evidence of radiographic osteoarthritis progression-Kellgren-Lawrence 1.0 to 1.5. MOCART scores at the final follow-up averaged 71 (10 to 95). Graft-type analysis demonstrated an increased rate of graft-related SAE in dry-AC and media-AC, but their final outcomes were equivalent. Cellular data of AC at the implantation were as follows: cells in suspension 9.2 x 10(6), viability 95%. In blood-fBMSC group, a cell suspension with 87% viability was injected, which contained 1156 CFU-Fs. Conclusion CHAS with intra-operative seeding of active cells, either AC or fBMSC, led to an overall successful outcome for the treatment of chronic osteochondral lesions in the knee. Blood soaking of CHAS in situ before cell seeding significantly decreased early post-operative adverse events, such as synovitis and arthrofibrosis.",1

Meniscus injury or meniscectomy results in decreased function of the meniscus and increased risk of knee osteoarthritis. To preserve the meniscal functions, meniscal repair should be considered as the first option for meniscus injury. Although reoperation rates are higher after meniscal repair compared with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, long-term follow-up of meniscal repair demonstrated better clinical outcomes and less severe degenerative changes of osteoarthritis compared with partial meniscectomy. In the past, the indication of a meniscal repair was limited both because of technical reasons and due to the localised vascularity of the meniscus. Meanwhile, it spreads today as the development of the concept to preserve the meniscus and the improvement of meniscal repair techniques. Longitudinal vertical tears in the peripheral third are considered the ‘gold standard' indication in terms of meniscus healing. Techniques for meniscal repair include ‘inside-out', ‘outside-in' and ‘all-inside' strategies. Surgical decision-making depends on the type, size and location of the meniscus injury. Meniscal root tears substantially affect meniscal hoop function and accelerate cartilage degeneration; therefore, meniscus root repair is necessary to prevent the progression of osteoarthritis change. For symptomatic meniscus defects after meniscectomy, transplantation of allograft or collagen meniscus implant may be indicated, and acceptable clinical results have been obtained. Recently, meniscus extrusion has attracted attention due to increased interest in early osteoarthritis. The centralisation techniques have been proposed to reduce the meniscus extrusion by suturing the meniscus-capsule complex to the edge of the tibial plateau. Long-term clinical outcomes of this procedure may change the strategy of treating meniscus extrusion. When malalignment of the lower leg is accompanied with meniscus pathologies, knee osteotomies are a reasonable option to protect the repaired meniscus by unloading the pathological compartment. Advancements in biological augmentation such as bone marrow stimulation, fibrin clot, platelet-rich plasma, stem cell therapy and scaffolds have also expanded the indications for meniscus surgery. In summary, improved repair techniques and biological augmentation have made meniscus repair more appealing to treat that had previously been considered irreparable. However, further research would be necessary to validate the efficacy of these specialised technique.",0

For this purpose suitable biocompatible scaffolds are needed to provide cell retention, chondrogenesis and initial mechanical stability. The present study should indicate whether a recently developed highly porous alginate (Alg) foam scaffold supplemented with chondroitin sulfate (CS) allows the attachment, survival and chondrogenesis of BM-MSCs and articular chondrocytes. The foams were prepared using a freeze-drying method; some of them were supplemented with CS and subsequently characterized for porosity, biodegradation and mechanical profile. BM-MSCs were cultured for 1-2 weeks on the scaffold either under chondrogenic or maintenance conditions. Cell vitality assays, histology, glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) assay, and type II and I collagen immunolabelings were performed to monitor cell growth and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in the scaffolds. Scaffolds had a high porosity ~93-95% with a mean pore sizes of 237±48 μm (Alg) and 197±61 μm (Alg/CS). Incorporation of CS increased mechanical strength of the foams providing gradually CS release over 7 days. Most of the cells survived in the scaffolds. BM-MSCs and articular chondrocytes formed rounded clusters within the scaffold pores. The BM-MSCs, irrespective of whether cultured under non/chondrogenic conditions and chondrocytes produced an ECM containing sGAGs, and types II and I collagen. Total collagen and sGAG contents were higher in differentiated BM-MSC cultures supplemented with CS than in CS-free foams after 14 days. The cell cluster formation induced by the scaffolds might stimulate chondrogenesis via initial intense cell-cell contacts.",0

Their fate and distribution were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and macroscopic and histologic postmortem examination. Osteoarthritis was induced in 12 sheep by bilateral meniscectomy. After 6 weeks, one knee joint received 10 × 10 6 SPIO-labeled MSCs (Molday Ion Rhodamine B). Contralateral knees received a control injection of a) PBS, b) SPIO in PBS, c) 10 × 10 6 nonvital SPIO-labeled MSCs in PBS, or d) no injection. MR images were acquired immediately after injection and 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks thereafter using a 0.5-T unit and a T2* sequence. Signal intensity of synovial fluid and synovial lining was assessed semiquantitatively using a scoring system. Viable SPIO-labeled MSCs produced a strong hypointense signal in the synovial fluid immediately after injection, but normal signal intensity of the synovial fluid was observed 1 week later. Synovial lining maintained its hypointensity throughout the study period. Nonvital SPIO-labeled MSCs induced hypointense signals of the synovial fluid; synovial lining appeared weak and inconsistently hypointense in the following weeks. Pure SPIO produced a strong hyperintense signal in the synovial fluid at the time of injection only. Histologically, in all knee joints receiving viable SPIO-labeled MSCs, SPIO particles were detected (Prussian blue) within the synovial lining, dorsal fat pad, and neomeniscus tissue, but not in osteochondral samples. Few SPIO particles were detected in joints injected with nonvital SPIO-labeled MSCs. Immunohistologically, no increased cell death (TUNEL) was observed in the area of detected SPIO particles, but we did observe potential chondrogenic cell differentiation (Safranin O or S100β). We conclude that viable SPIO-labeled MSCs remain detectable within the joint for 12 weeks and attach themselves to some but not all diseased joint structures.",0

Case Report: A study patient's mesenchymal stem cells were obtained from her iliac crest bone marrow, isolated and expanded in culture. They were then injected into her knee along with autologous platelet lysate to enhance growth, and nanogram doses of dexamethasone to promote differentiation to chondrocytes. Pre and post treatment MRI imaging, physical therapy and pain score data were then analyzed. Conclusions: This patient's MRI data showed a significant decrease in cartilage defect size. Along with this, her measured physical therapy outcomes and subjective pain and functional status all improved.

In this study, commercially available reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) foams were tested in vitro and in vivo for compatibility with primary cell adhesion and tissue repair. Pores sizes were determined as 279 ± 98 μm. No hydroxyapatite deposition was detected after immersion of the foams in simulated body fluid. Nonetheless, RVC provided an excellent support for adhesion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as well as primary chondrocytes without any surface pre-treatment. Live cell quantification revealed neutral behaviour of the material with plastic adhered chondrocytes but moderate cytotoxicity with MSCs. Yet, rabbit implanted foams exhibited good integration in subcutaneous pockets and most importantly, total defect repair in bone. Probably due to the stiffness of the material, incompatibility with cartilage regeneration was found. Interestingly and in contrast to several other carbon materials, we observed a total lack of foreign body reactions. Our results and its outstanding porous interconnectivity and availability within a wide range of pore sizes convert RVC into an attractive candidate for tissue engineering applications in a variety of bone models and for ex vivo cell expansion for regenerative medical applications.",0

Engineered osteochondral implants can facilitate the fixation and integration with host tissue, and therefore promote the regeneration of osteochondral defects. A biphasic scaffold with a stratified two-layer structure for osteochondral tissue engineering was developed from biodegradable synthetic and naturally derived polymers. The upper layer of the scaffold for cartilage engineering was collagen sponge; the lower layer for bone engineering was a composite sponge of poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and naturally derived collagen. The PLGA–collagen composite sponge layer had a composite structure with collagen microsponge formed in the pores of a skeleton PLGA sponge. The collagen sponge in the two respective layers was connected. Observation of the collagen/PLGA–collagen biphasic scaffold by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated the connected stratified structure. The biphasic scaffold was used for culture of canine bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The cell/scaffold construct was implanted in an osteochondral defect in the knee of a one-year old beagle. Osteochondral tissue was regenerated four months after implantation. Cartilage- and bone-like tissues were formed in the respective layers. The collagen/PLGA–collagen biphasic scaffold will be useful for osteochondral tissue engineering.",0

21,https://openalex.org/W68021579,,"Microfracture: indications, technique, and results.","The so-called ""marrow stimulating"" technique of microfracture uses an awl to penetrate the subchondral bone in cartilage defects. Disruption of the subchondral bone induces fibrin clot formation in the area of the chondral defect. This clot contains pluripotent, marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, which are able to differentiate into fibrochondrocytes, resulting in a fibrocartilage repair with varying amounts of type I, II, and III collagen content. Microfracture is a single-stage procedure that is ideally suited for small, well-contained, Outerbridge grade 3 to 4 cartilage lesions. Most clinical studies of the outcomes after microfracture in the knee show improvement in knee function in 70% to 90% of patients. The long-term results vary. Almost all studies report significant improvement in the first year after surgery; some report a decline in activity levels after 1 year, especially in elite athletes. Other studies have shown a continuation of good results for up to 7 years. Recent studies have shown that a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m(2) and incomplete fibrocartilage fill of a lesion as observed on MRI correlate with a poor outcome. The technical simplicity of the procedure, cost-effectiveness, and relatively low patient morbidity make microfracture an invaluable tool for the treatment of small full-thickness cartilage lesions. Microfracture is a good first-line procedure because it does not prevent the application of other cartilage repair procedures that may be needed in the future.",0

For symptomatic lesions, several surgical options exist. Determining the best surgical option for a patient can be challenging for the treating surgeon. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is an articular cartilage–restoring procedure that is commonly used to treat medium-to-large full-thickness cartilage lesions of the knee. It is a 2-stage procedure requiring cartilage biopsy, 4-6 weeks of in vitro chondrocyte expansion, followed by reimplantation. Short- and long-term outcome studies have been promising regarding patient satisfaction and durability. Realignment procedures, as indicated, have been shown to improve clinical outcome and longevity of the transplanted grafts.

The knee is frequently involved and the medial femoral condyle is the most common localization. Predisposing factors are: traumas, inflammatory conditions and biomechanics alterations. Several surgical options are available once correct diagnosis is given and accurate patient evaluation has been performed. The aim of our study was to prospectively evaluate functional results of modified autologous matrix induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) technique in a population of patients affected by focal cartilage defects A population of 17 patients was enrolled in this study. 10 patients were male, mean age at the time of surgery was 39 years, right side was involved in 11 cases. All patients were evaluated with accurate physical exam and complete imaging study. At an average FU of 36 months, mean IKDC score and Lysholm score improved from 32 to 82 and from 38 to 74. 13 patients out of 17 (76.5%) were satisfied or extremely satisfied with their functional result. MRI control showed reduction of the defect area and subchondral oedema in 10 cases (58.8%). AMIC technique is a relatively new option in the treatment of full thickness cartilage lesions. It enhances the advantages of microfractures since the Chondrogide membrane protects and stabilizes the blood plug acting as a matrix for new cartilage formation. First reports on AMIC technique, show comparable results to autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) with the advantage of a single stage technique and no donor site morbidity. AMIC technique represents a new option in the treatment of full thickness cartilage defect. It is safe and reliable. Our data are in accordance with previously reported series in literature and confirm the good objective and subjective results of this procedure.",0

The purpose of this study was to assess whether a combined biomechanical and biological approach could offer good results in unicompartmental OA, thus delaying the need for unicompartmental arthroplasty in patients too young or refusing metal resurfacing. Forty-three patients (mean age = 40.1 +/- A 11 years, 33 men and 10 women, mean BMI = 25 +/- A 3) affected by unicompartmental OA (Kellegren-Lawrence score = 3) in stable joints were enrolled and treated consecutively. Fifteen patients were treated with osteotomy and osteochondral biomimetic scaffold implant (3 of them also with meniscal substitution), 11 with osteotomy and meniscal scaffold implant, 9 with osteotomy and meniscal allograft implant, and 8 with both cartilage and meniscal reconstruction, depending on the specific joint compartment main requirements. Clinical evaluation was performed at 3-year (2-4) median follow-up using the following scoring systems: IKDC subjective and objective, VAS for pain, and Tegner scores. Failures, adverse events, and complications were also reported. The IKDC subjective score improved from 47.3 to 79.6 at the final evaluation (p \textbackslashtextless 0.0005), VAS improved from 6.1 to 2.3 (p \textbackslashtextless 0.0005), and also sport activity level evaluated with the Tegner score showed a significant improvement, from 2 (1-5) to 4 (3-10; p \textbackslashtextless 0.0005), even if without achieving the pre-injury level (6, p = 0.001). A further subanalysis confirmed the positive outcome obtained in all the treatment subgroups and showed a higher clinical improvement in patients under the age of 40 years (IKDC subjective 84.4 +/- A 13.2 vs 76.5 +/- A 17.3; p = 0.03). This integrated biological and biomechanical approach produced a marked improvement at short-medium follow-up in patients affected by unicompartmental OA. Even though a good outcome was achieved at all ages, patients under the age of 40 years presented a greater clinical and subjective improvement. Longer follow-up studies are needed to show results over time and confirm this approach as an effective alternative to unicompartmental implants. Case series, Level IV.",0

The goal of this study was to investigate the retention, adhesion, proliferation, and cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) production of marrow clot-derived cells within a bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived (BMSC-d) ECM/marrow clot composite scaffold. We fabricated BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffolds and kept them in chondrogenic medium in vitro for 1, 3, or 6 weeks. Unmodified marrow clots were used as a control. The BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffold exhibited a porous structure suitable for cell attachment and growth and further maintained cell viability. The DNA content measurements revealed that more cells proliferated in the BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffolds over time than in the marrow clots. Furthermore, the histologic, immunohistochemical, and western blot results demonstrated that the BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffold produced more hyaline-like cartilage and less fibrocartilage than the marrow clot in culture. Taken together, these findings indicate that the porous BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffold promotes the retention, attachment, and proliferation of cells from the marrow clot, and thus can stabilize the marrow clot to support chondrogenesis. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, the combined regeneration of hierarchical osteochondral tissue remains a challenge due to delamination between cartilage and subchondral bone or difficulty in spatial control over differentiation of transplanted stem cells. Here, two types of composite spheroids are prepared using adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) and nanofibers coated with either transforming growth factor-β3 or bone morphogenetic growth factor-2 for chondrogenesis or osteogenesis, respectively. Each type of spheroid is then cultured within a 3D-printed microchamber in a spatially arranged manner to recapitulate the bilayer structure of osteochondral tissue. The presence of inductive factors regionally modulates in vitro chondrogenic or osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs within the biphasic construct without dedifferentiation. Furthermore, hADSCs from each spheroid proliferate and sprout and successfully connect the two layers mimicking the osteochondral interface without apertures. In vivo transplantation of the biphasic construct onto a femoral trochlear groove defect in rabbit knee joint results in 21.2 ± 2.8% subchondral bone volume/total volume and a cartilage score of 25.0 ± 3.7.

Particulated Juvenile Allograft Cartilage (PJAC) has demonstrated promising clinical effect on repairing cartilage. The synergistic effect of synovium and PJAC transplant on meniscal fibrocartilaginous repair is unclear. We hypothesize that the transplantation of synovium and PJAC synergistically facilitates meniscal regeneration and the donor cells within graft tissues still survive in the regenerated tissue at the last follow up (16 weeks postoperatively).The study included 24 mature female rabbits, which were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. A cylindrical full-thickness defect measuring 2.0 ​mm was prepared in the avascular portion of the anterior horn of medial meniscus in both knees. The synovium and PJAC transplant were harvested from juvenile male rabbits (2 months after birth). The experimental group received synovium and PJAC transplant encapsulated with fibrin gel. The control groups received synovium transplant encapsulated with fibrin gel, pure fibrin gel and nothing. The macroscopic, imageological and histological evaluations of repaired tissue were performed at 8 weeks and 16 weeks postoperatively. The in situ hybridization (ISH) of male-specific sex-determining region Y-linked (SRY) gene was performed to detect the transplanted cells.The regenerated tissue in experimental group showed superior structural integrity, superficial smoothness, and marginal integration compared to control groups at 8 weeks or 16 weeks postoperatively. More meniscus-like fibrochondrocytes filled the repaired tissue in the experimental group, and the matrix surrounding these cell clusters demonstrated strongly positive safranin O and type 2 collagen immunohistochemistry staining. By SRY gene ISH, the positive SRY signal of experimental group could be detected at 8 weeks (75.72%, median) and 16 weeks (48.69%, median).

Consequently, a tissue engineering approach to cartilage regenerative therapy could greatly advance the current treatment options for patients with cartilage degeneration and/or defects. A successful tissue engineering approach would require not only induction of chondrogenic differentiation , but also suppression of subsequent endochondral ossification and chondrocyte dedifferentiation . We previously reported that direct injection of the thienoindazole derivative, TD-198946, into the knee joints of mice halted the progression of osteoarthritis; the compound induced chondrogenic differentiation without promoting endochondral ossification. In the present study, we applied TD-198946 to a cell-based cartilage reconstruction model, taking advantage of the cell-sheet technology. Cartilaginous cell-sheets were generated by culturing mouse and canine costal chondrocytes and human mesenchymal stem cells with TD-198946 on temperature-responsive dishes. The transplanted cell-sheets were then successfully used to promote the reconstruction of permanent cartilage, with no evidence of chondrocyte hypertrophy in the knee articular cartilage defects created in mice and canines. Thus, TD-198946 is a promising candidate for cell-based cartilage reconstruction therapies, enabling us to avoid any concern surrounding the use of scaffolds or cytokines to stimulate regeneration.",0

When stimulated, periosteal cells may also differentiate into chondrocytes. However, non-chondrocyte determined cells seem to induce mainly fibrocartilage.

This review analyzes the evidence for and against inclusion of white blood cells, the potential role of platelets, and the less studied potential role of blood plasma when combining these components to create an autologous point-of-care therapy to treat OA. There has been significant focus on the differences between the various autologous therapies. However, evidence suggests that there may be more in common between groups and perhaps we should be thinking of these therapies on a spectrum of the same technology, each providing significant levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines that can be antagonists against the inflammatory cytokines driving OA symptoms and progression. While clinical data have demonstrated symptom alleviation, more studies will need to be conducted to determine whether these preclinical disease-modifying findings translate into clinical practice.",0

In vitro MRI was performed with gradient echo (GRE) and spin echo (SE) sequences at 3T and quantitatively characterized using line profile and region of interest analysis. Ex vivo MRI of hydrogel-encapsulated labeled MSCs implanted within a bovine knee was performed with spoiled GRE (SPGR) and T(1ρ) sequences. Fluorescence microscopy, labeling efficiency, and chondrogenesis of MPIO-labeled cells were also examined.MPIO labeling results in efficient contrast uptake and signal loss that can be visualized and quantitatively characterized via MRI. SPGR imaging of implanted cells results in ex vivo detection within native tissue, and T(1ρ) imaging is unaffected by the presence of labeled cells immediately following implantation. MPIO labeling does not affect quantitative glycosaminoglycan production during chondrogenesis, but iron aggregation hinders extracellular matrix visualization. This aggregation may result from excess unincorporated particles following labeling and is an issue that necessitates further investigation.This study demonstrates the promise of MPIO labeling for monitoring cartilage regeneration and highlights its potential in the development of cell-based tissue engineering strategies.",0

Clinical studies would allow us to establish the correct indications and surgical techniques implanting biocompatible and biodegradable matrices with or without stem cells and growth factors. Arthroscopic techniques with the design of new instruments can facilitate repair of patella and tibial plateau lesions.",0

Autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty has proven to be a valid option for treatment but donor site morbidity with most frequently used autografts remains a source of concern. This study aims to assess clinical results and safety profile of autologous osteochondral graft from the upper tibio-fibular joint applied to reconstruct symptomatic osteochondral lesions of the knee.Thirty-one patients (22 men and 9 women) with grade 4 cartilage lesions in the knee were operated by mosaicplasty technique using autologous osteochondral graft from the upper tibio-fibular joint, between 1998 and 2006. Clinical assessment included visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and Lysholm score. All patients were evaluated by MRI pre- and post-operatively regarding joint congruency as good, fair (inferior to 1 mm incongruence), and poor (incongruence higher than 1 mm registered in any frame). Donor zone status was evaluated according to specific protocol considering upper tibio-fibular joint instability, pain, neurological complications, lateral collateral ligament insufficiency, or ankle complaints.Mean age at surgery was 30.1 years (SD 12.2). In respect to lesion sites, 22 were located in weight-bearing area of medial femoral condyle, 7 in lateral femoral condyle, 1 in trochlea, and 1 in patella. Mean follow-up was 110.1 months (SD 23.2). Mean area of lesion was 3.3 cm2 (SD 1.7), and a variable number of cylinders were used, mean 2.5 (SD 1.3). Mean VAS score improved from 47.1 (SD 10.1) to 20.0 (SD 11.5); p = 0.00. Similarly, mean Lysholm score increased from 45.7 (SD 4.5) to 85.3 (SD 7.0); p = 0.00. The level of patient satisfaction was evaluated, and 28 patients declared to be satisfied/very satisfied and would do surgery again, while 3 declared as unsatisfied with the procedure and would not submit to surgery again. These three patients had lower clinical scores and kept complaints related to the original problem but unrelated to donor zone. MRI score significantly improved at 18-24 months comparing with pre-operative (p = 0.004). No radiographic or clinical complications related to donor zone with implication in activity were registered.This work corroborates that mosaicplasty technique using autologous osteochondral graft from the upper tibio-fibular joint is effective to treat osteochondral defects in the knee joint. No relevant complications related to donor zone were registered.Case series, Level IV.",0

Previous in vitro studies have shown that ascorbic acid and reduced iron independently can improve the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. However, the combined effect of ascorbic acid and iron supplementation on MSC differentiation has not been investigated.To investigate the combined in vivo effects of ascorbic acid and a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved iron supplement on MSC-mediated cartilage repair in mature Göttingen minipigs.Controlled laboratory study.We pretreated bone marrow-derived MSCs with ascorbic acid and the FDA-approved iron supplement ferumoxytol and then transplanted the MSCs into full-thickness cartilage defects in the distal femurs of Göttingen minipigs. Untreated cartilage defects served as negative controls. We evaluated the cartilage repair site with magnetic resonance imaging at 4 and 12 weeks after MSC implantation, followed by histological examination and immunofluorescence staining at 12 weeks.Ascorbic acid plus iron-pretreated MSCs demonstrated a significantly better MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) score (73.8 ± 15.5), better macroscopic cartilage regeneration score according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (8.6 ± 2.0), better Pineda score (2.9 ± 0.8), and larger amount of collagen type II (28,469 ± 21,313) compared with untreated controls (41.3 ± 2.5, 1.8 ± 2.9, 12.8 ± 1.9, and 905 ± 1326, respectively). The obtained scores were also better than scores previously reported in the same animal model for MSC implants without ascorbic acid.Pretreatment of MSCs with ascorbic acid and an FDA-approved iron supplement improved the chondrogenesis of MSCs and led to hyaline-like cartilage regeneration in the knee joints of minipigs.Ascorbic acid and iron supplements are immediately clinically applicable. Thus, these results, in principle, could be translated into clinical applications.",0

After initial success at-bench, most tissue growth strategies are tested in animals. In vivo animal models of cartilage tissue engineering provide a proof-of-concept validation for promising at-bench tissue-growth strategies. A number of animal models such as mice, rats, rabbits, sheep, dogs, and horses have been used for the purpose of validating emerging cartilage tissue-engineering approaches. Out of all the available choices for monitoring cartilage tissue engineering and regeneration in vivo, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most suitable and is the leading imaging modality for noninvasive longitudinal quantitative monitoring of cartilage tissue growth and regeneration.

Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) promises to regenerate hyaline articular cartilage, but conventional ACI is plagued by complications determined by periosteal grafting. Here we propose the utilization of collagen membrane in ACI as an effective bioscaffold for the regeneration of osteochondral lesions. Using a rabbit model of osteochondral injury, we have inoculated autologous chondrocytes onto a type I/III collagen scaffold [so-called matrix-induced ACI (MACI)] and implanted into 3-mm osteochondral knee defects. All untreated defect histology showed inferior fibrocartilage and/or fibrous tissue repair. In our time-course study, ACI with type I/III collagen membrane regenerated cartilage with healthy osteochondral architecture in osteochondral defects at 6 weeks. At 12 weeks, articular cartilage regeneration was maintained, with reduced thickness and proteoglycan compared with the adjacent cartilage. Both 6-week (p < 0.01) and 12-week (p < 0.05) ACI with collagen membrane showed significant improvement as compared with untreated controls. To further examine the efficacy of cartilage regeneration by ACI, we conducted a dose-response study, using chondrocytes at various cell densities between 10(4) and 10(6) cells/cm(2). The results showed that cell density had no effect on outcome histology, but all cell densities were significantly better than untreated controls (p < 0.01) and cell-free collagen membrane treatment (p < 0.05). In short, our data suggest that autologous chondrocyte-seeded type I/III collagen membrane is an effective method for the treatment of focal osteochondral knee injury in rabbits.",0

Even if several strategies exist to treat such damages, the optimal solution has not yet been found. A new strategy represents the scaffold-free spheroid-based autologous chondrocyte transplantation. In this method, spheroids of chondrocytes are synthesized after chondrocyte isolation and expansion, followed by the implantation in a second intervention. Methods Fine Jamshidi-needle biopsies from five patients (one from each patient, Ø 2 mm) treated with a spheroid-based autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) after traumatic lesions of the articular cartilage of the knee were analysed histologically and immunohistologically for collagen II, collagen X and aggrecan expression. The indication for a second look arthroscopy was given by arthrofibrosis or meniscus-lesions, respectively. The time between ACI and second-look arthroscopy ranged between 6 and 16 months. Results In all patients, the histological examinations revealed an avascular cartilage tissue with a homogenic extracellular matrix. The subchondral bone neither showed bleeding, necrosis nor hypertrophy. A homogenous alcian blue staining indicated high amounts of mucopolysaccharides and glycosaminoglycans. Collagen II staining was highly positive, whereas collagen X staining was negative in every patient, ruling out hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation. In addition, intense aggrecan staining indicated a strong expression of this extracellular matrix component. Conclusion The present case series represents the first histological and immunohistological analyses of spheroid-based ACI in humans. Spheroid-based ACI revealed excellent histological results regarding the regeneration of hyaline articular cartilage. These results indicate that spheroid based ACI is a promising strategy for treating traumatic lesions of the articular cartilage of the knee.",0

However, it is difficult for endogenous cells to migrate into ECM derived from native cartilage owing to its nonporous structure and dense nature. Moreover, current decellularization approaches frequently lead to architectural breakdown and potential loss of surface composition of ECM. To solve this problem, we aimed to establish a novel biological ECM scaffold from chondrocyte sheets for cartilage regeneration. We cultured chondrocytes harvested from the auricular cartilage of 4-week-old New Zealand rabbits and enabled them to form cell sheets. These sheets were decellularized using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with three different concentrations, namely, 1%, 5%, and 10%, followed by 1% Triton X-100 and deoxyribonuclease enzyme solution. In vitro microstructural examination and mechanical tests demonstrated that 1% SDS not only removed chondrocytes completely but also maintained the native architecture and composition of ECM, thus avoiding the use of high-concentration SDS. Application of decellularized chondrocyte sheets for osteochondral defects in rabbits resulted in substantial host remodeling and variant regeneration of osteochondral tissues. One percent SDS-treated decellularized chondrocyte sheets contributed to the superior reconstruction of osteochondral defects as compared with 5% and 10% SDS groups, which includes vascularized subchondral bone, articular cartilage with adequate thickness, and integration with host tissues. Furthermore, ECM from 1% SDS significantly increased the migrating potential of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in vitro. RT-PCR and western blot also revealed that ECM increased the expression of SOX-9 in BMSCs, whereas it decreased COL-X expression. In conclusion, our results suggested that the chondrocyte sheets decellularized with 1% SDS preserved the integrity and bioactivity, which favored cell recruitment and enabled osteochondral regeneration in the knee joints of rabbits, thus offering a promising approach for articular cartilage reconstruction without cell transplantation. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Although biological extracellular matrix (ECM) derived from decellularized native cartilage has been widely used in cartilage regeneration, it is difficult for endogenous cells to migrate into ECM owing to its dense nature. Moreover, current decellularization approaches lead to architectural breakdown of ECM. This study established a novel biological ECM from decellularized chondrocyte sheets for cartilage regeneration. Our results suggested that cartilaginous ECM favored cell recruitment and enabled osteochondral regeneration in rabbits, thus offering a promising approach for articular cartilage reconstruction without cell transplantation. SDS 1% adequately decellularized the chondrocytes in cell sheets, whereas it maintained the native architecture and composition of ECM, thereby avoiding the use of high-concentration SDS and providing a new way to acquire cartilaginous ECM.",0

Chondral lesion is a pathology with high prevalence, reaching as much as 63% of general population and 36% among athletes. Despite autologous chondrocyte implantation versatility, it still fails to fully reproduce hyaline articular cartilage characteristics. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be isolated from various known tissues, including discarded fragments at arthroscopy such as synovial membrane. Choice of harvesting site is motivated by MSCs' abilities to modulate immunologic and inflammatory response through paracrine communication. Synovial MSCs have a greater proliferation and strong chondrogenic potential than bone and adipose MSCs and a less hypertrophic differentiation than bone MSCs. Good manufacturing practice (GMP) laboratory techniques for human clinical trials are still novel. To our knowledge, there are only two clinical trials in humans published since today. Purpose: Therefore, this work aimed to isolate and characterize synovial MSCs and evaluated their differentiation properties according to GMP standards. Materials and Methods: One-gram tissue sample from three patients of synovia was harvested at the beginning of arthroscopy surgery. MSCs were isolated, expanded, and characterized by flow cytometry. Results: It was possible to isolate and expand MSCs cultures from synovia, characterize MSCs by flow cytometry using proper monoclonal antibodies, and differentiate MSCs by coloring technique after chondrogenic, adipogenic, and osteogenic differentiations. Cartilage treatment may benefit from these tissue engineering protocols since arthroscopic procedures are routinely performed for different purposes in a previous stage and a favorable chondronegic differentiation cell lineage may be collected and stored in a less invasive way. Conclusion: Laboratory protocols established according to presented GMP were able to isolate and characterize MSCs obtained from synovia. Impact Statement Articular cartilage restoration is a desperately needed bridge for patients with symptomatic cartilage lesions and it rises as a socioeconomic issue with a considerable economic burden. Synovial mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have a greater proliferation rate and strong chondrogenic potential than bone and adipose MSCs and a less hypertrophic differentiation than bone MSCs. To our knowledge, there are only two human clinical trials with good manufacturing practice laboratory techniques for synovial MSCs harvesting and differentiation. Cartilage treatment may benefit from these tissue engineering protocols since arthroscopic procedures are routinely performed for different purposes in a previous stage.",0

Pre-clinical studies are fundamental in translating such therapies; however, technologies to minimally invasively assess in vivo cell fate are currently limited. We investigate the potential of a MRI- (magnetic resonance imaging) and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION)-based technique to monitor cellular bio-distribution in an ovine osteochondral model of acute and chronic injuries. MSCs were isolated, expanded and labelled with Nanomag, a 250-nm SPION, and using a novel cell-penetrating technique, glycosaminoglycan-binding enhanced transduction (GET). MRI visibility thresholds, cellular toxicity and differentiation potential post-labelling were assessed in vitro. A single osteochondral defect was created in the medial femoral condyle in the left knee joint of each sheep with the contralateral joint serving as the control. Cells, either GET-Nanomag labelled or unlabelled, were delivered 1 week or 4.5 weeks later. Sheep were sacrificed 7 days post implantation and immediately MR imaged using a 0.2-T MRI scanner and validated on a 3-T MRI scanner prior to histological evaluation. MRI data demonstrated a significant increase in MRI contrast as a result of GET-Nanomag labelling whilst cell viability, proliferation and differentiation capabilities were not affected. MRI results revealed evidence of implanted cells within the synovial joint of the injured leg of the chronic model only with no signs of cell localisation to the defect site in either model. This was validated histologically determining the location of implanted cells in the synovium. Evidence of engulfment of Nanomag-labelled cells by leukocytes is observed in the injured legs of the chronic model only. Finally, serum c-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured by ELISA with no obvious increase in CRP levels observed as a result of P21-8R:Nanomag delivery. This study has the potential to be a powerful translational tool with great implications in the clinical translation of stem cell-based therapies. Further, we have demonstrated the ability to obtain information linked to key biological events occurring post implantation, essential in designing therapies and selecting pre-clinical models.",0

However, the lack of an ideal double-layer scaffold with osteochondral-biomimetic microenvironment and interface similar to native articular tissue greatly limits clinical translation. Our current study developed a double-layer acellular osteochondral matrix (AOM) scaffold with natural osteochondral-biomimetic microenvironment and interface by integrating ultraviolet (UV) laser and decellularization techniques. The laser parameters were optimized to achieve a proper pore depth close to the osteochondral interface, which guaranteed complete decellularization, sufficient space for cell loading, and relative independence of the chondrogenic and osteogenic microenvironments. Gelatin-methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel was further used as the cell carrier to significantly enhance the efficiency and homogeneity of cell loading in the AOM scaffold with large pore structure. Additionally, in vitro results demonstrated that the components of the AOM scaffold could efficiently regulate the chondrogenic/osteogenic differentiations of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) by activating the chondrogenic/osteogenic related pathways. Importantly, the AOM scaffolds combined with BMSC-laden GelMA hydrogel successfully realized tissue-specific repair of the osteochondral defects in a knee joint model of rabbit. The current study developed a novel double-layer osteochondral biomimetic scaffold and feasible strategy, providing strong support for the tissue-specific repair of osteochondral defects and its future clinical translation.",0

The etiologies of patellofemoral articular cartilage lesions include acute traumatic instability injuries, such as dislocation and subluxation, osteochondritis dissecans, and chronic degenerative changes. Regardless of the etiology, untreated patellofemoral cartilage lesions can contribute to activity-limiting anterior knee pain. The goal of patellofemoral cartilage restoration procedures is to impart symptomatic relief and improve quality of life by repairing the articular cartilage surface and any comorbid malalignment or maltracking. Microfracture and osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT) are two cartilage restoration procedures to consider when treating full-thickness patellofemoral chondral defects. Considered by some experts to be the gold standard therapy, microfracture is one of the most common procedures used for cartilage restoration. The technique involves the perforation of the subchondral bone plate for the release of marrow elements, filling the defect with a fibrocartilage clot repair. Though less commonly used, OAT allows defect replacement with native hyaline cartilage via autologous transplantation from a non-weight bearing area. The purpose of this article is to discuss the indication, technical considerations, and outcomes of microfracture and OAT when used for treating chondral lesions of the patellofemoral joint.",0

Thirty-six medial femoral condyles were divided into 6 groups using different proportion of gene enhanced tissue engineering and mosaicplasty to restore the defects. The specimen received gross and histology observation, which was evaluated by the histological grading scale of O'Driscoll, Keeley and Salter. Transmission electron microscope observation was also performed. Two factors analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Kewls test were used to compare the specimen.The gross and histology observation revealed that each defects of six groups had different restoration. The scores of the reparative tissue of three groups with gene enhancement were significantly higher than those in other three groups without gene enhancement (p > 0.05).Gene enhanced tissue engineering followed mosaicplasty could restore a 9 mm diameter osteochondral defects in a goat model effectively. With the reduction of covering area of the graft, the advantages of the combined gene enhanced tissue engineering method can be better reflected.",0

Emerging technologies seek to advance first generation techniques and accomplish several goals including predictable outcomes, cost-effective technology, single-stage procedures, and creation of durable repair tissue. The biologic pipeline represents a variety of technologies including synthetics, scaffolds, cell therapy, and cell-infused matrices. Synthetic constructs, an alternative to biologic repair, resurface a focal chondral defect rather than the entire joint surface. Scaffolds are cell-free constructs designed as a biologic ""net"" to augment marrow stimulation techniques. Minced cartilage technology uses stabilized autologous or allogeneic fragments in 1-stage transplantation. Second and third generation cell-based methods include alternative membranes, chondrocyte seeding, and culturing onto scaffolds. Despite the promising early results of these products, significant technical obstacles remain along with unknown long-term durability. The vast array of developing technologies has exceptional promise and the potential to revolutionize the cartilage treatment algorithm within the next decade.",0

Symptomatic full-thickness defects in young patients that are located in the medial or lateral femoral condyle, trochlea, or patella and range in size from 3 cm2 to 10 cm2 as well as defects of the ventral talus are indications for autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT). Another indication for ACT are cartilage defects for which previous operative measures have failed. Osteoarthritis and kissing lesions are contraindications. Axial malalignment and knee joint instability need to be corrected. Second-generation ACT procedures are based on three-dimensional biomaterials in which the articular chondrocytes are seeded prior to implantation.

Implantation of autologous LhCG was done at load-bearing regions of the knees in skeletally mature mini-pigs for 6 months. Over the course of this study, significant radiographical improvement in LhCG treated sites was observed via magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, macroscopic repair was effected by LhCG at endpoint. Microscopic inspection revealed that LhCG engraftment restored cartilage thickness, promoted integration with surrounding native cartilage, produced abundant cartilage-specific matrix molecules and re-established an intact superficial tangential zone. Importantly, the repair efficacy of LhCG was quantitatively shown to be comparable to native, unaffected cartilage in terms of biochemical composition and biomechanical properties. There were no complications related to the donor site of cartilage biopsy. Collectively, these results imply that LhCG engraftment may be a viable approach for articular cartilage repair.",0

The fixation techniques were evaluated after 60 and a subsequent 150 motion cycles, focusing on area coverage, outline attachment and scaffold integrity. After the total of 210 cycles, also an endpoint fixation test was performed.The fixation techniques revealed marginal differences for area coverage and outline attachment after 60 and 150 cycles. The FG scored higher on scaffold integrity compared to TS (P<0.05) and CS (P=0.01). Endpoint fixation was highest for the CS, whereas FG showed a weak final fixation strength (P=0.01).This study showed that optimal fixation cannot be combined always with high scaffold integrity.

However, cases of treatment failure with the need for surgical reintervention are reported; typical patient’s individual and environmental risk factors have previously not been described. Hypothesis: The need for reintervention after ACI is associated with specific preoperative detectable individual risk factors. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 413 patients following ACI (first, second, and third generation) were filtered for those who required revision surgery during their follow-up time (2-11.8 years). Factors were analyzed that might have significant effects on increased revision rate. Using preoperatively collected data, all patients were grouped according to 12 standard prognostic factors. Apart from odds ratio and Pearson χ 2 test, statistical analysis of risk factors was performed with multivariate binary logistic regression models and Cox regression, the method of choice for survival time data. Results: After a follow-up of 4.4 ± 0.9 years (limited to 5 years), a total of 88 patients (21.3%) had undergone surgical revision. The time to revision surgery was 1.8 ± 1.1 years. Four prognostic factors associated with a significantly higher risk for reintervention were detected: (1) female gender (Cox survival fit: P = .033), (2) previous surgeries of the affected joint ( P = .002), (3) previous bone marrow stimulation ( P = .041), and (4) periosteum patch–covered ACI ( P = .028). An influence of patient age, body mass index (BMI), defect number, defect size, lesion origin, lesion location, parallel treatment, or smoking on the risk for reintervention could not be observed. Conclusion: The study identifies clear facts that significantly increase the risk of revision surgery. These facts can be easily obtained preoperatively and may be taken into consideration when indicating ACI.",0

The secondary purpose of this review was to improve the quality assessment of studies by modifying the Coleman methodology score (CMS). Study Design Systematic review. Methods For this review, a literature search was performed to identify all published and unpublished clinical studies of matrixassisted (second-generation) autologous chondrocyte transplantation using the following medical electronic databases: MED-LINE, MEDLINE preprints, EMBASE, CINAHL, Life Science Citations, and British National Library of Health, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The search period was January 1, 1995, to July 1, 2008. To better assess cartilage-related studies, a modification of the CMS was proposed. Results Eighteen studies were included in the analysis, reporting on 731 patients with an average follow-up of 27.3 months (6.5-60.0 months). Of the 18 studies, 2 were randomized controlled studies, 3 were prospective comparative studies, 11 were prospective cohort studies or prospective case series, and 2 were retrospective case series. Original CMSs for these studies (55.1 6 1.6) were significantly higher than those of cartilage repair studies in general (43.5 6 1.6, P &lt;.0001) reported in 2005. The statistical analysis indicated that the modified CMS showed higher correlations and lower variability of correlations among 3 reviewers. Conclusion The quality of the currently available data on second-generation autologous chondrocyte transplantation is still limited by study designs. The modified CMS has demonstrated better sensitivity and reproducibility with respect to the original score, so it can be recommended for cartilage clinical studies evaluation.",0

The BMP-4 and chondrogenesis markers were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Thirty rabbits (60 knees) with full-thickness cylinder articular cartilage defects (diameter, 4.5 mm; depth, 0.8 mm) on the femoral trochlea were divided into a group in which the BMP-4--transfected ADSCs were seeded onto PLLGA scaffold and implanted into the defects (group ABNP), a group with untransfected ADSCs seeded onto scaffold (group ABP), and a group with a scaffold without cells (group P). Outcomes were evaluated by histology, Rudert score, Pineda score, and scanning electronic microscopy by 2 blinded observers at weeks 6 and 12 postoperatively. Statistical analyses were performed with analysis of variance and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The statistical significance level was set at P < .05.The expression of chondrogenesis-related genes and proteins was significantly increased in BMP-4--transfected ADSCs in vitro (P < .05). The cell viability was 79.86% ± 5.04% after 24 hours. The transfection efficiency was 25.86% ± 4.27% after 72 hours. Defects in group ABNP showed the best in vivo cartilage regeneration. At week 12, the Rudert scores in group ABNP (7.00 ± 1.75) were better than those in group ABP (6.00 ± 2.00) or group P (5.00 ± 1.75) (P < .05), as were the Pineda scores (2.50 ± 3.00, 5.00 ± 2.00, and 6.00 ± 1.75, respectively; P < .001).BMP-4 plasmid can be successfully delivered into ADSCs by PLGA nanoparticles and promoted in vitro chondrogenesis. When compared with the control cells, BMP-4--transfected ADSCs seeded onto PLLGA scaffold significantly improve in vivo chondrogenesis in a rabbit articular defect model.PLGA nanoparticles and BMP-4 have potential for gene therapy in the treatment of chondral defects of the knee.",0

This review addresses the current surgical treatments and most promising tissue engineering approaches for articular cartilage and subchondral bone regeneration. The capability to repair osteochondral or bone defects remains a challenging goal for surgeons and researchers. So far, most clinical approaches have been shown to have limited capacity to treat severe lesions. Current surgical repair strategies vary according to the nature and size of the lesion and the preference of the operating surgeon. Tissue engineering has emerged as a promising alternative strategy that essentially develops viable substitutes capable of repairing or regenerating the functions of damaged tissue. An overview of novel and most promising osteochondroconductive scaffolds, osteochondroinductive signals, osteochondrogenic precursor cells, and scaffold fixation approaches are presented addressing advantages, drawbacks, and future prospectives for osteochondral regenerative medicine. Tissue engineering has emerged as an excellent approach for the repair and regeneration of damaged tissue, with the potential to circumvent all the limitations of autologous and allogeneic tissue repair.

Drug interventions and surgical treatments have been widely attempted for cartilage regeneration in OA. However, the results were largely unsatisfactory. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) or matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) offers potential for the regeneration of cartilage over the long-term. However, due to the limitations and disadvantages of ACI, alternative therapies for cartilage regeneration are in need. The availability of large quantities of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the multilineage differentiation, especially their chondrogenic differentiation property, have made MSCs the most promising cell source for cartilage regeneration. In addition, MSCs have been shown the ability to undergo site-specific differentiation. MSCs can be obtained as MSC sheets using the temperature-responsive culture dish method. The MSC sheet can provide amounts of cells and extracellular matrix, which might provide the continuity between the implant and host cartilage, thus improving integrative cartilage repair. Moreover, OA is associated with progressive and often severe inflammation. MSCs not only have the ability to contribute structurally to tissue repair, but also possess potent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Taken together, these properties make MSC sheet promising candidate for cartilage repair in OA. We hypothesize that MSC sheet encapsulated cartilage debris can efficiently promote cartilage repair in OA patients. Chondrocytes can be obtained and cultured from small cartilage debris in vitro. Therefore, the chondrocytes may grow from the debris in cartilage defect and improve cartilage regeneration. MSC sheet provide amounts of cells, ECM and protein for cartilage regeneration and integration, and may play some roles of periosteum. The operation of MSC sheet encapsulated cartilage debris for cartilage repair is simple and practical. Moreover, the cell sheet/cartilage debris constructs can be easily shaped based on the size and shape of cartilage defects. The new method might have great potential in treating cartilage defects clinically, especially for OA patients.",0

Thus, the regenerative capacity of a clinically approved hydrogel collagen type I implant was tested in a standardized bovine cartilage punch model.Cartilage rings (outer diameter 6 mm; inner defect diameter 2 mm) were prepared from the bovine trochlear groove. Collagen implants (± bovine chondrocytes) were placed inside the cartilage rings and cultured up to 12 weeks. Cartilage-implant constructs were analyzed by histology (hematoxylin/eosin; safranin O), immunohistology (aggrecan, collagens 1 and 2), and for protein content, RNA expression, and implant push-out force.Cartilage-implant constructs revealed vital morphology, preserved matrix integrity throughout culture, progressive, but slight proteoglycan loss from the ""host"" cartilage or its surface and decreasing proteoglycan release into the culture supernatant. In contrast, collagen 2 and 1 content of cartilage and cartilage-implant interface was approximately constant over time. Cell-free and cell-loaded implants showed (1) cell migration onto/into the implant, (2) progressive deposition of aggrecan and constant levels of collagens 1 and 2, (3) progressively increased mRNA levels for aggrecan and collagen 2, and (4) significantly augmented push-out forces over time. Cell-loaded implants displayed a significantly earlier and more long-lasting deposition of aggrecan, as well as tendentially higher push-out forces.Preserved tissue integrity and progressively increasing cartilage differentiation and push-out forces for up to 12 weeks of cultivation suggest initial cartilage regeneration and lateral bonding of the implant in this in vitro model for cartilage replacement materials.",0

Numerous biomechanical, histological, animal and clinical studies have evaluated the different technical aspects of this procedure. The preoperative work-up encompasses an evaluation of functional disturbances, alignment, knee stability and imaging (CT arthrography or MRI with cartilage sequences). The surgical procedure includes harvesting the grafts by mini-arthrotomy of the medial or lateral trochlea and a stage for arthroscopic graft insertion. The ICRS classification is used to describe the defect (area, depth, location) before and then after debridement. A few, large diameter grafts are harvested from the trochlea across from the defect. The graft plugs are transplanted by press-fit, flush with the cartilage, along a convergent plane in recipient sockets of exactly the same depth. Each stage, harvesting, drilling and insertion is repeated until all the full-thickness gap region has been covered. Postoperative movement is free but weight-bearing is delayed for 2 to 4 weeks. Mosaicplasty is indicated in young patients (under 50), with symptomatic chondral or osteochondral defects of less than 3 cm in the weight-bearing part of the femoral condyle. Pre-osteoarthritis is an absolute contraindictation for this procedure. Any misalignment (of more than 5°) or sagittal instability is treated simultaneously. This is a difficult and demanding procedure.",0

Several surgical techniques for regeneration of the articular cartilage have been proposed. Among them, osteochondral autograft transplantation and 2-step procedures such as autologous chondrocyte implantation have provided good results, promoting formation of new hyaline-like cartilage tissue, whereas other techniques such as microfracture result in fibrous cartilage and a less durable repair. Single-stage cell-based procedures are an attractive treatment option given the potential for cost savings and avoiding a second-stage procedure. We believe that 1-stage cartilage repair in the knee with a hyaluronic acid-based scaffold embedded with mesenchymal stem cells sourced from bone marrow aspirate concentrate has a prominent role in treating chondral defects because this is a simple technique that could improve the care of patients and be cost-effective in the near future.",0

Our aim is to evaluate the mid- and long-term functional outcome of the treatment of osteochondral defects of the knee with autologous osteochondral transplantation with the OATS technique. Thirty-six patients (37 procedures) were included in this study. Twenty-three patients were male and thirteen were female with a mean age of 31.9 years (range: 18-48 years). The cause of the defect was OCD in 10 cases, AVN in 2, lateral patellar maltracking in 7, while in the remaining 17 patients the defect was post-traumatic. The lesion was located on the femoral condyles in 26 cases and the patellofemoral joint in the remaining 11. The average area covered was 2.73 cm(2) (range: 0.8-12 cm(2)) and patients were followed for an average of 36.9 months (range: 18-73 months). The average score in their Tegner Activity Scale was 3.76 (range: 1-8), while their score in Activities of Daily Living Scale of the Knee Outcome Survey ranged from 18 to 98 with an average of 72.3. Thirty-two out of 37 patients (86.5%) reported improvement of their pre-operative symptoms. All but 5 patients returned to their previous occupation while 18 went back to sports. No correlation was found between patient age at operation, the size or site of the chondral lesion and the functional outcome. We believe that autologous osteochondral grafting with the OATS technique is a safe and successful treatment option for focal osteochondral defects of the knee. It offers a very satisfactory functional outcome and does not compromise the patient's future options.",0

Patients and Methods The study involved seven men and five women; their mean age was 35.9 years (14 to 70). All lesions included full-thickness articular cartilage extending through subchondral bone and were associated with subchondral cysts. Medial lesions were exposed through an oblique medial malleolar osteotomy, and one lateral lesion was exposed by expanding an anterolateral arthroscopic portal. After refreshing the subchondral cyst, it was grafted with autologous cancellous bone from the distal tibial metaphysis. The fragments of cartilage were fixed with 5-0 nylon sutures to the surrounding cartilage. Function was assessed at a mean follow-up of 25.3 months (15 to 50), using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot outcome score. The radiological outcome was assessed using MRI and CT scans. Results The mean AOFAS score improved from 65.7 (47 to 81) preoperatively to 92 (90 to 100) at final follow-up, with 100% patient satisfaction. The radiolucent area of the cysts almost disappeared on plain radiographs in all patients immediately after surgery, and there were no recurrences at the most recent follow-up. The medial malleolar screws were removed in seven patients, although none had symptoms. At this time, further arthroscopy was undertaken, when it was found that the mean International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) arthroscopic score represented near-normal cartilage. Conclusion Autologous bone grafting with fixation of chondral fragments preserves the original cartilage in the short term, and could be considered in the treatment for adult patients with symptomatic osteochondral defect and subchondral cysts.

Several surgical procedures have been devised in an attempt to relieve pain, restore function, and delay or stop the progression of cartilaginous lesions. Advanced MRI and ultrasonography protocols are currently used in the evaluation of tissue repair and to improve diagnostic capability. Other nonoperative modalities, such as injection of intra-articular hyaluronic acid or supplementary oral glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, have shown potential efficacy as anti-inflammatory and symptom-modifying agents. The emerging field of tissue engineering, involving the use of a biocompatible, structurally and mechanically stable scaffold, has shown promising early results in cartilage tissue repair. Scaffolds incorporating specific cell sources and bioactive molecules have been the focus in this new exciting field. Further work is required to better understand the behavior of chondrocytes and the variables that influence their ability to heal articular lesions. The future of cartilage repair will probably involve a combination of treatments in an attempt to achieve a regenerative tissue that is both biomechanically stable and, ideally, identical to the surrounding native tissues.",0

Among these, chitosan holds promises both for cartilage and bone healing. The aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate the regeneration potential of a novel hybrid magnesium-doped hydroxyapatite (MgHA), collagen, chitosan-based scaffold, which was tested in a sheep model to ascertain its osteochondral regenerative potential, and in a rabbit model to further evaluate its ability to regenerate bone tissue. Macroscopic, microtomography, histology, histomorphometry, and immunohistochemical analysis were performed. In the sheep model, all analyses did not show significant differences compared to untreated defects (p &gt; 0.05), with no evidence of cartilage and subchondral bone regeneration. In the rabbit model, this bone scaffold provided less ability to enhance tissue healing compared with a commercial bone scaffold. Moreover, persistence of scaffold material and absence of integration with connective tissue around the scaffolds were observed. These results raised some concerns about the osteochondral use of this chitosan composite scaffold, especially for the bone layer. Further studies are needed to explore the best formulation of chitosan-reinforced composites for osteochondral treatment.",0

Totally 54 rabbits were randomly assigned to BMSCs + SF/CS scaffold, SF/CS scaffold and control groups. A cylindrical defect was created at the patellofemoral facet of the right knee of each rabbit and repaired by scaffold respectively. Samples were prepared at 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-surgery for gross observation, hematoxylin-eosin and toluidine blue staining, type II collagen immunohistochemistry, Wakitani histology. The results showed that differentiated BMSCs proliferated well in the scaffold. In the BMSCs + SF/CS scaffold group, the bone defect was nearly repaired, the scaffold was absorbed and immunohistochemistry was positive. In the SF/CS scaffold alone group, fiber-like tissues were observed, the scaffold was nearly degraded and immunohistochemistry was weakly positive. In the control group, the defect was not well repaired and positive immunoreactions were not detected. Modified Wakitani scores were superior in the BMSCs + SF/CS scaffold group compared with those in other groups at 4, 8 and 12 weeks (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). A SF/CS scaffold can serve as carrier for stem cells to repair cartilage defects and may be used for cartilage tissue engineering.",0

These patients were prospectively clinically evaluated at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used for morphologic analysis of the cartilage repair. Biopsy samples were taken from 3 cases during revision surgery, allowing histologic assessment of the repair tissue.The short-term clinical and MRI outcome of this pilot study are modest. No signs of deterioration of the repair tissue were observed. Of the 15 patients followed up during 1 year, 3 (20.0%) showed persistent clinical symptoms or even more clinical symptoms after insertion of the plug. These patients were considered as failures and therefore eligible for revision surgery. During revision surgery, the repair tissue was carefully removed. The remaining osteochondral defect was filled with autologous bone grafts. Immediate and persistent relief of symptoms was observed in all 3 patients. Histologic assessment of biopsy specimens taken during revision surgery showed fibrous vascularized repair tissue with the presence of foreign-body giant cells.The overall short-term clinical and MRI outcome of the osteochondral scaffold plug for cartilage repair in the knee is modest. In this pilot study a modest clinical improvement became apparent at 12 months of follow-up. MRI data showed no deterioration of the repair tissue.

Hypothesis The histologic and immunohistochemical appearance of the repair tissues in failed articular cartilage resurfacing procedures will be similar, regardless of the procedure that was done, and will not resemble normal articular cartilage. Study Design Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods Graft tissue from 10 patients who underwent an autologous chondrocyte implantation (n = 6), microfracture (n = 3), or periosteal transplantation (n = 1) procedure to treat symptomatic osteochondritis dissecans of the medial femoral condyle was processed for histologic examination after failure of the articular cartilage resurfacing procedure. Serial sections from all slabs were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and toluidine blue and were immunostained using antibodies directed against types I, II, and X collagen. Results Specimens from all 3 types of repair procedures were composed primarily of fibrous connective tissue and fibrocartilage. None of the sections stained positively for type X collagen. All 10 cases stained positively for type I collagen (range, 7%–97% of tissue area). Staining for type II collagen was positive in 4 of 6 autologous chondrocyte implantation cases, 3 of 3 microfracture cases, and the periosteal transplant case (range, 2%–65% of tissue area).

Cementless implants are widely used in clinics to replace damaged cartilage or missing bone tissue. In cementless arthroplasty, the risk of aseptic loosening strictly depends on implant stability and bone-implant interface, which are fundamental to guarantee the long-term success of the implant. Ameliorating the features of prosthetic materials, including their porosity and/or geometry, and identifying osteoconductive and/or osteoinductive coatings of implant surfaces are the main strategies to enhance the bone-implant contact surface area. Herein, the development of a novel composite consisting in the association of macro-porous trabecular titanium with silk fibroin (SF) sponges enriched with anionic fibroin-derived polypeptides is described. This composite is applied to improve early bone ingrowth into the implant mesh in a sheep model of bone defects. The composite enables to nucleate carbonated hydroxyapatite and accelerates the osteoblastic differentiation of resident cells, inducing an outward bone growth, a feature that can be particularly relevant when applying these implants in the case of poor osseointegration. Moreover, the osteoconductive properties of peptide-enriched SF sponges support an inward bone deposition from the native bone towards the implants. This technology can be exploited to improve the biological functionality of various prosthetic materials in terms of early bone fixation and prevention of aseptic loosening in prosthetic surgery.",0

However, much less is known about third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation application in high-level athletes. We report on the two-year follow-up outcome after matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation to treat a large cartilage lesion of the lateral femoral condyle in a male Caucasian professional football player.Case presentationA 27-year-old male Caucasian professional football player was previously treated for cartilage problems of his left knee with two failed microfracture procedures resulting in a 9 cm2 Outerbridge Grade 4 chondral lesion at his lateral femoral condyle. Preoperative Tegner-Lysholm and Brittberg-Peterson scores were 64 and 58, and by the second year they were 91 and 6. An evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated filling of the defect with the signal intensity of the repair tissue resembling healthy cartilage. Second-look arthroscopy revealed robust, smooth cartilage covering his lateral femoral condyle. He returned to his former competitive level without restrictions or complaints one year after the procedure.ConclusionsThis case illustrates that robust cartilage tissue can be obtained with a matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation procedure even after two failed microfracture procedures in a large (9 cm2) cartilage defect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report on the application of the third-generation cell therapy treatment technique, matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation, in a professional football player.",0

Our purpose is to report outcomes in a cohort of patients undergoing impaction bone grafting for treatment of knee OCD.Patients undergoing impaction bone grafting for knee OCD between 1998 and 2011 were contacted and stratified into (a) those who have undergone subsequent surgery on the affected knee and (b) those who have not had revision surgery performed on the affected knee since the impaction bone grafting procedure. For those not undergoing another procedure, physical examination, radiographs, MRI, and functional outcomes (SF12, Tegner, Activity Rating Scale, and IKDC) were obtained.Of nine patients (10 knees) undergoing the procedure, seven (eight knees) were available for follow-up. Three had revision surgery. One had debridement due to surface overgrowth and had no symptoms 43months following debridement, while two had osteochondral allograft and autograft procedures at three and 10years after initial surgery, respectively. Four patients did not require a revision surgical procedure at average follow-up of 55.4months (range, 21-116months). All had complete MRI fill of the cartilaginous defect with less than 50% of surface irregularity and redeveloped the tidemark and a heterogeneous cartilaginous surface. Follow-up Tegner, ARS, and SF12-PCS averaged 6.8, 67.5, and 56.6, respectively. All four had good/excellent IKDC results.Impaction bone grafting can reliably restore osteocartilaginous defect produced by OCD and is a readily available and less-expensive option in treating OCD lesions. Further investigation is necessary to determine the long-term durability of the results. Level IV - Case series.",0
124,https://openalex.org/W2437312588,,[New therapy procedure for localized cartilage defects. Encouraging results with autologous chondrocyte implantation].,"Owing to the poor regenerative capacity of cartilage, cartilaginous defects are considered to represent pre-arthrotic factors. In addition to autologous and allogenic osteochondral fragments, proliferative tissue, such as periosteum and perichondrium are increasingly being used as graft material. The aim of treatment is to eliminate the defect and to restore the load-bearing capacity and function of the affected joint. A new, recently introduced, approach aims to stimulate the formation of new cartilage via autologous cultured chondrocyte implantation (ACI). The rationale for this treatment is the restoration of loadable hyaline or hyaline-like articular cartilage. Although long-term results are not yet available, clinical follow-up data obtained so far are encouraging. In addition to existing methods of treating cartilaginous defects, this article describes a modified method of transplantation of autologous chondrocytes. With this method the periosteal flap used to cover a defect is replaced by an absorbable collagenl/III membrane (Chondrogide, Geistlich Wolhusen, Switzerland) that is used as a carrier for the patient's own chondrocytes. After placement in the defect, the membrane is fixed in place with fibrin glue (MACI).",0

Meanwhile, non-invasive imaging techniques were use to track SPIO-labeled MSCs by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Human bone marrow MSCs were cultured and labeled with SPIO. Fresh degenerated human osteochondral fragments were obtained during total knee arthroplasty and a cartilage defect was created at the center. Then, the osteochondral fragments were attached to the sidewalls of culture flasks filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to mimic the human joint cavity. The SPIO-labeled MSCs were injected into the culture flasks in the presence of a 0.57 Tesla (T) magnetic force. Before and 90 min after cell targeting, the specimens underwent T-2-weighted turbo spin-echo (SET2WI) sequence of 3.0 T MRI. MRI results were compared with histological findings. Macroscopic observation showed that SPIO-labeled MSCs were steered to the target region of cartilage defect. MRI revealed significant changes in signal intensity (P\textbackslashtextless0.01). HE staining exibited that a great number of MSCs formed a three-dimensional (3D) cell “sheet” structure at the chondral defect site. It was concluded that 0.57 T magnetic force permits spatial delivery of magnetically labeled MSCs to the target region in vitro. High-field MRI can serve as an very sensitive non-invasive technique for the visualization of SPIO-labeled MSCs.",0

Many processes can result in cartilage injury, ranging from acute trauma to degenerative processes. Articular cartilage lacks vascularity, and therefore most chondral defects do not heal spontaneously and may require surgical repair. A variety of cartilage repair techniques have been developed and include bone marrow stimulation (microfracture), osteochondral autograft transfer system (OATS) or osteochondral allograft transplantation, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), matrix-assisted chondrocyte implantation (MACI), and other newer processed allograft cartilage techniques. Although arthroscopy has long been considered as the gold standard for evaluation of cartilage after cartilage repair, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a non-invasive method to assess the repair site and can be scored using Magnetic resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART). MR also provides additional evaluation of the subchondral bone and for other potential causes of knee pain or internal derangement. Conventional MR can be used to evaluate the status of cartilage repair and potential complications. Compositional MR sequences can provide supplementary information about the biochemical contents of the reparative tissue. This article reviews the various types of cartilage repair surgeries and their postoperative MR imaging appearances.",0

The cell-scaffold construct is implanted in the debrided cartilage defect and fixed only with fibrin glue, with no periosteal cover or further surgical fixation. In a clinical pilot study, the MACI technique was used for the treatment of full-thickness, weight-bearing chondral defects of the femoral condyle in 16 patients. All patients were followed prospectively and the early postoperative attachment rate, 34.7 days (range: 22-47) after the scaffold implantation, was determined. With the use of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the transplant was graded as completely attached, partially attached, or detached. In 14 of 16 patients (87.5%), a completely-attached graft was found, and the cartilage defect site was totally covered by the implanted scaffold and repair tissue. In one patient (6.25%), a partial attachment occurred with partial filling of the chondral defect. A complete detachment of the graft was found in one patient (6.25%), which resulted in an empty defect site with exposure of the subchondral bone. Interobserver variability for the MRI grading of the transplants showed substantial agreement (kappa=0.775) and perfect agreement (kappa(w)=0.99). In conclusion, the implantation and fixation of a cell-scaffold construct in a deep cartilage defect of the femoral condyle with fibrin glue and with no further surgical fixation leads to a high attachment rate 34.7 days after the implantation, as determined with high resolution MRI.",0

Treatment depends on identification of the size and location of the lesion. The other entity is an osteonecrosis-like lesion of the tibial plateau. It usually occurs medially and may not be associated with radiographic changes. However, increased uptake on a bone scan from the medial side of the knee, best noted on the lateral view, will identify these lesions.

We transplanted synovial MSCs into cartilage defects using a simple method and investigated its usefulness and repair process in a pig model.The chondrogenic potential of the porcine MSCs was compared in vitro. Cartilage defects were created in both knees of seven pigs, and divided into MSCs treated and non-treated control knees. Synovial MSCs were injected into the defect, and the knee was kept immobilized for 10 min before wound closure. To visualize the actual delivery and adhesion of the cells, fluorescence-labeled synovial MSCs from transgenic green fluorescent protein (GFP) pig were injected into the defect in a subgroup of two pigs. In these two animals, the wounds were closed before MSCs were injected and observed for 10 min under arthroscopic control. The defects were analyzed sequentially arthroscopically, histologically and by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for 3 months.Synovial MSCs had a higher chondrogenic potential in vitro than the other MSCs examined. Arthroscopic observations showed adhesion of synovial MSCs and membrane formation on the cartilage defects before cartilage repair. Quantification analyses for arthroscopy, histology and MRI revealed a better outcome in the MSC-treated knees than in the non-treated control knees.Leaving a synovial MSC suspension in cartilage defects for 10 min made it possible for cells to adhere in the defect in a porcine cartilage defect model. The cartilage defect was first covered with membrane, then the cartilage matrix emerged after transplantation of synovial MSCs.",0

Biomechanical data have shown that blood causes harmful effects on overall cartilage function under loading conditions. Therefore, haemophilic patients suffering a haemarthrosis should be subjected to blood aspiration (arthrocentesis) to prevent cartilage damage. MRI and ultrasonography have shown themselves to be excellent noninvasive tools for the evaluation of early cartilage damage that remains undetectable by conventional radiography in haemophilic patients. Prophylaxis with the deficient factor can prevent cartilage deterioration and reduce the incidence of joint haemorrhage in children with haemophilia. Radiosynovectomy has proved to be a highly effective procedure to decrease both the frequency and the severity of recurrent intra-articular bleeding episodes. Nowadays, the most usual surgical procedures for treating articular cartilage defects (cartilage repair) include abrasion chondroplasty, microfracture, mosaicplasty, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), and matrix-induced ACI. In small defects (<2-4 cm(2)), ostechondral autograft or microfracture are the recommended options. In large defects (>2-4 cm(2)), ACI or osteochondral allograft are indicated. However, these techniques have not been applied in haemophilic patients because inflammatory conditions and advanced degenerative change (>50% joint space narrowing) are contraindications for cartilage repair. Thus, prevention of cartilage damage is paramount in haemophilia. The definitive remedy for advanced cartilage damage is either (knee or hip) replacement or (ankle) arthrodesis. Primary prophylaxis and radiosynovectomy are the best alternatives at our disposal to protect our patients against cartilage damage and arthropathy in haemophilic joints.",0

Because a functional interaction between cartilage and bone is crucial, the pathophysiology of OA and its treatment strategy must focus also on subchondral bone. We investigated whether adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) injected into a joint at two different concentrations could prevent subchondral bone damage after the onset of mild OA in a rabbit model. We measured both volumetric and densitometric aspects of bone remodeling. Although OA can stimulate bone remodeling either catabolically or anabolically over time, the accelerated turnover does not allow complete mineralization of new bone and therefore gradually reduces its density. We measured changes in morphometric and densitometric bone parameters using micro-CT analysis and correlated them with the corresponding parameters in cartilage and meniscus. We found that ASCs promoted cartilage repair and helped counteract the accelerated bone turnover that occurs with OA.",0

Small animal imaging models are widely available and practical but insufficiently depict important morphologic detail. In contrary, large animal models are logistically challenging and costly but offer greater imaging quality. In order to combine the advantages of both, we developed an intermediate-sized rabbit animal model for cartilage imaging studies. Procedures Rabbit mesenchymal stem cells (rMSC) were isolated as primary cultures from the bone marrow of New Zealand white rabbits. rMSC were subsequentially transduced lentivirally with eGFP and magnetically labeled with the iron oxide ferucarbotran. eGFP expression was evaluated by flow cytometry and iron uptake was analyzed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry and Prussian blue staining. Fluorescence microscopy of eGFP-transduced rMSC was performed. Viability and induction of apoptosis were assessed by XTT and caspase-3/-7 measurements. The chondrogenic potential of labeled cells was quantified by glycosaminoglycan contents in TGF-beta 3 induced pellet cultures. Labeled and unlabeled cells underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 T before and after differentiation using T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted pulse sequences. Relaxation rates were calculated. rMSCs were implanted in fibrin clots in osteochondral defects of cadaveric rabbit knees and imaged by 7 T MRI. T2* maps were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple regression models. Results Efficiency of lentiviral transduction was greater than 90 %. Fluorescence signal was dose dependent. Cellular iron uptake was significant for all concentrations (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05) and dose dependent (3.3-56.5 pg Fe/cell). Labeled rMSC showed a strong, dose-dependent contrast on all MR pulse sequences and a significant decrease in T2 and T2* relaxation rates. Compared with non-transduced or unlabeled controls, there were no adverse effects on cell viability, rate of apoptosis, or chondrogenic differentiation. MRI of labeled rMSCs in osteochondral defects showed a significant signal of the transplant with additional high-resolution anatomical information. Conclusions This intermediate-sized rabbit model and its bifunctional labeling technique allow for improved depiction of anatomic detail for noninvasive in vivo rMSC tracking with MRI and for immunohistological correlation by fluorescence microscopy.",0

In this study, self-assembling tissue intermediates (TIs) derived from human periosteum-derived stem/progenitor cells (hPDCs) were generated and validated for stable cartilage formation in vivo using two different animal models. hPDCs were aggregated and cultured in the presence of a novel growth factor (GF) cocktail comprising of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)2, growth differentiation factor (GDF)5, BMP6, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to study in vitro differentiation. Aggregates were then implanted ectopically in nude mice and orthotopically in critical-size osteochondral defects in nude rats and evaluated by microcomputed tomography (µCT) and immunohistochemistry. Gene expression analysis after 28 days of in vitro culture revealed the expression of early and late chondrogenic markers and a significant upregulation of NOGGIN as compared to human articular chondrocytes (hACs). Histological examination revealed a bilayered structure comprising of chondrocytes at different stages of maturity. Ectopically, TIs generated both bone and mineralized cartilage at 8 weeks after implantation. Osteochondral defects treated with TIs displayed glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production, type-II collagen, and lubricin expression. Immunostaining for human nuclei protein suggested that hPDCs contributed to both subchondral bone and articular cartilage repair. Our data indicate that in vitro derived osteochondral-like tissues can be generated from hPDCs, which are capable of producing bone and cartilage ectopically and behave orthotopically as osteochondral units.",0

However, due to its anisotropic spatial architecture, complex biomechanical microenvironment, and limited vascularity, meniscus repair remains a challenge for clinicians and researchers worldwide. In this study, we developed a 3D printing-based biomimetic and composite tissue-engineered meniscus scaffold consisting of polycaprolactone (PCL)/silk fibroin (SF) with extraordinary biomechanical properties and biocompatibility. We hypothesized that the meticulously tailored composite scaffold could enhance meniscus regeneration and cartilage protection. Methods: The physical property of the scaffold was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation, degradation test, frictional force of interface assessment, biomechanical testing, and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis. To verify the biocompatibility of the scaffold, the viability, morphology, proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) production of synovium-derived mesenchymal stem cell (SMSC) on the scaffolds were assessed by LIVE/DEAD staining, alamarBlue assay, ELISA analysis, and qRT-PCR. The recruitment ability of SMSC was tested by dual labeling with CD29 and CD90 by confocal microscope at 1 week after implantation. The functionalized hybrid scaffold was then implanted into the meniscus defects on rabbit knee joint for meniscus regeneration, comparing with the Blank group (no scaffold) and PS group. The regenerated meniscus tissue was evaluated by histological and immunohistochemistry staining, and biomechanical test. Macroscopic and histological scoring was performed to assess the outcome of meniscus regeneration and cartilage protection in vivo. Results: The combination of SF and PCL could greatly balance the biomechanical properties and degradation rate to match the native meniscus. SF sponge, characterized by fine elasticity and low interfacial shear force, enhanced energy absorption capacity of the meniscus and improved chondroprotection. The SMSC-specific affinity peptide (LTHPRWP; L7) was conjugated to the scaffold to further increase the recruitment and retention of endogenous SMSCs. This meticulously tailored scaffold displayed superior biomechanics, structure, and function, creating a favorable microenvironment for SMSC proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) production. After 24 weeks of implantation, the histological assessment, biochemical contents, and biomechanical properties demonstrated that the polycaprolactone/silk fibroin-L7 (PS-L7) group was close to the native meniscus group, showing significantly better cartilage protection than the PS group. Conclusion: This tissue engineering scaffold could greatly strengthen meniscus regeneration and chondroprotection. Compared with traditional cell-based therapies, the meniscus tissue engineering approach with advantages of one-step operation and reduced cost has a promising potential for future clinical and translational studies.",0

It can reduce ankle pain and allow performance of daily living activities and elementary sports. However, there are very little data on the restoration of normal life with large lesions. Our investigation focused on assessing outcomes in patients with large lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS The MOT operation was used, and the donor site was located at the lateral condyle of the femur. Clinical evaluation included the Berndt and Harty outcome question, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score (during rest, walking and running), American Orthopedic Foot and ankle Association (AOFAS) score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation form, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36). Twenty-four months after surgery, the graft binding was assessed by MRI using the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score. RESULTS We assessed 26 patients, including 14 males and 12 females. The average follow-up time was 33.9±5.2 months. The average lesion size was 173.1±23.5 mm². The average VAS score during rest improved from 4.62±0.85 preoperatively to 1.08±0.27 postoperatively (P<0.05), the score during walking improved from 5.19±0.63 preoperatively to 1.15±0.37 postoperatively (P<0.05), and the score during running improved from 6.08±0.74 preoperatively to 1.39±0.57 postoperatively (P<0.05). The average postoperative AOFAS ankle score improved to 91.5±2.6 (range, 88 to 96), compared with preoperative 75.0±2.8 (range, 70 to 79) (P<0.05). Two patients developed pain in the donor site of the knee joint, and both of them had 2 or more osteochondral plugs harvested. The postoperative SF-36 score increased to 92.2±2.4 (P<0.05). In the last follow-up, 18 patients answered the Berndt and Harty outcome question, all with good as the result. CONCLUSIONS MOT is a feasible choice for patients with larger lesions. It can improve the VAS/AOFAS/IKDC/SF-36 scores, and has high patient satisfaction. Graft incorporation helps improve patient quality of life. Our results indicate that a larger osteochondral plug area increases the risk of developing knee donor site pain.",0

Pending techniques include two-staged cell-based therapies integrated into a variety of scaffolds, single-stage cell-based therapy, and augmentation of marrow stimulation, each with suggested indications including lesion size, location, and activity demands of the patient. The literature demonstrates variable improvements in pain and function contingent upon multiple variables including indications and application.For the patient with symptomatic chondral injury, numerous techniques are available to the surgeon to relieve pain and improve function.

While tissue-engineered cartilage constructs have shown efficacy in repairing focal cartilage defects in animal models, a substantial number of cells are required to generate sufficient quantities of tissue for the repair of larger defects. In a previous study, we developed a novel approach to generate large, scaffold-free cartilaginous constructs from a small number of donor cells (20 000 cells to generate a 3-cm(2) tissue construct). As comparable thicknesses to native cartilage could be achieved, the purpose of the present study was to assess the ability of these constructs to survive implantation as well as their potential for the repair of critical-sized chondral defects in a rabbit model. Evaluated up to 6 months post-implantation, allogenic constructs survived weight bearing without a loss of implant fixation. Implanted constructs appeared to integrate near-seamlessly with the surrounding native cartilage and also to extensively remodel with increasing time in vivo. By 6 months post-implantation, constructs appeared to adopt both a stratified (zonal) appearance and a biochemical composition similar to native articular cartilage. In addition, constructs that expressed superficial zone markers displayed higher histological scores, suggesting that transcriptional prescreening of constructs prior to implantation may serve as an approach to achieve superior and/or more consistent reparative outcomes. As the results of this initial animal study were encouraging, future studies will be directed toward the repair of chondral defects in more mechanically demanding anatomical locations.",0

Twenty patients underwent ACI of the talus alone; 9 underwent ACI with bone grafting of underlying cysts. Follow-up was performed at a mean of 70 months (range, 24-129 months). Patient outcomes were evaluated using the simplified symptomatology score, Tegner activity score, Finsen score, and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score. Twenty-five patients (86%) underwent second-look arthroscopic surgery at the time of hardware removal and were assessed with the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 24 patients (83%) and compared with preoperative MRI scans. Results: Preoperatively, 26 patients rated their ankles as poor and 3 as fair using the simplified symptomatology score. At last follow-up, 9 were classified as excellent, 14 as good, 5 as fair, and 1 as poor using the same score. The mean AOFAS score improved from 50.1 to 85.9 (range, 65-100). The mean Tegner activity score improved from 1.6 to 4.3 ( P &lt; .0001). The mean Finsen score (modified Weber score) showed significant improvement from 13.7 to 5.1 ( P &lt; .0001). Conclusion: Autologous chondrocyte implantation of the talus yields improvement in all parameters tested with enduring long-term results in patients who have failed previous surgery for OLTs.",0

Freeze-dried (FD) chitosan formulations were optimized to produce ultraporous cylinders that slowly rehydrate and disperse into bioactive chitosan microparticles in coagulating blood plasma. FD-chitosan implants (80% Degree of Deacetylation, 85 kDa) were produced at 3 doses (initial concentrations of 5, 10, 20 mg/mL, pH 2.5). Full-thickness cartilage defects were created bilaterally in medial femoral condyles of 8–9 year-old sheep (N = 12), microdrilled with 11 holes, then in one knee per sheep, one implant cylinder was inserted into each bleeding drill hole. At 1 day (N = 2), 3 months (N = 5) and 9 months (N = 5) post-operative, repair tissues were analyzed macroscopically and by micro-computed tomography, histology, biochemistry, and mechanics. Chitosan microparticles were detected in day 1 subchondral blood clots and mostly cleared at 3 months. At 3 months, microdrill holes were 2-fold larger, filled with angiogenic granulation tissue, callus, and woven bone, with more chondroinduction in treated versus control drill holes (p = 0.021). At 9 months, biomaterial treatment enhanced bone plate repair and stimulated 68% cartilage resurfacing vs 53% for drill-only controls (p = 0.047). Both treated and control cartilage repair tissues had lower glycosaminoglycan content than intact cartilage and were thinner, stiffer, and more permeable. Upon indentation, hyaline-like repair cartilage showed poroelastic behavior. This study showed that FD-chitosan can be locally delivered to incorporate chitosan microparticles into subchondral bone blood clots and exert anabolic therapeutic effects on articular cartilage resurfacing in aged sheep knees.",0

Design A literature search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Patients were included if they possessed a chondral defect of the humeral head, glenoid, or both, which had been treated with a joint preserving nonarthroplasty procedure. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies scoring system. Study demographics, surgical technique, imaging findings, patient-reported outcomes, complications, failures, and reoperations were collected. Results Fourteen studies with 98 patients (100 shoulders) met the inclusion criteria. Patient ages ranged from 7 to 74 years. The nonarthroplasty surgical techniques utilized included microfracture (67 shoulders), osteochondral transplantation (28 shoulders), chondrocyte transplantation (4 shoulders), and internal fixation (1 shoulder). The rates of radiographic union and progression of osteoarthritis ranged between 90% to 100% and 57% to 100%, respectively. Visual analog scores ranged from 0 to 1.9 at final follow-up. Mean postoperative ASES (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons) shoulder scores ranged from 75.8-100. Mean postoperative CSS (Constant Shoulder Score) scores ranged from 83.3-94. Mean postoperative SSV (Subjective Shoulder Value) ranged from 70% to 99%. Failure and reoperation rates ranged between 0% to 35% and 0% to 30%, respectively, with the most common reoperation being conversion to prosthetic arthroplasty. Conclusions In this systematic review, nonarthroplasty surgical techniques demonstrated acceptable rates of radiographic healing, improved patient reported outcomes, minimal complications, and low rates of failure or reoperation. Joint preserving techniques are likely viable options to prolong function of the native shoulder and provide short- to midterm pain relief in young and highly active patients.

Although the hydrogel scaffolds developed to date possess many favorable characteristics, achieving the required mechanical properties has remained a challenge. A hydrogel system with tunable mechanical properties, composed of a mixture of natural and synthetic polymers, and its use for the encapsulation of adipose derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) is described. Solutions of methacrylated chondroitin sulfate (MCS) are mixed with solutions of acrylate-poly(trimethylene carbonate)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(trimethylene carbonate)-acrylate (PEG-(PTMC-A)2 ) in phosphate buffered saline and crosslinked via thermally initiated free radical polymerization. The hydrogel compressive equilibrium moduli and toughness are readily tailored by varying the concentration of the pre-polymers, as well as the molecular weight of the PEG used to prepare the PEG-(PTMC-A)2 . Two peptide sequences, GVOGEA and GGGGRGDS, are individually conjugated to the MCS to facilitate cell binding. The presence of the peptide ligands yields high ASC viability and long term metabolic activity following encapsulation in hydrogels prepared using the thermal initiator system. Overall, these hydrogels show promise as a minimally invasive ASC delivery strategy for chondral defect repair.",0

Cells were propagated in vitro in monolayer culture for 10 days and packed within diffusion chambers (10(6)/chamber) together with type I collagen (CI) and 0, 1, or 10 microg rHuBMP-2, and implanted into abdominal subfascial pockets of adult rats. Tissue pellets were harvested from the diffusion chambers at 2 days to 6 weeks after implantation, and examined by histology, by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for aggrecan, CII, CIX, CX, and CXI, MyoD1, and core binding factor a1/runt-related gene 2, and by real-time PCR for CII. Tissue pellets generated in the chamber 5 weeks after implantation were transplanted into a full-thickness cartilage defect made in the patellar groove of the same strain of adult rat.In the presence of 10 microg rHuBMP-2, muscle-derived mesenchymal cells expressed CII messenger RNA at 4 days after transplantation, and a mature cartilage mass was formed 5 weeks after transplantation in the diffusion chamber. Cartilage was not formed in the presence of 1 microg rHuBMP-2 or in the absence of rHuBMP-2. Defects receiving cartilage engineered with 10 microg rHuBMP-2 were repaired and restored to normal morphologic condition within 6 months after transplantation.This method of tissue engineering for repair of articular defects may preclude the need to harvest cartilage tissue prior to mosaic arthroplasty or autologous chondrocyte implantation. Further studies in large animals will be necessary to validate this technique for application in clinical practice.",0

We hypothesized that dispersed chitosan particles implanted close to the bone marrow degrade in situ in a molecular mass-dependent manner, and attract more stromal cells to the site in aged rabbits compared to the blood clot in untreated controls.Three microdrill hole defects, 1.4 mm diameter and 2 mm deep, were created in both knee trochlea of 30 month-old New Zealand White rabbits. Each of 3 isotonic chitosan solutions (150, 40, 10 kDa, 80% degree of deaceylation, with fluorescent chitosan tracer) was mixed with autologous rabbit whole blood, clotted with tissue factor to form cylindrical implants, and press-fit in drill holes in the left knee while contralateral holes received tissue factor or no treatment. At day 1 or day 21 post-operative, defects were analyzed by micro-computed tomography, histomorphometry and stereology for bone and soft tissue repair.All 3 implants filled the top of defects at day 1 and were partly degraded in situ at 21 days post-operative. All implants attracted neutrophils, osteoclasts and abundant bone marrow-derived stromal cells, stimulated bone resorption followed by new woven bone repair (bone remodeling) and promoted repair tissue-bone integration. 150 kDa chitosan implant was less degraded, and elicited more apoptotic neutrophils and bone resorption than 10 kDa chitosan implant. Drilled controls elicited a poorly integrated fibrous or fibrocartilaginous tissue.Pre-solidified implants elicit stromal cells and vigorous bone plate remodeling through a phase involving neutrophil chemotaxis. Pre-solidified chitosan implants are tunable by molecular mass, and could be beneficial for augmented marrow stimulation therapy if the recruited stromal cells can progress to bone and cartilage repair.",0

However, there are major concerns, in particular, the viability and quality of the chondrocytes. This study investigated the biochemistry and molecular characterization of chondrocytes isolated from preserved cartilage for purposes of transplantation. Ex vivo characterization was accomplished by storing human cartilage at either 4 or -80 A degrees C in a preservation medium. Microscopic evaluation of the preserved cartilage was conducted after 1, 2, 3 and 6 weeks. The chondrocytes were isolated from the preserved cartilage and investigated for proliferation capacity and chondrogenic phenotype. Transplantation of chondrocytes from preserved cartilage into rabbit knees was performed for purposes of in vivo evaluation. The serum cartilage degradation biomarker (WF6 epitopes) was evaluated during the transplantation procedure. Human cartilage preserved for 1 week in a 10 % DMSO chondrogenic medium at 4 A degrees C gave the highest chondrocyte viability. The isolated chondrocytes showed a high proliferative capacity and retained chondrogenic gene expression. Microscopic assessment of the implanted rabbit knees showed tissue regeneration and integration with the host cartilage. A decreased level of the serum biomarker after transplantation was evidence of in vivo repair by the implanted chondrocytes. These results suggest that cartilage preservation for 1 week in a 10 % DMSO chondrogenic medium at 4 A degrees C can maintain proliferation capacity and the chondrogenic phenotype of human chondrocytes. These results can potentially be applied to in vivo allogeneic chondrocyte transplantation. Allogeneic chondrocytes from preserved cartilage would be expected to maintain their chondrogenic phenotype and to result in a high rate of success in transplanted grafts.",0

Microfracture is a surgical technique used to treat such defects. This technique involves penetration of subchondral bone to release progenitor cells and growth factors from the marrow to promote cartilage regeneration. Often this results in fibrocartilage formation rather than structured hyaline cartilage. Some reports have suggested use of growth hormone (GH) with microfracture to augment cartilage regeneration. Our objective was to test whether intra-articular (IA) GH in conjunction with microfracture, improves cartilage repair in a rabbit chondral defect model. We hypothesized that GH would exhibit a dose-dependent improvement in regeneration. Design Sixteen New Zealand white rabbits received bilateral femoral chondral defects and standardized microfracture repair. One group of animals ( n = 8) received low-dose GH by IA injection in the left knee, and the other group ( n = 8) received high-dose GH in the same manner. All animals received IA injection of saline in the contralateral knee as control. Serum assays, macroscopic grading, and histological analyses were used to assess any improvements in cartilage repair. Results Peripheral serum GH was not elevated postoperatively ( P = 0.21). There was no improvement in macroscopic grading scores among either of the GH dosages ( P = 0.83). Scoring of safranin-O-stained sections showed no improvement in cartilage regeneration and some evidence of increased bone formation in the GH-treated knees. Conclusions Treatment with either low- or high-dose IA GH does not appear to enhance short-term repair in a rabbit chondral defect model.",0

The expression of cartilage-specific genes (col II, aggrecan, and Sox9) and fibroblast growth factor receptor genes was tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction in vitro. Also, full-thickness cartilage defects (diameter 4 mm, thickness 3 mm) were created in New Zealand white rabbits and untreated (group I), or treated with a bilayer collagen scaffold (group II) or BMP-4 with scaffold (group III) (n = 12/group). The repaired tissues were harvested for histology and mechanical testing after 6 or 12 weeks.Cartilage differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells was more apparent after BMP-4 treatment, as evidenced by higher expression of type II collagen and aggrecan genes. Also, BMP-4 induced higher aggrecan and fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 gene expression in chondrocytes, whereas BMP-7 had no effect. In the in vivo experiments, group III treated with BMP-4 protein had the largest amounts of cartilage tissue, which restored a greater surface area of the defect and achieved higher International Cartilage Repair Society scores. Moreover, Young's modulus, which indicates the mechanical properties of the repaired tissue, was markedly higher in group III than in groups I and II (p < 0.05), but lower than in normal tissue.BMP-4 is more potent than BMP-7 for cartilage differentiation. The delivery of BMP-4 protein in a bilayer collagen scaffold stimulates the formation of cartilage tissue.",0

However, chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation is a major obstacle for the application of hBMSCs in articular cartilage defect treatment. We have previously shown that microRNA-27b (miR-27b) inhibits hypertrophy of chondrocytes from rat knee cartilage. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-27b in chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation of hBMSCs. Methods Chondrogenic marker and microRNA expression in hBMSC chondrogenic pellets were evaluated using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. The hBMSCs were transfected with miR-27b before inducing differentiation. Gene and protein expression levels were analyzed using RT-qPCR and western blot. Coimmunoprecipitation was used to confirm interaction between CBFB and RUNX2. Luciferase reporter assays were used to demonstrate that CBFB is a miR-27b target. Chondrogenic differentiation was evaluated in hBMSCs treated with shRNA targeting CBFB . Chondrogenic hBMSC pellets overexpressing miR-27b were implanted into cartilage lesions in model rats; therapeutic effects were assessed based on histology and immunohistochemistry. Results The hBMSCs showed typical MSC differentiation potentials. During chondrogenic differentiation, collagen 2 and 10 ( COL2 and COL10 ), SOX9 , and RUNX2 expression was upregulated. Expression of miR-140, miR-143, and miR-181a increased over time, whereas miR-27b and miR-221 were downregulated. Cartilage derived from hBMSC and overexpressing miR-27b exhibited higher expression of COL2 and SOX9 , but lower expression of COL10 , RUNX2 , and CBFB than did the control cartilage. CBFB and RUNX2 formed a complex, and CBFB was identified as a novel miR-27b target. CBFB knockdown by shRNA during hBMSC chondrogenic differentiation led to significantly increased COL2 and SOX9 expression and decreased COL10 expression. Finally, miR-27b-overexpressing hBMSC chondrogenic pellets had better hyaline cartilage morphology and reduced expression of hypertrophic markers and tend to increase repair efficacy in vivo. Conclusion MiR-27b plays an important role in preventing hypertrophic chondrogenesis of hBMSCs by targeting CBFB and is essential for maintaining a hyaline cartilage state. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of hBMSC chondrocyte differentiation and will aid in the development of strategies for treating cartilage injury based on hBMSC transplantation.",0

In this study, a strategy was proposed to utilize type II collagen (Col-II) gels with autologous bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) embedded to repair full-thickness chondral defects. Its feasibility and efficacy were further assessed in a minipig model. An 8-mm full-thickness chondral defect was created on the femoral trochlea of two knees in Guizhou minipigs. One knee received Col-II gels with BMDCs implantation versus the untreated one as control. After 1, 3, and 6 months operation, the animals were sacrificed, and the repair outcomes of chondral defects were evaluated using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), macro- and microscopic observation, and histological analysis. The treatment group showed significantly better repair outcomes of chondral defects than that in the control group at each time point (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the image showed that the repaired tissue in the treatment group was more similar to the surrounding healthy cartilage tissue. Based on the hyaline-like tissue regenerated ability, this one-step strategy provides a promising therapeutic potential for clinical application.",0

Once injured, it cannot be repaired, typically leading to high risk for developing osteoarthritis. Thus, cell-based and/or tissue-engineered approaches have been investigated; however, no approach has yet achieved safety and regenerative repair capacity via a simple implantation procedure.To assess the safety and efficacy of using a scaffold-free tissue-engineered construct (TEC) derived from autologous synovial membrane mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for effective cartilage repair.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Five patients with symptomatic knee chondral lesions (1.5-3.0 cm2) on the medial femoral condyle, lateral femoral condyle, or femoral groove were included. Synovial MSCs were isolated from arthroscopic biopsy specimens and cultured to develop a TEC that matched the lesion size. The TECs were then implanted into chondral defects without fixation and assessed up to 24 months postoperatively. The primary outcome was the safety of the procedure. Secondary outcomes were self-assessed clinical scores, arthroscopy, tissue biopsy, and magnetic resonance image-based estimation of morphologic and compositional quality of the repair tissue.No adverse events were recorded, and self-assessed clinical scores for pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sports activity, and quality of life were significantly improved at 24 months after surgery. Secure defect filling was confirmed by second-look arthroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging in all cases. Histology of biopsy specimens indicated repair tissue approaching the composition and structure of hyaline cartilage.Autologous scaffold-free TEC derived from synovial MSCs may be used for regenerative cartilage repair via a sutureless and simple implantation procedure.

In vitro experiments have shown that the application of synthetic scaffolds is a promising alternative to existing therapeutic options. A sheep study was conducted to test the suitability of microporous pure β-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) ceramics as tissue engineering scaffolds for the repair of osteochondral defects. Cylindrical plugs of microporous β-TCP (diameter: 7mm; length: 25mm; porosity: 43.5±2.4%; pore diameter: ~5μm) with interconnecting pores were used. Scaffolds were seeded with autologous chondrocytes in vitro and cultured for 4weeks. A drill hole (diameter 7mm) was placed in both medial femoral condyles of sheep. For the left knee the defect was filled with a TCP plug and for the right knee the defect was left empty. After 6, 12, 26 and 52weeks, seven animals from each group were killed and studied. The samples were examined employing histological, histomorphometric and immunohistological methods as well as various imaging techniques (X-ray, microcomputer tomography and scanning electron microscopy). After explantation the cartilage defects were first assessed macroscopically. There were no signs of infection or inflammation. Histological grading scales were used for assessment of bony integration and cartilage repair. An increasing degradation (81% after 52weeks) of the ceramic with concomitant bone formation was observed. The original structure of cancellous bone was almost completely restored. After 26 and 52weeks, collagen II-positive hyaline cartilage was detected in several samples. New subchondral bone had formed. The formation of cartilage began at the outer edge and proceeded to the middle. According to the O'Driscoll score, values corresponding to healthy cartilage were not reached after 1year. Integration of the newly formed cartilage tissue into the surrounding native cartilage was found. The formation of biomechanical stable cartilage began at the edge and progressed towards the centre of the defect. After 1year this process was still not completed. Microporous β-TCP scaffolds seeded with chondrocytes are suitable for the treatment of osteochondral defects.",0

MATERIAL AND METHODS:Porous PLGA scaffolds were prepared in a bilayered manner to reflect the structure of chondral and subchondral bone. Bone defects, measuring 4 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness, were created in both knee joints in 18 healthy New Zealand white rabbits, aged between 120–180 days old. Rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: rabbits with bone defects implanted with bilayer PLGA scaffolds (PLGA group) (N=6); or with bilayer PLGA and autologous PRP (PLGA/PRP group) (N=6); and the untreated group (control group) (N=6). The gross morphology, histology, and immunohistochemistry for the expression of collagen type II and aggrecan were observed at 12 weeks after surgery and compared using a scoring system. Micro-computed tomography (CT) imaging and relative expression of specific genes were also assessed. RESULTS:The platelet concentrations in the PRP samples were found to be 4.9 times greater than that of whole blood samples. The total score on gross appearance and histology was greatest in the PLGA/PRP group, as was the expression of collagen II and aggrecan of the neo-tissue. Micro-CT imaging showed that more subchondral bone was formed in the PLGA/PRP group. CONCLUSIONS:Bilayer PLGA scaffolds loaded with autologous PRP improve the reconstruction of osteochondral defects in the rabbit model.",0

The challenge has been to develop techniques that are cost effective single-stage procedures with minimal surgical trauma that have undergone rigorous preclinical scrutiny and robust reproducible assessment of effectiveness. A biological repair requires the generation of a cellular and matrix composite with appropriate signalling for chondrogenic differentiation. Methods and results A technique was developed that allowed chondrogenic primary (uncultured) cells from bone marrow aspirate concentrate, combined with a composite hydrophilic and fibrillar matrix to be applied arthroscopically to a site of a chondral lesion. The construct was tested in vitro and in animal experiments before clinical trials. Clinical trials involved 60 patients in a prospective study. Symptomatic International Cartilage Repair Society grade 3 and 4a lesions were mapped and treated. Pre- and postoperative clinical assessments showed statistically significant improved outcomes; Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale (mean 52.8 to &gt; 76.4; P &lt; 0.05) International Knee Documentation Committee (mean 39 to &gt; 79 P &lt; 0.05) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (64.5 to &gt;89.2 P &lt; 0.05). Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging was evaluated morphologically (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue, average MOCART score 72) and qualitatively; the regenerate was comparable to native cartilage. Conclusions This technique is effective, affordable, requires no complex tools and delivers a single-stage treatment that is potentially accessible to any centre capable of performing arthroscopic surgery. Good clinical results were found to be sustained at five years of follow-up with a regenerate that appears hyaline like using multiple magnetic resonance measures.",0

There is a consensus regarding nonoperative management of asymptomatic OCDs of the talus. Surgery is often indicated in symptomatic cases and multiple techniques have been proposed, each with specific advantages and disadvantages. Acute OCDs are usually treated by excision particularly if the fragment is small, displaced, or comminuted. If the fragment is large with a cartilage surface intact, repair may be attempted, particularly with an anterolateral location. In chronic lesions, most authors consider nonoperative management as the standard first-line approach for nondisplaced lesions. Initial surgical treatment usually consists of debridement, curettage, or microfracture to obtain a stable bleeding base. Failed initial debridement is an indication for resurfacing, with osteoarticular cartilage transfer or mosaicplasty, autologous chondrocyte implantation, or similar techniques using cartilage fragments or scaffolds performed as initial options. Generally, osteochondral allograft transplantation is considered as a salvage procedure, or for large lesions with significant bone loss that cannot be treated successfully with other resurfacing techniques.",0

To overcome the disadvantages of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and to improve the outcomes of autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC), the latter technique is currently augmented with bone marrow concentrate injected under or seeded onto the scaffold. However, to date, only a little is known about histological outcomes of either the AMIC technique or AMIC associated with bone marrow concentrate. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of the repair tissue obtained from biopsies harvested during second-look arthroscopy after arthroscopic AMIC augmented with bone marrow concentrate. We analysed five second-look core biopsies harvested at 12 months follow-up. At the time of biopsy the surgeon reported the quality of the repair tissue using the standard ICRS Cartilage Repair Assessment (CRA). Every biopsy together with patient data was sent to our centre to undergo blind histological evaluation (ICRS II Visual Histological Assessment Scale) and data analysis. Five asymptomatic patients (mean age 43.4 years) had isolated lesions (mean size was 3.7 cm2) at the medial femoral condyle. All the implants appeared nearly normal (ICRS CRA) at arthroscopic evaluation and had a mean overall histological (ICRS II) of 59.8±14,5. Hyaline-like matrix was found in only one case, a mixture of hyaline/fibrocartilage was found in one case and fibrocartilage was found three cases. Our clinical and histological data suggest that this procedure achieved a nearly normal arthroscopic appearance and a satisfactory repair tissue, which was possibly still maturing at 12 months follow-up. Further studies are needed to understand the true potential of one-step procedures in the repair of focal chondral lesions in the knee.",0

The aim of this study is to obtain the reference values of CRP during the first month after an ACL reconstruction and to analyse the epidemiological and surgical parameters that affect these values. One hundred and twenty ACL reconstructions were included. A CRP determination was performed preoperatively and 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after surgery. CRP values under 5 mg/l were considered to be normal. One patient developed a septic arthritis in the second week postoperatively and was excluded. One hundred and seventeen patients [93 males and 24 females; mean age (standard deviation) 31.6 years (7.6)] underwent 119 ACL reconstructions with different techniques and grafts. Preoperative CRP (n = 119) was 1.80 mg/ml (2.6). Mean values at 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days were, respectively, 8.5 mg/ml (11.6), 10.5 mg/ml (17.0), 4.5 mg/ml (3.43), 4.4 mg/ml (7.59) and 3.4 mg/ml (3.03). Multivariate analysis showed that males had postoperative CRP levels 1.7 higher than females (p \textbackslashtextless 0.0001; 95 % CI 1.8-2.5); the patients operated by less experienced surgeons had levels 2.5 times higher than those operated by a highly experienced surgeons (p = 0.007; 95 % CI 1.2-3.4) and that if microfracture of a chondral lesion was associated, the levels increased 1.9 times (p = 0.021; 95 % CI 1.1-3.4). There are significant variations in CRP levels after ACL reconstruction in half of patients without infectious complications. Males, patients operated by less experienced surgeons and those with chondral lesions treated with microfracture had increased postoperative CRP levels. CRP values up to five times the normal limit are common in the month after an ACL reconstruction and are not necessarily associated with infection, especially in these groups.

Cartilage biopsies were taken from the non-load-bearing area of the lateral talus of the left tibiotarsal joint of eight healthy Haflinger horses. Tissue engineering cartilage transplants were generated by three-dimensional arrangement of autologous chondrocytes in biocompatible and resorbable polymer scaffolds. Full-thickness cartilage defects of 8 mm in diameter were created in the tubular bone condyle of the fetlock joint and cartilage grafts were fixed using an anchor system, while defects without grafting served as controls. After 6 and 12 months the repair tissue was evaluated histologically and showed formation of a cartilaginous tissue and good integration into the surrounding host tissue with firm bonding of the graft to the adjacent cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the content of glycosaminoglycans and hydroxyproline is comparable in repair tissue derived from treated and control defects. The use of three-dimensional autologous cartilage transplants based on resorbable polymer scaffolds ensures secure fixation, good integration of the graft into cartilage lesions, and is therefore suggested as a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of cartilage defects.",0

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the press-fit technique reconstructs the normal hyaline cartilage and provides acoustic stiffness equal to that of normal intact cartilage. <b>Methods:</b> In 36 rabbits an osteochondral plug, 6 mm in diameter, was removed from the right patellar groove and grafted into a recipient hole, 5 mm in diameter, in the left patellar groove. Specimens at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 52 weeks postoperatively were assessed by macroscopic and histologic observation and by use of an ultrasonic system. The ultrasonic acoustic stiffness, acoustic surface irregularity, and acoustic thickness of the implanted cartilage were examined and compared with normal intact cartilage. <b>Results:</b> The gross appearance of the implanted cartilage was glossy, maintained good surface smoothness, and survived well throughout the observation period. The cartilage recovered histologic features of hyaline cartilage. The acoustic stiffness decreased up to 12 weeks and then increased at 24 and 52 weeks after surgery. The acoustic stiffness at 8 or 12 weeks was significantly lower (acoustically softer) than that of control cartilage (<i>P</i> < .001). The acoustic stiffness at 52 weeks was equal to that of the control. The difference in acoustic surface irregularity was not significant. The acoustic thickness at 8 weeks was higher (acoustically thicker) than that of the control (<i>P</i> < .01). <b>Conclusions:</b> Although the reason acoustically soft cartilage in plugs becomes acoustically stiff and whether the histology of the implanted cartilage had recovered completely remain unclear, the acoustic stiffness recovered to normal control values by 52 weeks postoperatively. <b>Clinical Relevance:</b> Postoperative care for up to 12 weeks should be taken after autologous osteochondral transplantation.",0

Both the understanding of the etiology of FCDs and the surgical management of these chondral defects has exponentially grown in recent years. This is reflected by the number of surgical procedures performed for FCDs, which is now approximately 200,000 annually. This fact is also apparent in the wide variety of available surgical approaches to FCDs. Although simple arthroscopic debridement or microfracture are usually the first line of treatment for smaller lesions, chondral lesions that involve a larger area or depth require restorative procedures such as osteochondral allograft transplantation or other cell-based techniques. Given the prevalence of FCDs and the increased attention on treating these lesions, a comprehensive understanding of management from diagnosis to rehabilitation is imperative for the treating surgeon. This narrative review aims to describe current concepts in the treatment of large FCDs through providing an algorithmic approach to selecting interventions to address these lesions as well as the reported outcomes in the literature.",0

Due to limited capability for self-regeneration, cartilage repair remains a challenge for the present-day orthopedics. Currently, available therapeutic methods fail to provide satisfactory results. A search for other strategies that could regenerate a hyaline-like tissue with a durable effect and adequate mechanical properties is underway. Tissue engineering strategies comprise the use of an appropriately chosen scaffold in combination with seeding cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) provide an interesting new option in regenerative medicine with solid preclinical data and first promising clinical results. They act not only through direct cartilage formation, but also due to paracrine effects, such as releasing trophic factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and promoting angiogenesis. The MSC can be applied in an allogeneic setting without eliciting a host immune response. Out of the various available sources, MSC derived from Wharton's jelly of an umbilical cord seem to have many advantages over their counterparts. This article details a novel, single-staged, and minimally invasive technique for cartilage repair that involves dry arthroscopic implantation of scaffold-embedded allogenic mesenchymal stem cells isolated from umbilical cord Wharton's jelly.",0

However, low isolation efficiency of synMSCs limits their therapeutic application. Niche-preserving non-enzymatic isolation of synMSCs was firstly attempted by employing micro-organ culture system based on recapitulating tissue-specific homeostasis ex vivo. The isolated synMSCs retained superior long-term growth competency, proliferation and chondrogenic potential to bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs). It was noted that synMSCs demonstrated 9-fold increase in cartilaginous micro-tissue formation and 13-fold increase in sulfated proteoglycans deposition compared to BMSCs. For delivery of synMSCs, fibrous PLGA scaffolds were specifically designed for full-thickness osteochondral defects in rabbits. The scaffolds provided effective micro-environment for growth and host-integration of synMSCs. Combined delivery of synMSCs with bone morphogenetic proteins-7 (BMP-7) was designed to achieve synergistic therapeutic efficacy. BMP-7-loaded PLGA nanoparticles electrosprayed onto the scaffolds released BMP-7 over 2 weeks to conform with its aimed role in stimulating early stage endochondral ossification. Scaffold-supported combined administration of synMSCs with BMP-7 resulted in high proteoglycan and collagen type II induction and thick hyaline cartilage formation. Intra-articular co-delivery of synMSCs with BMP-7 via fibrous PLGA scaffolds may be a promising therapeutic modality for articular cartilage repair.",0

Purpose This study evaluates the use of polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds for the regeneration of articular cartilage in a rabbit model. Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Methods Five conditions were tested to attempt cartilage repair. To compare spontaneous healing (from subchondral plate bleeding) and healing due to tissue engineering, the experiment considered the use of osteochondral defects (to allow blood flow into the defect site) alone or filled with bare PCL scaffold and the use of PCL-chondrocytes constructs in chondral defects. For the latter condition, 1 series of PCL scaffolds was seeded in vitro with rabbit chondrocytes for 7 days and the cell/scaffold constructs were transplanted into rabbits’ articular defects, avoiding compromising the subchondral bone. Cell pellets and bare scaffolds were implanted as controls in a chondral defect. Results After 3 months with PCL scaffolds or cells/PCL constructs, defects were filled with white cartilaginous tissue; integration into the surrounding native cartilage was much better than control (cell pellet). The engineered constructs showed histologically good integration to the subchondral bone and surrounding cartilage with accumulation of extracellular matrix including type II collagen and glycosaminoglycan. The elastic modulus measured in the zone of the defect with the PCL/cells constructs was very similar to that of native cartilage, while that of the pellet-repaired cartilage was much smaller than native cartilage. Conclusion The results are quite promising with respect to the use of PCL scaffolds as aids for the regeneration of articular cartilage using tissue engineering techniques.",0

The purpose of this systematic review was to compare outcomes after combined MAT and cartilage repair/restoration with the outcomes of isolated MAT or cartilage repair/restoration.Multiple databases were searched with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for clinical outcome studies after combined MAT and cartilage repair or restoration.Six studies were identified for inclusion. In total 110 patients underwent combined MAT/cartilage repair or restoration (medial compartment in 66 and lateral compartment in 44). Patients underwent MAT and either autologous chondrocyte implantation (n = 73), osteochondral allograft (n = 20), osteochondral autograft transfer (n = 17), or microfracture (n = 3). Thirty-six patients underwent additional concurrent surgeries (high tibial or distal femoral osteotomy, cruciate or collateral ligament reconstruction, and hardware removal). All clinical outcomes were improved at final follow-up (mean, 36 months). In 4 of 6 studies, overall outcomes of combined surgery were equivalent to those of either procedure performed in isolation. In 2 studies outcomes of combined surgery were not as good as those of either procedure performed in isolation. Failure occurred in 12% of patients who underwent combined MAT and cartilage restoration, and they required revision surgery. Most failures (85%) of combined surgery were due to failure of the MAT (as opposed to the cartilage technique). One-half of all patients required at least 1 surgery after the index procedure before final follow-up.Clinical outcomes after combined MAT and cartilage repair/restoration are similar to those after either procedure in isolation. Despite low rates of complications and failures, there is a high rate of subsequent surgery after combined MAT and cartilage repair or restoration.Level IV, systematic review of Level IV studies.",0

Magnetic resonance (MR) tomography is an excellent noninvasive method for monitoring cartilage repair tissues throughout the postsurgical period. However, evaluating cartilage morphology after matrix-based autologous cartilage implantation (ACI) with MR imaging (MRI) still remains a challenge. In this study, we combined a high-resolution cartilage-sensitive fast-spin echo (FSE) sequence with intravenous application of a contrast agent for enhancing synovial fluid. Two independent musculoskeletal radiologists interpreted the pictures for the thickness, length and surface of the cartilage implants. A multivariate two-way analysis of variance with two repeated measures was performed and showed that evaluation of cartilage implant morphology was significantly improved after the application of gadodiamide on proton density FSE images. Contrast-enhanced MRI of articular cartilages is a promising technique in the postoperative follow-up of patients after ACI.",0

The inclusion criteria were animal and clinical studies published in English that used autologous BMAC to treat focal chondral defects of the knee. We excluded studies that evaluated nonconcentrated preparations of bone marrow aspirate or preparations that were culture expanded.A total of 23 studies were included: 10 studies performed in animal models and 13 human clinical studies. Animal studies showed inconsistent outcomes regarding the efficacy of BMAC for the treatment of chondral or osteochondral lesions, assessed by gross morphology, second-look arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, histology, immunohistochemistry, mechanical testing, and micro-tomography. Chondral defect filling was achieved with fibrocartilage or ""hyaline-like"" cartilage. Cells present in BMAC did not meet the criteria to be characterized as mesenchymal stem cells according to the International Society for Cell Therapy because freshly isolated cells failed to show tri-lineage differentiation. Overall, all clinical studies, independent of the study group or level of evidence, reported improved clinical outcomes and higher macroscopic, magnetic resonance imaging, and histology scores. Comparative trials favored BMAC over microfracture and reported equivalent outcomes between BMAC and matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation. However, clinical studies were scant and showed low scientific rigor, poor methodologic quality, and low levels of evidence on average.Although clinical success in short-term and midterm applications has been suggested for the application of BMAC for the restoration of cartilage defects in lesions of the knee, current study designs are generally of low scientific rigor. In addition, clinical applications of this technology in animal model investigations have shown inconsistent outcomes. Thus, clinicians should apply this technology cautiously.Level IV, systematic review of Level II, III, and IV evidence studies.",0

Salvage techniques are necessary when either nonoperative or typical operative treatments fail, or the OCD presents in an unsalvageable state. The purpose of this review is to describe the evaluation and management of failed OCDs.Recent FindingsThorough preoperative planning is essential to the treatment of failed OCDs. Radiographs and advanced imaging such as MRI and CT allow for a detailed assessment of subchondral bone and cartilage. Long-leg alignment radiographs are critical to assess for malalignment which may increase the contact forces on the affected condyle. Malalignment can be corrected with hemiepiphysiodesis or an osteotomy depending on the skeletal maturity of the patient. Osteochondral allografts and autologous chondrocyte implantation treat the defect in both bone and cartilage or solely cartilage and have good short to moderate term outcomes, particularly as compared to the inferior outcomes of microfracture of larger OCDs.SummaryOsteochondritis dissecans of the knee that fails to heal with initial operative measures can result in a large defect of bone and cartilage in the knee of adolescents. Treatment of the bone and cartilage defect can be accomplished with either osteochondral allograft transplantation or matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation can be performed with good outcomes. Assessment and correction of lower extremity malalignment is a critical component of treatment. Durable long-term solutions are necessary for the treatment of these difficult lesions.",0

Alginate served as a temporary supportive matrix component and was removed prior to transplantation. The defects were analyzed macroscopically, histologically, and electron microscopically, and evaluated with a semi-quantitative score system. Periosteal cell transplants showed a chondrogenic differentiation, which results in the development of embryonic-like cartilage tissue after 4 weeks and complete resurfacing of the patellar groove after 12 weeks. In the control groups, no repair was observed. Under the influence of TGF-beta1 we observed a reduction of the cartilage layer, whereas the osteochondral integration and the zonal architecture were improved. Periosteal cell-beads are stable cartilage transplants and have stiffness and elasticity enough for easy and sufficient transplant fixation. Further investigations are necessary to optimize the application of TGF-beta1 for cartilage repair.",0

Therefore it is timely to conduct a comprehensive review of the literature to assess and report on the current status of Level I and II evidence studies related to microfracture techniques.A literature search was carried out for Level I and II evidence studies on cartilage repair using the PubMed database. All the studies that dealt with microfracture techniques were selected.Fifteen studies that involved microfracture techniques met the inclusion criteria of this review article, with 6 long-term and 9 short-term studies. These studies compared the clinical outcomes of microfracture with those of other treatments such as autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral cylinder transfers. The majority of the studies reported poor clinical outcomes, whereas 2 studies reported the absence of any significant difference in the results. Small-sized lesions and younger patients showed good results in the short-term. However, osteoarthritis and treatment failures were observed at later postoperative periods of 5 to 10 years.The use of microfracture for the treatment of small lesions in patients with low postoperative demands was observed to result in good clinical outcomes at short-term follow-up.

Mechanical loading modulates cartilage during development, but it remains unclear how loads produced in the course of postoperative rehabilitation affect the formation of the new fibrocartilaginous tissue. Purpose: To assess the influence of different mechanical loading regimens, including dynamic compressive stress or rotational shear stress, on an in vitro model of microfracture repair based on fibrin gel scaffolds encapsulating connective tissue progenitor cells. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Cylindrical cores were made in bovine hyaline cartilage explants and filled with either (1) cartilage plug returned to original location (positive control), (2) fibrin gel (negative control), or (3) fibrin gel with encapsulated connective tissue progenitor cells (microfracture mimic). Constructs were then subjected to 1 of 3 loading regimens: (1) no loading (ie, unloaded), (2) dynamic compressive loading, or (3) rotational shear loading. On days 0, 7, 14, and 21, the integration strength between the outer chondral ring and the central insert was measured with an electroforce mechanical tester. The central core component, mimicking microfracture neotissue, was also analyzed for gene expression by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, glycosaminoglycan, and double-stranded DNA contents, and tissue morphology was analyzed histologically. Results: Integration strengths between the outer chondral ring and central neotissue of the cartilage plug and fibrin + cells groups significantly increased upon exposure to compressive loading compared with day 0 controls ( P = .007). Compressive loading upregulated expression of chondrogenesis-associated genes (SRY-related HGMG box-containing gene 9 [ SOX9], collagen type II α1 [ COL2A1], and increased ratio of COL2A1 to collagen type I α1 [ COL1A1], an indicator of more hyaline phenotype) in the neotissue of the fibrin + cells group compared with the unloaded group at day 21 ( SOX9, P = .0032; COL2A1, P &lt; .0001; COL2A1:COL1A1, P = .0308). Fibrin + cells constructs exposed to shear loading expressed higher levels of chondrogenic genes compared with the unloaded condition, but the levels were not as high as those for the compressive loading condition. Furthermore, catabolic markers ( MMP3 and ADAMTS 5) were significantly upregulated by shear loading ( P = .0234 and P &lt; .0001, respectively) at day 21 compared with day 0. Conclusion: Dynamic compressive loading enhanced neotissue chondrogenesis and maturation in a simulated in vitro model of microfracture, with generation of more hyaline-like cartilage and improved integration with the surrounding tissue. Clinical Relevance: Controlled loading after microfracture may be beneficial in promoting the formation of more hyaline-like cartilage repair tissue; however, the loading regimens applied in this in vitro model do not yet fully reproduce the complex loading patterns created during clinical rehabilitation. Further optimization of in vitro models of cartilage repair may ultimately inform rehabilitation protocols.",0

All treatments (autologous chondrocyte implantation [ACI], matrix-induced ACI [MACI], autologous osteochondral transplantation [AOT]) utilized in the management of patellar chondral lesions, with the exception of isolated particulated juvenile articular cartilage, demonstrated statistically significant improvements in functional outcome scores compared with preoperative measurements at a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Postoperative MRIs were obtained in 6 studies and found that regardless of treatment, moderate-to-complete infill of patellar cartilage lesions was seen in the majority of patients. While failure rates were low for the various treatment modalities, rates of reoperation were substantial, with up to 40% to 60% reoperation rate seen after ACI.Patients treated with ACI, MACI, and AOT all demonstrated statistically significant improvements in functional outcome scores with radiographic evidence of healing at minimum of 2-year follow-up.

Bone marrow was harvested from the posterior iliac crest in 11 New Zealand White rabbits. MSC were isolated and cultured in autologous serum for 28 days and transferred to a hyaluronan scaffold 24 h prior to implantation. A 4 mm diameter and 1.5 mm deep defect was created in the medial femoral condyle of both knees and the scaffold with MSC was implanted in one knee while an empty scaffold was implanted in the contra-lateral knee. After 24 weeks the rabbits were killed and histological sections were subjected to semiquantitative and quantitative evaluation by observers blinded regarding treatment modality. High degree of filling was obtained, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatments. However, there was a tendency for a better quality of repair in the MSC treated knees. No hypertrophy was observed by either method. MSC in a hyaluronan scaffold may be a promising treatment approach, but further studies are needed to determine the best combination of scaffold and cells.",0
226,https://openalex.org/W168582535,,Mechanical strength of trabecular bone at the knee.,"Interest in the biomechanical properties of trabecular bone has expanded in response to the problems related to total and partial joint replacement with the knee joint constituting a main focus of attention. This relatively recent development has left a number of fundamental problems unanswered, especially related to the machining, storage and testing of trabecular bone specimens. Nevertheless, these studies have contributed to the understanding of the mechanical function of trabecular bone. Regarding the role of trabecular bone at the knee joint, the following conclusions may be emphasized (conclusions drawn from the author's previous studies (I-X) are shown in italics): (1) Trabecular bone is almost exclusively responsible for the transmission of load at the proximal tibial epiphysis from the knee joint to the metaphysis. The peripheral shell surrounding the epiphysis is not composed of cortical bone and plays a negligible role in load transmission. (2) The compressive strength and stiffness of trabecular bone is primarily dependent upon the apparent density, trabecular architecture and the strength of the bone material. Direct and indirect sources suggest that the true material strength of trabecular bone is less than that of cortical bone. The epiphyseal trabecular architecture, featuring a marked polarity with alignment of primary trabeculae at right angles to the joint surface, is responsible for functional anisotropy which points to the axial compressive properties as the more important mechanical parameters. (3) Tensile and shear properties are of special relevance to mechanical loosening of implants. These properties may be derived from the apparent density, and a close empirical relation to the axial compressive strength and stiffness is suggested. (4) The foam-like structure of trabecular bone is the basis for the large energy absorptive capacity. (5) The pattern of axial compressive stiffness and strength at the normal proximal tibia differs little among individuals. Supporting the medial tibial plateau is a large high strength area with maximal strength centrally and slightly anteriorly, while laterally there is a restricted area of relatively high strength posteriorly with a lower maximal value than medially. Bone strength is significantly reduced within ten millimeters of the subchondral bone plate, and this reduction continues distally at the lateral condyle.

Previous studies promote the fabrication of grafts consisting of a viable cell-seeded hydrogel integrated atop a porous, bone-like metal. Advantages of the manufacturing process have led to the evaluation of porous titanium as the bone-like base material. Here, porous titanium was shown to support the growth of cartilage to produce native levels of Young's modulus, using a clinically relevant cell source. Mechanical and biochemical properties were similar or higher for the osteochondral constructs compared to chondral-only controls. Further investigation into the mechanical influence of the base on the composite material suggests that underlying pores may decrease interstitial fluid pressurization and applied strains, which may be overcome by alterations to the base structure. Future studies aim to optimize titanium-based tissue engineered osteochondral constructs to best match the structural architecture and strength of native grafts.The studies described in this manuscript follow up on previous studies from our lab pertaining to the fabrication of osteochondral grafts that consist of a bone-like porous metal and a chondrocyte-seeded hydrogel. Here, tissue engineered osteochondral grafts were cultured to native stiffness using adult chondrocytes, a clinically relevant cell source, and a porous titanium base, a material currently used in clinical implants. This porous titanium is manufactured via selective laser melting, offering the advantages of precise control over shape, pore size, and orientation. Additionally, this manuscript describes the mechanical influence of the porous base, which may have applicability to porous bases derived from other materials.",0

The arthroscopic treatment of intra-articular pathologies, such as femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and labral tears, when associated with those alterations, has been suggested to provide inferior outcomes to those in patients without subchondral changes. Yet, the direct treatment of subchondral pathology has been limited. Recently, a technique for insufflating bone substitute into the bone marrow lesions of the knee, Subchondroplasty (Zimmer Knee Creations, Exton, PA), has led to promising results. Subchondroplasty has raised attention as a possible minimally invasive procedure to treat cystic changes in the acetabulum in patients who are not yet candidates for hip replacement. We present the technique of acetabular Subchondroplasty, in which a bone substitute material is injected into subchondral acetabular cysts under fluoroscopic guidance. In this technique, hip arthroscopy is used in conjunction with fluoroscopic guidance to address intra-articular pathologies and assess for possible intra-articular extravasation of the injectable material.",0
230,https://openalex.org/W288540532,,In vivo cultivation of human articular chondrocytes in a nude mouse-based contained defect organ culture model.,"The nude mouse model is an established method to cultivate and investigate tissue engineered cartilage analogues under in vivo conditions. One limitation of this common approach is the lack of appropriate surrounding articular tissues. Thus the bonding capacity of cartilage repair tissue cannot be evaluated. Widely applied surgical techniques in cartilage repair such as conventional and three-dimensional autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) based on a collagen gel matrix cannot be included into nude mouse studies, since their application require a contained defect. The aim of this study is to apply an organ culture defect model for the in vivo cultivation of different cell-matrix-constructs. Cartilage defects were created on osteochondral specimens which had been harvested from 10 human knee joints during total knee replacement. Autologous chondrocytes were isolated from the cartilage samples and cultivated in monolayer until passage 2. On each osteochondral block defects were treated either by conventional ACI or a collagen gel seeded with autologous chondrocytes, including a defect left empty as a control. The samples were implanted into the subcutaneous pouches of nude mice and cultivated for six weeks. After retrieval, the specimens were examined histologically, immunohistochemically and by cell morphology quantification. In both, ACI and collagen gel based defect treatment, a repair tissue was formed, which filled the defect and bonded to the adjacent tissues. The repair tissue was immature with low production of collagen type II. In both groups redifferentiation of chondrocytes remained incomplete. Different appearances of interface zones between the repair tissue and the adjacent cartilage were found. The presented contained defect organ culture model offers the possibility to directly compare different types of clinically applied biologic cartilage repair techniques using human articular tissues in a nude mouse model.",0

Critical size osteochondral defects were created in knee joints of Newzealand White rabbits. Allogenic rabbit chondrocytes were encapsulated in hydrogels and gel or gel+cells were implanted in defects aseptically. The regenerated cartilage was analyzed after 12 weeks of implantation. The morphological scoring indicates that repair tissue was formed in all the animals by 12 weeks irrespective of whether they were sham, received gel, or gel with cells as implant. However the repair tissue formed in sham appeared fibrous and opaque, where as those that received gel had texture similar to the surrounding native cartilage and animals with gel+cells showed varied response. Histology staining, score distribution and immunostaining for collagen Type II showed animals that received gel alone as the implant had a mixture of hyaline and fibro cartilage. The animals with cell encapsulated gels had more fibrous cells with weak staining for collagen type II. There was no significant enhancement in the quality of regenerated cartilage in presence of encapsulated chondrocytes.",0

Osteotomy of the medial malleolus is not unusual but presents the risk of malunion or irritation by hardware. The aim of the study was to analyze data from the German Cartilage Society (Knorpelregister DGOU) to evaluate the influence of medial malleolar osteotomy on clinical results of M-BMS + I/III collagen scaffold.The ankle module of the Cartilage Register includes a total of 718 patients, while 45 patients met the inclusion criteria. Patients were treated with an M-BMS + I/III collagen scaffold of the medial talus, 30 without and 15 with an osteotomy of the medial malleolus. The follow-up evaluations included FAAM (Foot and Ankle Ability Measure), FAOS (Foot and Ankle Outcome Score), and VAS (visual analogue scale).Forty-five patients (22 male, 23 female) aged between 18 and 69 years (mean: 34 years) were included in this study. Between preoperative and 12 months postoperative, we noted a significant improvement in FAAM-ADL (Activity of Daily Living) (P = 0.004) as well as FAOS-Pain (P = 0.001), FAOS-Stiffness (P = 0.047), FAOS-ADL (P = 0.002), FAOS-Sport (P = 0.001), and FAOS Quality of Life (P = 0.009). There was no significant difference between patients who underwent an osteotomy or not.The results show a significant improvement in patients' outcome scores following a M-BMS + I/III collagen scaffold.

The only current clinical solutions include microfracture, osteochondral grafting, and autologous chondrocyte implantation. Cartilage tissue engineering based on biomimetic scaffolds has become an appealing strategy to repair cartilage defects. Here, a chondrogenic collagen-chondroitin sulfate scaffold is tested in an orthotopic Lapine in vivo model to understand the beneficial effects of the immunomodulatory biomaterial on the full chondral defect. Using a combination of noninvasive imaging techniques, histological and whole transcriptome analysis, the scaffolds are shown to enhance the formation of cartilaginous tissue and suppression of host cartilage degeneration, while also supporting tissue integration and increased tissue regeneration over a 12 weeks recovery period. The results presented suggest that biomimetic materials could be a clinical solution for cartilage tissue repair, due to their ability to modulate the immune environment in favor of regenerative processes and suppression of cartilage degeneration.",0

Patients undergoing OAT have been shown to have the greatest rate and quickest return to sport of any cartilage-restoration procedure. Disadvantages encountered with the OAT procedure include limited donor sources, small treatable lesion size, and donor-site morbidity. Here, we describe our preferred technique of open OAT with donor-site back-filling using precut fresh osteochondral allograft plugs and micronized extracellular cartilage augmentation. Advantages to this technique include single-stage transfer of living autologous osteochondral grafts allowing for early ambulation, predictable return to sport, enhanced long-term graft survival, and decreased donor-site morbidity secondary to fresh osteochondral allograft back-fill.",0

Current osteochondral repair grafts are limited in availability and often fail due to insufficient osseous support and integration. Thus, a need exists for an off-the-shelf osteochondral construct with the propensity to overcome these shortcomings. Herein, a scalable process was used to develop a multi-layered osteochondral graft with a subchondral bone (ScB) phase tailored to support bone healing and integration. Multiple ScB formulations and fabrication techniques were screened via degradation, bioactivity, and unconfined compression testing. An optimized ScB construct was selected and its cytotoxicity assessed. Additionally, a cartilage analog was secured to the optimized ScB construct via a calcified cartilage layer, and the resulting osteochondral construct was characterized via interfacial shear and dynamic mechanical testing. The optimized ScB construct did not significantly alter local pH during degradation, exhibited measurable bioactivity in vitro, and had significantly greater compressive mechanical strength compared to other constructs. The attachment strength of the cartilage analog was significantly greater by an increase in compressive dynamic mechanical properties. Furthermore, this ScB construct was found to be cytocompatible with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells. Taken together, this optimized ScB material forms the robust foundation of a novel, off-the-shelf osteochondral construct to be used in defect repair.The quality of life for millions of individuals worldwide is detrimentally affected by focal chondral or osteochondral defects. Current off-the-shelf biomaterial constructs often fail to repair these defects due to insufficient osseous support and integration. Herein, we used a scalable process to fabricate and optimize a novel boney construct. This optimized boney construct demonstrated biochemical, physical, and mechanical properties tailored to promote bone healing. Furthermore, a novel cartilage analog was successfully attached to the boney construct, forming a multi-layered osteochondral construct.",0

However, the routine use of MSCs is limited in part by their low numbers and the need for methods and procedures outside of the joint or surgical field. Purpose: To demonstrate feasibility of a technique in which minimally manipulated synovial MSCs can be mobilized during knee arthroscopy, thereby showing proof of concept for the future evaluation and clinical use of native joint resident MSCs in single-stage joint repair strategies. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Patients (n = 15) undergoing knee arthroscopy who were free from synovitis or active inflammation were selected. Three samples of irrigation fluid were collected from each patient at inception of the procedure, after an initial inspection of the joint, and after agitation of the synovium. MSC numbers were evaluated by colony forming unit–fibroblastic assay. The phenotype of synovial fluid resident and synovial-mobilized MSCs was determined by flow cytometry, and their functionality was determined by trilineage differentiation. Adhesion of culture-expanded mobilized MSCs to fibrin scaffolds was also evaluated to ascertain whether mobilized MSCs might concentrate at sites of bleeding. Results: Normal irrigation during arthroscopy depleted resident synovial fluid MSCs (4-fold decrease, n = 15). Numbers of MSCs mobilized through use of a purpose-made device were significantly higher (105-fold) than those mobilized through use of a cytology brush (median of 5763 and 54 colonies, respectively; P = .001; n = 15). The mobilized cellular fraction contained viable MSCs with proliferative potential and trilineage differentiation capacity for bone, cartilage, and fat lineages, and cultured daughter cells exhibited the standard MSC phenotype. Following culture, mobilized synovial MSCs also adhered to various fibrin scaffolds in vitro. The technique was simple and convenient to use and was not associated with any complications. Conclusion: Numbers of functional MSCs can be greatly increased during arthroscopy through use of this technique to mobilize cells from the synovium. Clinical Relevance: This study highlights a novel, single-stage technique to increase joint-specific, synovial-derived MSCs and thereby increase the repair potential of the joint. This technique can be undertaken during many arthroscopic procedures, and it supports the principle of integrating mobilized MSCs into microfracture sites and sites of bleeding or targeted repair through use of fibrin-based and other scaffolds.",0

The information gained, that is, quality and quantity by magnetic resonance imaging and/or morphology (macro and micro), will allow the surgeon a choice as these techniques should certainly be part of a cartilage surgeon's armamentarium.

The MACI implant also has inherent advantages including surgical implantation via arthroscopy or miniarthrotomy, the elimination of periosteal harvest, and the use of tissue adhesive in lieu of sutures. This study evaluated the efficacy of the MACI implant in an equine full-thickness cartilage defect model at 1 year.Autologous chondrocytes were seeded onto a collagen type-I/III membrane and implanted into one of two 15-mm defects in the femoral trochlear ridge of 24 horses. Control defects either were implanted with cell-free collagen type-I/III membrane (12 horses) or were left ungrafted as empty defects (12 horses). An additional 3 horses had both 15-mm defects remain empty as nonimplanted joints. The repair was scored by second-look arthroscopy (12 weeks), and necropsy examination (53 weeks). Healing was assessed by arthroscopic scoring, gross assessment, histology and immunohistology, cartilage matrix component assay, and gene expression determination. Toxicity was examined by prostaglandin E2 formation in joint fluid, and lymph node morphology combined with histologic screening of organs.MACI-implanted defects had improved gross healing and composite histologic scores, as well as increases in chondrocyte predominance, toluidine blue-stained matrix, and collagen type-II content compared with scaffold-only implanted or empty defects. There was minimal evidence of reaction to the implant in the synovial membrane (minor perivascular cuffing), subchondral bone, or cartilage. There were no adverse clinical effects, signs of organ toxicity, or evidence of chondrocytes or collagen type-I/III membrane in draining lymph nodes.The MACI implant appeared to improve cartilage healing in a critical-sized defect in the equine model compared with collagen matrix alone.These results indicate that the MACI implant is quick to insert, provides chondrocyte security in the defect, and improves cartilage healing compared with ACI.",0

Numerous scaffold materials exist and the optimal scaffold needs to be identified. We have tried to assess the possibilities for cartilage repair by the use of two different scaffold techniques; autologous chondrocytes in a fibrin hydrogel and a novel MPEG-PLGA scaffold, where autologous chondrocytes are immobilized within the MPEG-PLGA scaffold by a fibrin hydrogel. Twenty adult goats were used for the study. A 6 mm circular full-thickness cartilage defect was created in both medial femoral condyles. The defects were randomized to the following four treatment groups. (1) Empty defect (control). (2) Subchondral drilling (control). (3) Fibrin hydrogel with autologous chondrocytes. (4) Fibrin hydrogel/chondrocyte solution in a MPEG-PLGA porous scaffold. Animals were followed for 4 month. Eight defects in each treatment group completed the study. ICRS macroscopic scoring (0-12). Indentation test was performed to assess stiffness of repair tissue. Histological analyses was performed using O'Driscoll and Pineda cartilage scores as well as percentage tissue filling of the defects. The MPEG-PLGA/chondrocytes scaffold was the superior treatment modality based on the macroscopic surface score, histological scores and defect filling. The mechanical test demonstrated no difference between treatment groups. The MPEG-PLGA/chondrocyte composite demonstrated significantly better cartilage repair response than empty defects, osteochondral drilling and fibrin hydrogel with chondrocytes. The novel MPEG-PLGA scaffold in combination with chondrocytes need further studies with respect to longer follow-up times.",0

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different species of collagen-engineered neocartilage for the treatment of critical-size defects in the articular joint in a rabbit model. Type II and I collagen obtained from rabbits and rats was mixed to form a scaffold. The type II/I collagen scaffold was then mixed with rabbit chondrocytes to biofabricate neocartilage constructs using a rotating cell culture system [three-dimensional (3D)-bioreactor]. The rabbit chondrocytes were mixed with rabbit collagen scaffold and rat collagen scaffold to form neoRBT (neo-rabbit cartilage) and neoRAT (neo-rat cartilage) constructs, respectively. The neocartilage matrix constructs were implanted into surgically created defects in rabbit knee chondyles, and histological examinations were performed after 2 and 3 months. Cartilage-like lacunae formation surrounding the chondrocytes was noted in the cell cultures. After 3 months, both the neoRBT and neoRAT groups showed cartilage-like repair tissue covering the 5-mm circular, 4-mm-deep defects that were created in the rabbit condyle and filled with neocartilage plugs. Reparative chondrocytes were aligned as apparent clusters in both the neoRAT and neoRBT groups. Both neoRBT and neoRAT cartilage repair demonstrated integration with healthy adjacent tissue; however, more integration was obtained using the neoRAT cartilage.

However, the fate of the MSCs after intra-articular injection and their role in cartilage regeneration is not clear. To address these questions, this study investigated (1) homing of labeled human adipose tissue derived integrin α10β1-selected MSCs (integrin α10-MSCs) to a cartilage defect in a rabbit model and (2) the ability of the integrin α10-MSCs to differentiate to chondrocytes and to produce cartilage matrix molecules in vivo.Integrin α10-MSCs were labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) co-conjugated with Rhodamine B to allow visualization by both MRI and fluorescence microscopy. A cartilage defect was created in the articular cartilage of the intertrochlear groove of the femur of rabbits. Seven days post-surgery, labeled integrin α10-MSCs or vehicle were injected into the joint. Migration and distribution of the SPION-labeled integrin α10-MSCs was evaluated by high-field 9.4 T MRI up to 10 days after injection. Tissue sections from the repair tissue in the defects were examined by fluorescence microscopy.In vitro characterization of the labeled integrin α10-MSCs demonstrated maintained viability, proliferation rate and trilineage differentiation capacity compared to unlabeled MSCs. In vivo MRI analysis detected the labeled integrin α10-MSCs in the cartilage defects at all time points from 12 h after injection until day 10 with a peak concentration between day 1 and 4 after injection. The labeled MSCs were also detected lining the synovial membrane at the early time points. Fluorescence analysis confirmed the presence of the labeled integrin α10-MSCs in all layers of the cartilage repair tissue and showed co-localization between the labeled cells and the specific cartilage molecules aggrecan and collagen type II indicating in vivo differentiation of the MSCs to chondrocyte-like cells. No adverse effects of the α10-MSC treatment were detected during the study period.Our results demonstrated migration and homing of human integrin α10β1-selected MSCs to cartilage defects in the rabbit knee after intra-articular administration as well as chondrogenic differentiation of the MSCs in the regenerated cartilage tissue.",0

Because it is impossible to include observations on all the published articles in one review, our attempt is to highlight Asian progress in this area during recent years (2005 to the present), reviewing research development and clinical studies. In the former, our discussion of in vitro studies focuses on (1) potential sources of stem cells--such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from marrow, cord blood, synovium, and mobilized peripheral blood--which are capable of enhancing cartilage repair and (2) the use of growth factors and scaffolds with and without cells. Our discussion of animal studies attempts to summarize activities in evaluating surgical procedures and determining the route of cell administration, as well as studies on matrices and scaffolds. It ranges from the use of small animals such as rats and rabbits to larger animals like pigs and dogs. The local adherent technique, enhancement of microfracture with poly(l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) scaffold, adenovirus-mediated bone morphogenic protein (BMP) genes, and MSCs--whether they are magnetically labeled, suspended in hyaluronic acid, or immobilized with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)--have all been able to engineer a repair of the osteochondral defect. Although published Asian reports of clinical studies on cartilage repair are few, the findings of relevant trials are summarized in our discussion of these investigations. There has been a long history of use of laboratory-derived MSCs for cartilage repair. Recent progress has suggested the potential utility of cord blood and mobilized peripheral blood in this area, as well as more injectable bone marrow (BM)-derived stem cells.

Large osteochondral defect, which consists of a severe depression fracture and a large cartilage defect, need to be treated due to deformation of the articular surface as it can impact the clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. Although autologous chondrocyte implantation is one of the useful options in such cases, it can be questioned whether the reconstruction of the ACL and osteochondral defect should be performed in one procedure alone. Case presentation We report a case of a 38-year-old male with a deep depression fracture extending to the edge of the lateral femoral condyle associated with ACL injury after twisting his right knee while skiing. The patient was successfully treated with tissue-engineered cartilage transplantation covered by the periosteum with an iliac bone graft combined with anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction. Histopathological examination of the transplanted cartilage taken at second-look arthroscopy showed a cartilage-like tissue in the middle to deep zone in which the extracellular matrix was largely stained with Safranin O. The patient was able to return to his previous level of skiing activity without any experience of knee pain. Magnetic resonance imaging at 4 years after surgery showed that the graft integrated to the border zone and subchondral bone. The operated knee showed negative Lachman test and had a full range of motion. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first report of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with tissue-engineered cartilage transplantation and an iliac bone graft to restore the lateral edge of the femoral condyle.",0

Although all studies reported improvements in patient outcome measures, this was not necessarily correlated with magnetic resonance imaging findings. Although there were many additional procedures performed, when AMIC was performed in isolation, the results tended to peak at 24 mo before declining.Although short-term studies suggest improved patient reported outcomes with a variety of scaffolds, surgical techniques and rehabilitation regimes, the literature remains equivocal on whether the defect size and location, and patient factors affect the outcome. Patient benefit appears to be maintained in the short-to-medium term but more high level studies with extensive and robust validated outcome measures should be conducted to evaluate the medium- and long-term effect of the AMIC procedure.",0

Photopolymerizable cartilage tissue engineering approaches appear promising; however, fundamentally, forming a stable interface between the subchondral bone and tissue engineered cartilage components remains a major challenge. We investigated the utility of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles to promote controlled bone-growth across the bone-cartilage interface in an in vitro engineered tissue model system using bone marrow derived stem cells. Samples incorporated with HA demonstrated significantly higher interfacial shear strength (at the junction between engineered cartilage and engineered bone) compared with the constructs without HA (p < 0.05), after 28 days of culture. Interestingly, this increased interfacial shear strength due to the presence of HA was observed as early as 7 days and appeared to have sustained itself for an additional three weeks without interacting with strength increases attributable to subsequent secretion of engineered tissue matrix. Histological evidence showed that there was ∼7.5% bone in-growth into the cartilage region from the bone side. The mechanism of enhanced engineered cartilage to bone integration with HA incorporation appeared to be facilitated by the deposition of calcium phosphate in the transition zone. These findings indicate that controlled bone in-growth using HA incorporation permits more stable anchorage of the injectable hydrogel-based engineered cartilage construct via augmented integration between bone and cartilage.",0

Accordingly, the restoration of articular surface integrity is of major importance, especially in young adults where, in lesions left untreated or following simple fragment excision, early osteoarthritis can be anticipated. Therefore, the treatment algorithm in unstable knee OCD of the young adult foresees surgical options to restore the articular surface. Several procedures have been proposed, including refixation of the detached fragment bone marrow stimulation, osteochondral autograft implantation, fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation, and cell-based or cell-free regenerative techniques. The aim of this review was to summarize the evidence for these surgical strategies, reporting their results and limitations. The overall evidence documents positive results for each of the assorted surgical procedures applied to treat unstable OCD, thus indicating support for their selected use to treat osteochondral defects paying particular attention to their specific indications for the lesion characteristics. The fixation of a good quality fragment should be pursued as a first option, while unfixable small lesions may benefit from autografts. For large lesions, available cell-based or cell-free osteochondral scaffold are a feasible solution but with limitation in terms of regenerated tissue quality. In this light, fresh allografts may offer articular surface restoration with viable physiologic osteochondral tissue providing a predictably successful outcome, and therefore they may currently represent the most suitable option to treat unstable irreparable OCD lesion in young adults.",0

Major reconstructions are performed with osteosynthesized allografts and fresh allografts for cartilage.The main question to be answered is: what do we know about metaphyseal and epiphyseal cancellous bone healing, contact healing of the subchondral bone and its influence on cartilage healing? Can we achieve healing of all four compartments in contact?The purpose is to systematically investigate through animal testing the healing processes of metaphyseal and epiphyseal bone, including the subchondral bone and the healing of cartilage of press-fit-inserted grafts, considering nondemineralized high-resolution histology.Primary cancellous-bone healing of osteosynthesized hemi-osteotomies was studied in 13 canine tibial heads, the contact healing was investigated in 7 dogs and 18 giant-rabbits comparing contact-healing of press-fit-inserted autologs cylindrical grafts with empty defects applying the wet-grinding diamond-technology. Bench-experiments on the epiphyseal bones of swine including pullout-tests of cylindrical grafts formed the basis for validation of that press-fit diamond technology.Primary metaphyseal and epiphyseal contact healing, including hyaline cartilage, was found in all compartments of the meta-and epiphysis in the precisely performed experiments. The press-fit principle, which employs cylindrical grafts and diamond instrumentation featuring a difference of 15/100 mm between graft and recipient bed, achieved high loads between 73.48 and 178.95 N (mean value 118.16 and standard deviation 32.79) in the pullout tests.Autologous press-fit grafting with alignment of the bony baseplate using wet-grinding precision has attained promising histo-morphological results.",0

Most of these use scaffolds to achieve sufficient thickness. However, considering the potential influence of scaffolds on the surrounding microenvironment, as well as immunological issues, it is desirable to develop a scaffold-free technique. In this study, we developed a novel technique, a scaffold-free autologous construct derived from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), and successfully use this technique to regenerate cartilage and subchondral bone to repair an osteochondral defect in rabbit knees.BM-MSCs were isolated from bone marrow liquid aspirated from the iliac crest of rabbits. After expansion in culture dishes and re-suspension in 96-well plates, the cells spontaneously aggregated into a spheroid-like structure. The spheroids were loaded into a tube-shaped Teflon mold with a 5-mm height and maintained under air-liquid interface conditions. These loaded spheroids fused with each other, resulting in a cylinder-shaped construct made of fused cells that conformed to the inner shape of the mold. The construct was implanted into an osteochondral defect in rabbit knees and histologically analyzed 24 and 52 weeks after implantation using Wakitani's scoring system.Both bone and cartilage were regenerated, maintaining a constant thickness of cartilage. The mean histological score was 10 ± 1.7 in the 24-week group and 9.7 ± 0.6 in the 52-week group. There was no significant difference between the 24- and 52-week groups in either parameter of the score, indicating that no deterioration of the repaired tissue occurred during the intervening period.Using our novel technique, which employs a three-dimensional scaffold-free autologous construct derived from BM-MSCs, we successfully achieved simultaneous regeneration of bone and cartilage for up to 1 year in vivo. This method has potential for clinical use as a safe and effective method for repairing bone and cartilage defects.",0

An implant was constructed by dispersing the chondrocytes in a acid soluble type I collagen gel(5 x 10(6) cells/ml, final cell concentration). A full-thickness defect 3 mm x 5 mm was created in the trochlear groove of femur in 36 rabbits. A piece of cotton soaked in 0.5% trypsin was laid into the defect for 5 minutes, then the defect was filled with MSC/collagen gel implant on one side (n = 36), filled with a plain collagen gel on the other side (n = 18), and left empty as controls on the other side (n = 18). The animals were sacrificed at 4, 8, 12, 24, 32, and 48 weeks. The repaired tissue was examined and evaluated with Pineda grading scale.In MSCs group, the implanted cells resembled well differentiated chondrocytes and were surrounded by metachromatic matrix and the reparative tissue resembled hyaline cartilage after 4 weeks; bone was formed at the base of the defects, the thickness of new cartilage was larger than tht of normal one after 8 weeks; the thickness was reduced proximally, approximating to that of normal cartilage, and chondrocyte columns was formed and subchondral bone and tidemark reappeared after 12 weeks; the thickness of the new tissue was about 55% of the normal tissue, with smooth surface and there were hypertrophic chondrocytes near the tidemark after 24 weeks; no hypertrophic chondrocytes were observed, indicating cessation of endochondral ossification after 32 weeks; the tissue architecture was the same as that at 32 weeks, hyaline-like cartilage persisting, with subchondral bone and tidemark in continuity after 48 weeks. The four layer cell orientation was not as clear as that of normal cartilage. The defects were partially filled with fibrous tissue in controls. At 32 weeks, erosive cartilage, naked subchondral bone and proliferative synovial membrane indicated the presence of osteoarthrosis. There were no statistical difference according to Pineda tissue scales in the specimens from the MSCs group between 24, 32, and 48 weeks, but there was significant difference between 4 weeks and 24, 32 and 48 weeks (P < 0.05). The joint function recovered after 2 weeks in MSCs group, while it deteriorated progressively in controls.MSCs derived from chondrocytes improve repair of large full-thickness defect in articular cartilage. The reparative hyaline-like cartilage is stable differentiation after 24 weeks, maintains good joint function after 48 weeks.",0

The pluripotency status of each induced PSC line was validated by comparison with human embryonic stem cells (ESCs).We found that OA patient-derived human synovial cells had human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like characteristics, as indicated by the expression of specific markers, including CD14-, CD19-, CD34-, CD45-, CD44+, CD51+, CD90+, CD105+, and CD147+. Microarray analysis of human MSCs and human synovial cells further determined their unique and overlapping gene expression patterns. The pluripotency of established human induced PSCs was confirmed by their human ESC-like morphology, expression of pluripotency markers, gene expression profiles, epigenetic status, normal karyotype, and in vitro and in vivo differentiation potential. The potential of human induced PSCs to differentiate into distinct mesenchymal cell lineages, such as osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes, was further confirmed by positive expression of markers for respective cell types and positive staining with alizarin red S (osteoblasts), oil red O (adipocytes), or Alcian blue (chondrocytes). Functional chondrocyte differentiation of induced PSCs in pellet culture and 3-dimensional polycaprolactone scaffold culture was assessed by chondrocyte self-assembly and histology.Our findings indicate that patient-derived synovial cells are an attractive source of MSCs as well as induced PSCs and have the potential to advance cartilage tissue engineering and cell-based models of cartilage defects.",0

In the last years many cell-based treatments have been proposed, in order to obtain good regeneration of cartilage defects. The Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis technique (AMIC(®)) combines the micro-fracture procedure with the use of a specific biological membrane. The phenotypic feature of bone marrow cell population, harvested from iliac crest and knee subchondral bone of patients treated with the AMIC(®) technique, enhanced by autologous concentrated bone marrow, was analysed to evaluate potential variations of the cell population. Samples of eleven patients, with isolated chondral lesions grade III or IV were treated with the AMIC(®) technique, enhanced by the use of autologous concentrated bone marrow. A small fraction of bone marrow samples, both from iliac crest and from the created micro-fractures, was analysed by FACS analysis and then cultured to verify their proliferative and differentiation potential. An average of 0.04% of concentrated bone marrow cells harvested from the iliac crest, presented mesenchymal stem cell phenotype (CD34(-)/CD45(low)/CD271(high)), whereas just 0.02% of these cells were identified from the samples harvested during the creation of micro-fractures at the knee. After two passages in culture, cells expressed a peculiar profile for MSC. Only MSC from bone marrow could be long-term propagated and were able to efficiently differentiate in the cultures.

On the other side, OC lesions themselves, getting worse over time, can lead to OA, indicating that chondral and OC defects represent a risk factor for the onset of the pathology. Many animal models have been set up for years for the study of OC regeneration, being successfully employed to test different treatment strategies, from biomaterials and cells to physical and biological adjuvant therapies. These studies rely on a plethora of post-explant investigations ranging from histological and histomorphometric analyses to biomechanical ones. The present review aims to analyze the methods employed for the evaluation of OC treatments in each animal model by screening literature data within the last 10 years. According to the selected research criteria performed in two databases, 60 works were included. Data revealed that lapine (50% of studies) and ovine (23% of studies) models are predominant, and knee joints are the most used anatomical locations for creating OC defects. Analyses are mostly conducted on paraffin-embedded samples in order to perform histological/histomorphometric analyses by applying semiquantitative scoring systems and on fresh samples in order to perform biomechanical investigations by indentation tests on articular cartilage. Instead, a great heterogeneity is pointed out in terms of OC defect dimensions and animal’s age. The choice of experimental times is generally adequate for the animal models adopted, although few studies adopt very long experimental times. Improvements in data reporting and in standardization of protocols would be desirable for a better comparison of results and for ethical reasons related to appropriate and successful animal experimentation.",0

A Systematic Review of Preclinical and Clinical Evidence,"Regenerative scaffold-based procedures are emerging as a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral lesions. In general, we can summarize most of the recent developments to reach clinical application into 2 major trends: the use of different cell sources or the application of biomaterials as a cell-free approach. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze both preclinical and clinical studies on these new trends to understand how the available evidence supports the use of cell sources or justifies the cell-free approach for the scaffold-based treatment of cartilage lesions.The research was performed using the PubMed database by looking at studies published in the English language referring to chondral or osteochondral defect repair with scaffold-based procedures until the end of 2013. The following strings were used: (""cartilage""[MeSH] AND ""tissue scaffolds""[MeSH]).The search showed an increasing number of published articles each year for both scaffold-based approaches, identifying a total of 305 articles. Among clinical trials, 116 used cell-based scaffold treatments and 11 used scaffolds alone. In the preclinical setting, a scaffold/cell combination was the most used treatment approach (133 v 45 articles), with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) being the favorite cell type. Bone marrow was the most used cell source, but other sources are gaining interest. Among articles comparing scaffolds with or without cells, the majority reported superior results for cells (71 of 89 articles). In the clinical setting, most of the articles analyzed chondrocyte-based scaffolds, with only 7 studies using MSCs; all cells were from bone marrow. Despite the lower number of articles, cell-free scaffolds are gaining popularity, with a recent increase in published studies showing promising results.This systematic review underlined the difficulties in understanding the real need for cells to increase the scaffold-based cartilage healing potential because of the heterogeneity of products used as well as the design of the published studies. Scaffold and cell combinations were the most investigated option in the preclinical setting, showing generally superior results, but in the clinical setting, both strategies remain used. In particular, although chondrocytes are the most commonly used cell type, research showed increasing interest in the potential of MSCs for cartilage regeneration. However, the difficulties in managing cell cultures, together with the development of a new generation of materials able to exploit the intrinsic tissue regeneration ability, justifies the clinical use of cell-free scaffolds, with increasing literature and promising preliminary results.Level IV, systematic review of Level I to IV studies.",0

However, the inability to target MSCs in tissues of interest with high efficiency and engraftment has become a significant barrier for MSC-based therapies. The mobilization and transfer of MSCs to defective/damaged sites in tissues or organs in vivo with high efficacy and efficiency has been a major concern. In the present study, we identified a peptide sequence (E7) with seven amino acids through phage display technology, which has a high specific affinity to bone marrow-derived MSCs. Subsequent analysis suggested that the peptide could efﬁciently interact speciﬁcally with MSCs without any species specificity. Thereafter, E7 was covalently conjugated onto polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun meshes to construct an “MSC-homing device” for the recruitment of MSCs both in vitro and in vivo. The E7-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes were implanted into a cartilage defect site of rat knee joints, combined with a microfracture procedure to mobilize the endogenous MSCs. After 7 d of implantation, immunofluorescence staining showed that the cells grown into the E7-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes yielded a high positive rate for specific MSC surface markers (CD44, CD90 , and CD105) compared with those in arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes (63.67% vs. 3.03%; 59.37% vs. 2.98%; and 61.45% vs. 3.82%, respectively). Furthermore, the percentage of CD68 positive cells in the E7-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes was much lower than that in the RGD-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes (5.57% vs. 53.43%). This result indicates that E7-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes absorb much less inflammatory cells in vivo than RGD-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes. The results of the present study suggest that the identified E7 peptide sequence has a high specific affinity to MSCs. Covalently conjugating this peptide on the synthetic PCL mesh significantly enhanced the MSC recruitment of PCL in vivo. This method provides a wide range of potential applications in TE.",0

Osteochondral autograft transfer mosaicplasty is a method which has satisfactory outcomes among the treatment preferences of cartilage defects. In spite of the favorable clinical results there are some pitfalls of mosaicplasty treatment especially in cases of large defects. One of the major problems of the classical OAT mosaicplasty is the gap spaces between the plugs. The objective of the present study is to report the early clinical and radiological outcomes and to evaluate the clinical application of a new hexagonal osteochondral graft system (HOGS) with the hypothesis of improvement of the OAT mosaicplasty method with the use of hexagonally shaped plugs. The study has intended to answer two questions. (1) Does mosaicplasty with the new HOGS has favorable early clinical outcomes? (2) Is it possible to arrange the osteochondral autografts without leaving gap spaces by using hexagonal pattern in OAT mosaicplasty?We designed a retrospective study to report analysis of early outcomes of the initial case series of OAT mosaicplasty by using a new HOGS. Six male individuals with the diagnosis of osteochondral defect and treated with HOGS and reached sixth month follow-up formed the basis of the study. The clinical status of the patients were evaluated with IKDC score. The radiological evaluations were carried out with direct X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. The mosaicplasty procedures were carried out via standard surgical method of classical OAT mosaicplasty by using the HOGS following a diagnostic arthroscopy in the same session. The inclusion criteria was a full thickness osteochondral lesion of femoral condyle between 1.5 and 6 cm(2) and completion of 6 month follow-ups. The patients having deformities around the knee or major ligament lesions were excluded. MOCART scoring system was used for the evaluation of follow-up MRI findings. The clinical status of the patients were evaluated with IKDC scores.The mean age of the patients was 40.8 (±5.2) years and the mean duration of the symptoms on presentation was 16 (±4.3) months. On the initial MRI studies mean defect area was measured 3.7 cm(2) (±0.9) which was compatible with arthroscopic findings. During the surgical procedures it was possible to fill the defect area completely. The mean number of plugs in this series was 4.8 (±1.1). We did not faced with insufficient donor reserve problem in any of the cases. On the sixth month follow-up physical examination there was no limitation of the knee joint range of motion in the cases. All patients were able to bear weight on to their operated extremities without pain. The mean postoperative IKDC score improvement was 70.2 (±3.5) which shows significant improvement compared to preoperative scores. On the control MRI studies the bone integration of the hexagonal plugs were complete the cartilage continuity of the articular surfaces were intact and the grafts were well incorporated in all cases. The mean MOCART score on the 6th month MRI studies was 65.8 (±4.1).The early outcomes of OAT mosaicplasty with HOGS are comparable to studies on the classical mosaicplasty. According to our observations in this study we can say that the gap space left between the cylindrical plugs can be solved by using hexagonal prism shaped plugs.,0

The purpose of this study was to elucidate if mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) injected in the joints of mice with arthritis are therapeutic, reducing joint swelling and cartilage destruction.Murine mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs) were isolated from bone marrow of C57Bl/6 mice and expanded in culture. Cells were tested for immunophenotype and their ability to form colonies and to differentiate into chondrocytes, osteocytes and adipocytes. Antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) was induced by intra-articular injection of methylated bovine serum albumin into the knee joints of preimmunized C57Bl/6 mice. After one day, when peak swelling occurs, 500,000 mMSCs labelled with red fluorescent cell tracker CM-DiI were injected intra-articularly in the right knee joint. Left knee joints were treated as controls by receiving PBS injections. Differences between groups were calculated by Mann Whitney U test or unpaired t tests using GraphPad Prism software version 5.Knee joint diameter (swelling) was measured as a clinical indication of joint inflammation and this parameter was significantly less in MSC-treated mice compared to control-treated animals 48 hours after arthritis induction. This difference continued for ~7 days. CM-DiI-labelled MSCs were clearly visualised in the lining and sublining layers of synovium, in the region of the patella and femoral and tibial surfaces. By day 3, parameters indicative of disease severity, including cartilage depletion, inflammatory exudate and arthritic index were shown to be significantly reduced in MSC-treated animals. This difference continued for 7 days and was further confirmed by histological analysis. The serum concentration of tumour necrosis factor α was significantly decreased following MSC administration.Our results reveal that MSCs injected in the joints of mice with AIA are therapeutic, reducing inflammation, joint swelling and cartilage destruction. These cells also integrate into the synovium in AIA.",0

Individual study quality was assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies scale. Studies were published between 2005 and 2019. <h3>Results</h3> Eighteen studies consisting of 446 elbow OCD lesions treated with OAT surgery were included. There was a single OCA study eligible for inclusion. Patient ages ranged from 10 to 45 years. Of the OAT studies, 4 used autologous costal grafts whereas the remainder used autografts from the knee. Outcome measures were heterogeneously reported. A significant improvement in Timmerman-Andrews scores from preoperatively to postoperatively was reported in 9 of 10 studies. Return-to-play rates to the preinjury level of competitive play ranged from 62% to 100% across 16 studies. Significant improvement in motion, most often extension, was noted in most studies. Reported complication, reoperation, and failure rates ranged from 0% to 11%, 0% to 26%, and 0% to 20%, respectively. When used, knee autografts resulted in low donor-site morbidity (Lysholm scores, 70-100). <h3>Conclusions</h3> OAT surgery for large, unstable OCD lesions of the capitellum reliably produced good outcomes, few complications, and a high rate of return to competitive play. Complications are relatively uncommon, and donor-site morbidity is low. Less is known about the performance of OCA given the paucity of available literature. <h3>Level of Evidence</h3> Level IV, systematic review of Level II to IV studies.",0

Allogeneic (same species, different individual) or xenogeneic (different species) sources can provide an attractive source of chondrocytes for cartilage tissue engineering, since autologous (same individual) cells are scarce. Immune rejection of non-autologous hyaline articular cartilage has seldom been considered due to the popular notion of ""cartilage immunoprivilege"". The objective of this study was to determine the suitability of allogeneic and xenogeneic engineered neocartilage tissue for cartilage repair. To address this, scaffold-free tissue engineered articular cartilage of syngeneic (same genetic background), allogeneic, and xenogeneic origin were implanted into two different locations of the rabbit knee (n=3 per group/location). Xenogeneic engineered cartilage and control xenogeneic chondral explants provoked profound innate inflammatory and adaptive cellular responses, regardless of transplant location. Cytological quantification of immune cells showed that, while allogeneic neocartilage elicited an immune response in the patella, negligible responses were observed when implanted into the trochlea; instead the responses were comparable to microfracture-treated empty defect controls. Allogeneic neocartilage survived within the trochlea implant site and demonstrated graft integration into the underlying bone. In conclusion, the knee joint cartilage does not represent an immune privileged site, strongly rejecting xenogeneic but not allogeneic chondrocytes in a location-dependent fashion. This difference in location-dependent survival of allogeneic tissue may be associated with proximity to the synovium.Through a series of in vivo studies this research demonstrates that articular cartilage is not fully immunoprivileged. In addition, we now show that anatomical location of the defect, even within the same joint compartment, strongly influences the degree of the resultant immune response. This is one of the first investigations to show that (1) immune tolerance to allogeneic tissue engineered cartilage and (2) subsequent implant survival are dependent on the implant location and proximity to the synovium.",0

We tested the hypothesis that chitosan-stabilized blood clot implant elicits osteoclasts to drilled cartilage defects and promotes repair and cartilage-bone integration.Bilateral trochlear defects in 15 skeletally mature rabbit knees were microdrilled and then treated with chitosan-glycerol phosphate (GP)/blood implant with fluorescent chitosan tracer and thrombin to accelerate in situ solidification or with thrombin alone. Chitosan clearance, osteoclast density, and osteochondral repair were evaluated at 1, 2, and 8 weeks at the outside, edge, and through the proximal microdrill holes.Chitosan was retained at the top of the drill holes at 1 week as extracellular particles became internalized by granulation tissue cells at 2 weeks and was completely cleared by 8 weeks. Osteoclasts burst-accumulated at microdrill hole edges at 1 week, in new woven bone at the base of the drill holes at 2 weeks, and below endochondral cartilage repair at 8 weeks. Implants elicited 2-fold more osteoclasts relative to controls (P < 0.001), a more complete drill hole bone repair, and improved cartilage-bone integration and histological tissue quality. Treated and control 8-week cartilage repair tissues contained 85% collagen type II. After 8 weeks of repair, subchondral osteoclast density correlated positively with bone-cartilage repair tissue integration (P < 0.0005).Chitosan-GP/blood implant amplified the acute influx of subchondral osteoclasts through indirect mechanisms, leading to significantly improved repair and cartilage-bone integration without inducing net bone resorption. Osteoclasts are cellular mediators of marrow-derived cartilage repair integration.",0

The aim of this study was to develop a new bi-layered scaffold for osteochondral tissue regeneration through a ""biomimetic"" and ""bioinspired"" approach. For chondral regeneration, the scaffold was realized with an organic compound (type I collagen), while for the regeneration of the subchondral layer, bioactive magnesium-doped hydroxyapatite (Mg/HA) crystals were co-precipitated with the organic component of the scaffold. The entire scaffold structure was stabilized with a cross-linking agent, highly reactive bis-epoxyde (1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether - BDDGE 1wt%). The developed scaffold was then characterized for its physico-chemical characteristics. Its structure and adhesion strength between the integrated layers were investigated. At the same time, in vitro cell culture studies were carried out to examine the ability of chondral and bone scaffold layers to separately support adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into chondrocytes and osteoblasts, respectively. Moreover, an in vivo study with nude mice, transplanted with osteochondral scaffolds plain or engineered with undifferentiated hMSCs, was also set up with 4 and 8-week time points. The results showed that chondral and bone scaffold layers represented biocompatible scaffolds able to sustain hMSCs attachment and proliferation. Moreover, the association of scaffold stimuli and differentiation medium, induced hMSCs chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). The ectopic implantation of the engineered osteochondral scaffolds indicated that hMSCs were able to colonize the osteochondral scaffold in depth. The scaffold appeared permissive to tissue growth and penetration, ensuring the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen, as also suggested by the presence of a neo-angiogenesis process, especially at 4weeks. Moreover, the in vivo results further confirmed the great potential of the scaffold in tissue engineering, as it was able to support the initial formation of new bone and chondral tissue, confirming the importance of combined and innovative strategies to improve the available therapeutic strategies for chondral and osteochondral regeneration.",0

Previously, the authors implemented a novel 1-step surgical procedure for OCD treatment consisting of matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and simultaneous bone reconstruction including the subchondral lamina. Purpose: This study presents the 2-to 5-year results after this technique, assessing correlations of clinical function and cartilage and bone remodeling processes. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Twenty-six patients with symptomatic condylar knee OCD (International Cartilage Repair Society OCD III/IV) were treated with matrix-associated ACI and monocortical cancellous cylinders for defect filling and subchondral bone plate reconstruction using cortical graft layers as novel subchondral lamina. Evaluations were performed with clinical rating scales and 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging using the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and a newly implemented subchondral lamina remodeling grade. Results: The defect size was 5.3 ± 2.3 cm 2 . The defect depth was 8.7 ± 2.4 mm. After a follow-up of 39.8 ± 12.0 months, all scores improved significantly. Nineteen patients (73%) reached good/excellent results in the Lysholm-Gillquist score (preoperatively: 53.2 ± 18.0 points; latest follow-up: 88.5 ± 9.5 points) and the Cincinnati knee rating score (preoperatively: 51.7 ± 13.0 points; latest follow-up: 84.6 ± 11.7 points) and significant improvements in the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score by 27.9% (preoperatively: 50.5% ± 16.1%; latest follow-up: 78.4% ± 13.4%). The MOCART score reached 62.4 ± 18.9 points. The clinical improvement and tissue remodeling occurred simultaneously and timed; thus, the cartilage defect filling and the lamina remodeling grades correlated significantly with each other, the follow-up time, and almost all clinical scores. Conclusion: The simultaneous reconstruction of deep osteochondral defects of the knee OCD with monocortical cancellous cylinders and matrix-associated ACI is a biological, 1-step alternative to osteochondral cylinder transfer or conventional ACI that leads to good clinical and magnetic resonance imaging results after an intermediate follow-up period. The present study demonstrated simultaneous remodeling processes of articular cartilage repair tissue and subchondral lamina; this synchronization is not yet understood and deserves further investigation.",0

It has been suggested such techniques can be enhanced by covering the defect with scaffolds. We present an innovative approach using a polyglycolic acid (PGA)-hyaluronan scaffold with platelet-rich-plasma (PRP) in drilling.We asked whether (1) PRP immersed in a cell-free PGA-hyaluronan scaffold improves patient-reported 1-year outcomes for the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS), and (2) implantation of the scaffold in combination with bone marrow stimulation leads to the formation of hyaline-like cartilage repair tissue.We reviewed 52 patients who had arthroscopic implantation of the PGA-hyaluronan scaffold immersed with PRP in articular cartilage defects of the knee pretreated with Pridie drilling. Patients were assessed by KOOS. At 9 months followup, histologic staining was performed in specimens obtained from five patients to assess the repair tissue quality.The KOOS subscores improved for pain (55 to 91), symptoms (57 to 88), activities of daily living (69 to 86), sports and recreation (36 to 70), and quality of life (38 to 73). The histologic evaluation showed a homogeneous hyaline-like cartilage repair tissue.The cell-free PGA-hyaluronan scaffold combined with PRP leads to cartilage repair and improved patient-reported outcomes (KOOS) during 12 months of followup. Histologic sections showed morphologic features of hyaline-like repair tissue. Long-term followup is needed to determine if the cartilage repair tissue is durable.Level IV, therapeutic study.

Successful reports have usually involved the seeding of autologous chondrocytes into polymers. Problems arise because of the scarcity of cartilage tissue biopsy material, and because the in vitro expansion of chondrocytes is difficult; to some extent, these problems limit the clinical application of this promising method. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proved a potential cell source because of their in vitro proliferation ability and multilineage differentiation capacity. However, in vitro differentiation will lead to high cost and always results in decreased cell viability. In this study we seeded culture-expanded autologous MSCs into bioceramic scaffold-beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) in an attempt to repair articular cartilage defects (8 mm in diameter and 4 mm in depth) in a sheep model. Twenty-four weeks later, the defects were resurfaced with hyaline-like tissue and an ideal interface between the engineered cartilage, the adjacent normal cartilage, and the underlying bone was observed. From 12 to 24 weeks postimplantation, modification of neocartilage was obvious in the rearrangement of surface cartilage and the increase in glycosaminoglycan level. These findings suggest that it is feasible to repair articular cartilage defects with implants generated by seeding autologous MSCs, without in vitro differentiation, into beta-TCP. This approach provides great potential for clinical applications.",0

The use of tissue-engineered grafts based on scaffolds seems to be as effective as conventional ACI clinically. However, there is limited evidence that scaffold techniques result in homogeneous distribution of cells. Similarly, few studies exist on the maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype in scaffolds. Both of which would be potential advantages over the first generation ACI. The mean clinical score in all of the clinical literature on scaffold techniques significantly improved compared with preoperative values. More than 80% of patients had an excellent or good outcome. None of the short- or mid-term clinical and histological results of these tissue-engineering techniques with scaffolds were reported to be better than conventional ACI. However, some studies suggest that these methods may reduce surgical time, morbidity, and risks of periosteal hypertrophy and post-operative adhesions. Based on the available literature, we were not able to rank the scaffolds available for clinical use. Firm recommendations on which cartilage repair procedure is to be preferred is currently not known on the basis of these studies. Randomized clinical trials and longer follow-up periods are needed for more widespread information regarding the clinical effectiveness of scaffold-based, tissue-engineered cartilage repair.",0

We aimed to explore the feasibility of repair of articular cartilage defects with tissue-engineered cartilage constructed by acellular cartilage matrices (ACMs) seeded with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). The ADSCs were isolated from 3-month-old New Zealand albino rabbit by using collagenase and cultured and amplified in vitro. Fresh cartilage isolated from adult New Zealand albino rabbit were freeze-dried for 12 h and treated with Triton X-100, DNase, and RNase to obtain ACMs. ADSCs were seeded in the acellular cartilaginous matrix at 2x10(7)/mL, and cultured in chondrogenic differentiation medium for 2 weeks to construct tissue-engineered cartilage. Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into A, B, and C groups. Engineered cartilage was transplanted into cartilage defect position of rabbits in group A, group B obtained ACMs, and group C did not receive any transplants. The rabbits were sacrificed in week 12. The restored tissue was evaluated using macroscopy, histology, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the tissue-engineered cartilage group (group A), articular cartilage defects of the rabbits were filled with chondrocyte-like tissue with smooth surface. Immunohistochemistry showed type II-collagen expression and Alcian blue staining was positive. TEM showed chondrocytes in the recesses, with plenty of secretary matrix particles. In the scaffold group (group B), the defect was filled with fibrous tissue. No repaired tissue was found in the blank group (group C). Tissue-engineered cartilage using ACM seeded with ADSCs can help repair articular cartilage defects in rabbits.",0

Although many treatment options are currently available, none fulfills the criteria for an ideal repair solution, including a hyaline repair tissue that completely fills the defect and integrates well with the surrounding normal cartilage. The microfracture technique is an often-utilized, first-line treatment modality for chondral lesions within the knee, resulting in the formation of a fibrocartilaginous repair tissue with inferior biochemical and biomechanical properties compared to normal hyaline cartilage. Although symptomatic improvement has been shown in the short term, concerns about the durability and longevity of the fibrocartilaginous repair have been raised. In response, a number of strategies and techniques for augmentation of the first-generation microfracture procedure have been introduced in an effort to improve repair tissue characteristics and reduce long-term deterioration. Recent experimental approaches utilize modern tissue-engineering technologies including local supplementation of chondrogenic growth factors, hyaluronic acid, or cytokine modulation. Other second-generation microfracture-based techniques use different types of scaffold-guided in situ chondroinduction. The current article presents a comprehensive overview of both the experimental and early clinical results of these developing microfracture augmentation techniques.",0

These lesions can appear in many synovial joints of the body, such as the shoulder, elbow, hip, and ankle, occurring most often in the knee. The term osteochondral lesion includes a vast spectrum of pathologies such as osteochondritis dissecans, osteochondral defects, osteochondral fractures, and osteonecrosis of the subchondral bone. When considering this, the term osteochondral fracture is preserved only for an osteochondral defect that combines disruption of the articular cartilage and subchondral bone. These fractures commonly occur after sports practice and are associated with acute lateral patellar dislocations. Many of these lesions are initially diagnosed by plain radiographs; however, a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can add significant value to the diagnosis and treatment. Treatment methods may vary depending on the location and size of the fracture, fragment instability, and skeletal maturity. The paper reports a 14-year-old boy case with an osteochondral fracture due to sports trauma. The medical approach involved an arthrotomy of the knee, drainage of the hematoma, two Kirschner wires (K-wires) for temporary fixation to restructure anatomic alignment, and a titanium Herbert screw fixing the fracture permanently. The patient had a favorable postoperative outcome with no residual pain, adequate knee stability, and a normal range of motion. The mobility of the knee was fully recovered.",0

The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the role of intraoperatively applied fresh chondrocyte (FC) isolates compared to minced cartilage (MC) fragments, used without cell isolation, to improve bioactivity and tissue integration when combined with a polyurethane replacement.First, to optimize the intraoperative cell isolation protocol, caprine articular cartilage biopsies were digested with 750 U/ml or 3000 U/ml collagenase type II (ratio of 10 ml per g of tissue) for 30 min, 1 h or 12 h with constant agitation and compared to culture-expanded chondrocytes in terms of matrix deposition when cultured on polyurethane scaffolds. Finally, FCs and MC-augmented polyurethane scaffolds were evaluated in a caprine meniscal explant model to assess the potential enhancements on tissue integration strength.Adequate numbers of FCs were harvested using a 30 min chondrocyte isolation protocol and were found to demonstrate improved matrix deposition compared to standard culture-expanded cells in vitro. Upon evaluation in a meniscus explant defect model, both FCs and MC showed improved matrix deposition at the tissue-scaffold interface and enhanced push-out strength, fourfold and 2.5-fold, respectively, compared with the acellular implant.Herein, we have demonstrated a novel approach that could be applied intraoperatively, using FCs or MC for improved tissue integration with a polyurethane meniscal replacement.",0

The potential of subchondral mesenchymal stem cell stimulation for cartilage repair is combined with a membrane technique to enhance efficiency of cartilage regeneration. The nanofractured autologous matrixinduced chondrogenesis (NAMIC©) procedure is suitable for the knee, hip, ankle, shoulder and elbow joints.A standardized subchondral needling procedure (nanofracturing) is combined with fixation of a collagen I/III membrane to regenerate cartilage defects. Its advantages over microfracturing are smaller holes, deeper perforation into the subchondral space, a standardized procedure and earlier rehabilitation of the patient. The collagen membrane protects the blood clot forming after nanofracturing. The NAMIC© procedure may be performed arthroscopically alone, or in a combined arthroscopic setting with a mini-arthrotomy.This is a further development of the AMIC© technology which allows earlier rehabilitation of the patient. The procedure is standardized. Early clinical results are encouraging. Nevertheless, caution is advised in the evaluation of this method as in that of any cartilage regenerating method.The development of standardized subchondral regenerative procedures is important as only reliable clinical studies will give non-biased results. The NAMIC© procedure and the nanofracturing associated with it could be a promising step. As the rehabilitation period may be significantly shortened there is an earlier re-integration of the patient into the working life as compared to the AMIC© procedure.4.",0

Part II: allografts and concurrent procedures,"Young patients with early osteoarthritis (OA) represent a challenging population due to a combination of high functional demands and limited treatment options. Conservative measures such as injection and physical therapy can provide short-term pain relief but are only palliative in nature. Joint replacement, a successful procedure in the older population, is controversial in younger patients, who are less satisfied and experience higher failure rates. Therefore, while traditionally not indicated for the treatment of OA, cartilage repair has become a focus of increased interest due to its potential to provide pain relief and alter the progression of degenerative disease, with the hope of delaying or obviating the need for joint replacement. The field of cartilage repair is seeing the rapid development of new technologies that promise greater ease of application, less demanding rehabilitation and better outcomes. Concurrent procedures such as meniscal transplantation and osteotomy, however, remain of crucial importance to provide a normalized biomechanical environment for these new technologies.

Although some epidemiological data suggest that incidence is associated with first-generation ACI using autologous chondrocyte implantation, it has also been reported in other technical modifications of ACI using different biomaterials. Nevertheless, it has not been described in autologous, non-periosteum, implant-free associated ACI. In addition, little is known about histological and T2-relaxation appearance of graft hypertrophy. The present case report provides a rare case of extensive graft hypertrophy following ACI using an autologous spheres technique with clinical progression over time. Detailed clinical, MR tomographic and histological evaluation has been performed, which demonstrates a high quality of repair tissue within the hypertrophic as well as non-hypertrophic transplanted areas of the repair tissue. No expression of collagen type X (a sign of chondrocyte hypertrophy), only slight changes of the subchondral bone and a nearly normal cell-matrix ratio suggest that tissue within the hypertrophic area does not significantly differ from intact and high-quality repair tissue and therefore seems not to cause graft hypertrophy. This is in contrast to the assumption that histological hypertrophy might cause or contribute to an overwhelming growth of the repair tissue within the transplantation site. Data presented in this manuscript might contribute to further explain the etiology of graft hypertrophy following ACI.",0

Few studies have investigated the clinical and radiographic outcomes of this procedure. We collected the clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients who had undergone JACI-BMAC for talar OCLs to assess treatment efficacy and cartilage repair tissue quality using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Forty-six patients with critical-size OCLs (≥6 mm widest diameter) received JACI-BMAC from 2012 to 2014. We performed a retrospective medical record review and assessed the functional outcomes pre- and postoperatively using the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and Short-Form 12-item general health questionnaire. MRI was performed preoperatively and at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Cartilage morphology was evaluated on postoperative MRI scans using the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage tissue (MOCART) score. The pre- to postoperative changes and relationships between outcomes and lesion size, bone grafting, lesion location, instability, hypertrophy, and MOCART scores were analyzed. Overall, the mean questionnaire scores improved significantly, with almost every FAOS subscale showing significant improvement postoperatively. Concurrent instability resulted in more changes that were statistically significant. The use of bone grafting and the presence of hypertrophy did not result in statistically significant changes in the outcomes. Factors associated with outcomes were lesion size and hypertrophy. Increasing lesion size was associated with decreased FAOS quality of life subscale and hypertrophy correlating with changes in the pain subscale. Of the 46 patients, 22 had undergone postoperative MRI scans that were scored. The average MOCART score was 46.8. Most patients demonstrated a persistent bone marrow edema pattern and hypertrophy of the reparative cartilage. Juvenile articular cartilage implantation of the DeNovo NT allograft and BMAC resulted in improved functional outcome scores; however, the reparative tissue still exhibited fibrocartilage composition radiographically. Further studies are needed to investigate the long-term outcomes and determine the superiority of the arthroscopic DeNovo procedure compared with microfracture and other cartilage resurfacing procedures.",0

However, more and more studies reveal that the injected MSCs have poor adhesion, migration, and survival in the joint cavity. A recent study shows that tropoelastin (TE) regulates adhesion, proliferation and phenotypic maintenance of MSCs as a soluble additive, indicating that TE could promote MSCs-homing in regenerative medicine. In this study, we used TE as injection medium, and compared it with classic media in MSCs intra-articular injection such as normal saline (NS), hyaluronic acid (HA), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). We found that TE could effectively improve adhesion, migration, chondrogenic differentiation of infrapatellar fat pad MSCs (IPFP-MSCs) and enhance matrix synthesis of osteoarthritic chondrocytes (OACs) in indirect-coculture system. Moreover, TE could significantly enhance IPFP-MSCs adhesion via activation of integrin β1, ERK1/2 and vinculin (VCL) in vitro. In addition, intra-articular injection of TE-IPFP MSCs suspension resulted in a short-term increase in survival rate of IPFP-MSCs and better histology scores of rat joint tissues. Inhibition of integrin β1 or ERK1/2 attenuated the protective effect of TE-IPFP MSCs suspension in vivo. In conclusion, TE promotes performance of IPFP-MSCs and protects knee cartilage from damage in OA through enhancement of cell adhesion and activation of integrin β1/ERK/VCL pathway. Our ﬁndings may provide new insights in MSCs intra-articular injection for OA treatment.",0

Purpose: To evaluate the correlation between MRI and clinical outcome after cartilage repair and to identify parameters that are most important in determining clinical outcome. Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic search was performed in Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Collaboration. Articles were screened for relevance and appraised for quality. Guidelines in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) Statement were used. Chi-square tests were performed to find variables that could determine correlation between clinical and radiological parameters. Results: A total of 32 articles (total number of patients, 1019) were included. A majority (81%) were case series or cohort studies that used similar standardized MRI techniques. The mean Coleman score was 63 (range, 42-96). For the majority of MRI parameters, limited or no correlation was found. Nine studies (28%) found a correlation between clinical outcome and the composite magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) or Henderson score and 7 (22%) with defect fill. In 5 studies, a weak to moderate correlation was found between clinical outcome and the T2 index (mean Pearson coefficient r = .53). Conclusion: Strong evidence to determine whether morphological MRI is reliable in predicting clinical outcome after cartilage repair is lacking. Future research aiming specifically at clinical sensitivity of advanced morphological and biochemical MRI techniques after articular cartilage repair could be of great importance to the field.",0

However, the injectable carriers available at present have limitations, and are not used clinically for cartilage regeneration. Here, we report nanofibrous hollow microspheres self-assembled from star-shaped biodegradable polymers as an injectable cell carrier. The nanofibrous hollow microspheres, integrating the extracellular-matrix-mimicking architecture with a highly porous injectable form, were shown to efficiently accommodate cells and enhance cartilage regeneration, compared with control microspheres. The nanofibrous hollow microspheres also supported a significantly larger amount of, and higher-quality, cartilage regeneration than the chondrocytes-alone group in an ectopic implantation model. In a critical-size rabbit osteochondral defect-repair model, the nanofibrous hollow microspheres/chondrocytes group achieved substantially better cartilage repair than the chondrocytes-alone group that simulates the clinically available autologous chondrocyte implantation procedure. These results indicate that the nanofibrous hollow microspheres are an excellent injectable cell carrier for cartilage regeneration.",0

Two different implant devices for articular cartilage regeneration were tested in vivo in a sheep model to evaluate the effect of subchondral bone anchoring for tissue repair. Methods The implants were placed with press-fit technique in a cartilage defect after microfracture surgery in the femoral condyle of the knee joint of the sheep and histologic and mechanical evaluation was done 4.5 months later. The first group consisted of a biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold with double porosity. The second test group consisted of a PCL scaffold attached to a poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) pin anchored to the subchondral bone. Results For both groups most of the defects (75%) showed an articular surface that was completely or almost completely repaired with a neotissue. Nevertheless, the surface had a rougher appearance than controls and the repair tissue was immature. In the trials with solely scaffold implantation, severe subchondral bone alterations were seen with many large nodular formations. These alterations were ameliorated when implanting the scaffold with a subchondral bone anchoring pin. Discussions The results show that tissue repair is improved by implanting a PCL scaffold compared to solely microfracture surgery, and most importantly, that subchondral bone alterations, normally seen after microfracture surgery, were partially prevented when implanting the PCL scaffold with a fixation system to the subchondral bone.",0

To repair complexly shaped cartilage tissue defects, we propose the application of microtissues fabricated from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) cultured in natural bionic nanofibrous microcarriers (NF-MCs). The NF-MCs were structurally and functionally designed to mimic natural extracellular matrix (ECM) by crosslinking dialdehyde bacterial cellulose (DBC) with DL-allo-hydroxylysine (DHYL) and complexing chitosan (CS) with DHYL through electrostatic interactions. The orthogonal design allows for fine tuning of fiber diameter, pore size, porosity, mechanical properties, and biodegradation rate of the NF-MC. BMSCs cultured in NF-MCs showed improved proliferation compared with those cultured in chitosan microcarriers (CS-MCs). After three-week culture under microgravity conditions, functional cartilage microtissues were generated. When implanted into a knee articular cartilage defect in mice, the microtissue showed superior in vivo cartilage repair as characterized by cell tracking, histology, micro CT image, and gait analysis. Versatile in natural biopolymer design and biomimetic in nanofibrous component embedded in macroporous microcarriers, these injectable NC-MCs demonstrate to be effective carriers for cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, the functional microtissues also show their prospect in repair of cartilage tissue, and suggest their potential for other tissues in general.",0

Current clinical options are able to alleviate patient suffering, but cannot sufficiently regenerate the lost tissue. Biomimetic scaffolds that recapitulate the important features of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of cartilage are hypothesized to be advantageous in supporting cell growth, chondrogenic differentiation, and integration of regenerated cartilage with native cartilage, ultimately restoring the injured tissue to its normal function. It remains a challenge to support and maintain articular cartilage regenerated by bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which are prone to hypertrophy and endochondral ossification after implantation in vivo. In the present work, a nanofibrous poly(l-lactic acid) (NF PLLA) scaffold developed by our group was utilized because of the desired highly porous structure, high interconnectivity, and collagen-like NF architecture to support rabbit BMSCs for articular cartilage regeneration. We further hypothesized that matrilin-3 (MATN3), a non-collagenous, cartilage-specific ECM protein, would enhance the microenvironment of the NF PLLA scaffold for cartilage regeneration and maintain the cartilage property. To test this hypothesis, we seeded BMSCs on the NF PLLA scaffold with or without MATN3. We found that MATN3 suppresses hypertrophy in this 3D culture system in vitro. Subcutaneous implantation of the chondrogenic cell/scaffold constructs in a nude mouse model showed that pretreatment with MATN3 was able to maintain chondrogenesis and prevent hypertrophy and endochondral ossification in vivo. These results demonstrate that the porous NF PLLA scaffold treated with MATN3 represents an advantageous 3D microenvironment for cartilage regeneration and phenotype maintenance, and is a promising strategy for articular cartilage repair.Articular cartilage defects, caused by trauma, inflammation, or joint instability, may ultimately lead to debilitating pain and disability. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are an attractive cell source for articular cartilage tissue engineering. However, chondrogenic induction of BMSCs is often accompanied by undesired hypertrophy, which can lead to calcification and ultimately damage the cartilage. Therefore, a therapy to prevent hypertrophy and endochondral ossification is of paramount importance to adequately regenerate articular cartilage. We hypothesized that MATN3 (a non-collagenous ECM protein expressed exclusively in cartilage) may improve regeneration of articular cartilage with BMSCs by maintaining chondrogenesis and preventing hypertrophic transition in an ECM mimicking nanofibrous scaffold. Our results showed that the administration of MATN3 to the cell/nanofibrous scaffold constructs favorably maintained chondrogenesis and prevented hypertrophy/endochondral ossification in the chondrogenic constructs in vitro and in vivo. The combination of nanofibrous PLLA scaffolds and MATN3 treatment provides a very promising strategy to generate chondrogenic grafts with phenotypic stability for articular cartilage repair.",0

Thirty-three patients (20 knees, 13 ankles) were examined 1 to 4 years after operation using MRI, Lysholm Knee Score and Foot and Ankle Osteoarthritis Score. Clinical examination showed pain relief and improved function and MRI images demonstrated graft incorporation. Radiological criteria such as articular step-off, subchondral lamina irregularity, subchondral oedema and inhomogeneity of the graft interface opposed to the host tissue do not correlate statistically with the clinical outcome.

Synovial mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an attractive cell source for meniscus regeneration due to their high proliferation and chondrogenic potential. We examined the effect of repetitive intraarticular injections of synovial MSCs on meniscus regeneration in a massive meniscal defect of pigs. We followed up the efficacy using MRI evaluation in addition to macroscopic and histological observations.Two weeks before the injection of synovial MSCs, the anterior half of the medial menisci was resected in both knees of pigs. Fifty million allogeneic synovial MSCs were injected into the right knee at 0, 2, and 4 weeks and followed up by sequential MRI. The regenerated meniscus, adjacent articular cartilage, and subchondral bone were evaluated by MRI at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. They were also evaluated macroscopically and histologically at 16 weeks (n = 7).The resected meniscus regenerated significantly better in the MSC group than in the control group based on histological and MRI analyses. Macroscopically, the meniscal defect already appeared to be filled with synovial tissue at 2 weeks. Articular cartilage and subchondral bone at the medial femoral condyle were also significantly more preserved in the MSC group based on MRI, macroscopic, and histological analyses.Intraarticular injections of allogeneic synovial MSCs appeared to promote meniscus regeneration and provide protection at the medial femoral articular cartilage in a porcine massive meniscal defect model.",0

This study explored the feasibility of repairing articular osteochondral defects using autologous BMSCs and biodegradable polymers. BMSCs from 18 hybrid pigs’ marrows were either treated with dexamethasone (40 ng/mL) alone or chondrogenically induced with dexamethasone and transforming growth factor-β1 (10 ng/mL). The cells were seeded respectively onto polylactic acid (PLA)- coated polyglycolic acid (PGA) scaffolds. Four osteochondral defects in each animal were created at nonweightbearing areas of knee joints (2/each side) and were respectively repaired by a chondrogenically induced BMSC-PGA/PLA construct in experimental group (Exp), by a dexamethasone-treated BMSC-PGA/PLA construct in control 1 group (Ctrl 1), by a PGA/PLA construct alone in control 2 group (Ctrl 2), or left unrepaired in control 3 group (Ctrl 3). To trace the implanted cells, green fluorescent protein (GFP)- labeled BMSCs were implanted in 2 animals. Gross view and histology showed that Exp and Ctrl 1 (with cell implantation) achieved better reparative results than Ctrl 2 and Ctrl 3 (without cell implantation) in terms of the reparative level and the restoration of the histological structure. In addition, 6-month results were better than 3-month results in all 4 groups. In Exp, 11 of 16 defects were completely repaired by hyaline cartilage and cancellous bone. In Ctrl 1, 11 of 16 defects were repaired by fibrocartilage and cancellous bone, although the repair with hyaline cartilage and cancellous bone was observed in 5 of 16 defects. In contrast, no obvious repair or only fibrotic tissue was observed in Ctrl 2 and Ctrl 3. The compressive moduli of repaired cartilage in Exp reached 80.27% of the normal amount at 6 months, with a high level of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content (no statistical difference from normal). In Ctrl 1, the compressive moduli and GAG content were 62.69% and 78.03% of normal levels, respectively. More importantly, GFP-labeled cells were detected in the engineered cartilage and the repaired subchondral bone. These results strongly indicate that the implanted BMSCs can differentiate into either chondrocytes or osteoblasts and repair articular osteochondral defects by forming engineered cartilage and engineered bone.",0

For patients in whom nonsurgical management fails, promising results have been reported after arthroscopic microfracture surgery to treat such lesions. However, microfracture leads to growth of fibrocartilage tissue and is biomechanically less durable than native hyaline cartilage. Recently, augmentation of the microfractured defect with micronized allogeneic cartilage and platelet-rich plasma has been described to restore hyaline-like cartilage and potentially protect the subchondral bone from postsurgical fracture biology within the base of the defect. We present a simple arthroscopic technique of implanting dehydrated, micronized allogeneic cartilage scaffold to treat an isolated chondral lesion of the glenoid.",0

Arthroscopic osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT) and microfracture arthroplasty (MFx) were performed in knees of 10 equine subjects (seven female, three male; age range, 3-5 years). A site of arthroscopically normal cartilage was documented in each joint as a control site. Joints were harvested at 12 (n = 5) and 24 (n = 5) weeks postoperatively and were imaged at 1.5-T magnetic resonance (MR) with a 10-echo sagittal fast spin-echo acquisition. T2 maps of each site (21 OAT harvest, 10 MFx, 12 OAT plug, and 10 control sites) were calculated with linear least-squares curve fitting. Cartilage T2 maps were qualitatively graded as ""organized"" (normal transition of low-to-high T2 signal from deep to superficial cartilage zones) or ""disorganized."" Quantitative mean T2 values were calculated for deep, middle, and superficial cartilage at each location. Results were compared with histologic and PLM assessments by using kappa analysis.T2 maps were qualitatively graded as organized at 20 of 53 sites and as disorganized at 33 sites. Perfect agreement was seen between organized T2 and histologic findings of hyaline cartilage and between disorganized T2 and histologic findings of fibrous reparative tissue (kappa = 1.0). Strong agreement was seen between organized T2 and normal PLM findings and between disorganized T2 and abnormal PLM findings (kappa = .92). Quantitative assessment of the deep, middle, and superficial cartilage, respectively, showed mean T2 values of 53.3, 58.6, and 54.9 msec at reparative fibrous tissue sites and 40.7, 53.6, and 61.6 msec at hyaline cartilage sites. A significant trend of increasing T2 values (from deep to superficial) was found in hyaline cartilage (P < .01). Fibrous tissue sites had no significant change with depth (P > .59).Qualitative and quantitative T2 mapping helped differentiate hyaline cartilage from reparative fibrocartilage after cartilage repair at 1.5-T MR imaging.",0

Subchondral bone sclerosis, irreparable joint damage, and the early onset of osteoarthritis make the injured meniscus heal difficultly.The study was performed by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The in vitro experiments were carried out using the bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) isolated from the rabbits, and the stemness of the BMSCs was tested by immunostaining. The BMSCs positively expressed stem cell markers were cultured with various concentrations of kartogenin (KGN) for 2 weeks. The chondrogenesis of BMSCs induced by KGN was examined by histochemical staining and quantitative RT-PCR. The in vivo experiments were completed by a rabbit model. Three holes were created in each meniscus by a biopsy punch. The rabbits were treated with four different conditions in each group. Group 1 was treated with 20 μl of saline (saline); group 2 was treated with 5 μl of 100 μM KGN and 15 μl saline (KGN); group 3 was treated with 5 μl of 100 μM KGN, 5 μl of 10,000 U/ ml thrombin, and 10 μl of PRP (KGN+PRP); group 4 was treated with 10,000 BMSCs in 10 μl of PRP, 5 μl of saline solution, and 5 μl of 10,000 U/ml thrombin (PRP+BMSC); group 5 was treated with 10,000 BMSCs in 10 μl of PRP, 5 μl of 100 μM KGN, and 5 μl of 10,000 U/ml thrombin (KGN+PRP+BMSC). The menisci were collected at day 90 post-surgery for gross inspection and histochemical analysis.The histochemical staining showed that KGN induced chondrogenesis of BMSCs in a concentration-dependent manner. The RT-PCR results indicated that chondrocyte-related genes were also increased in the BMSCs cultured with KGN in a dose-dependent manner. The in vivo results showed that large unhealed wound areas were still found in the wounds treated with saline and KGN groups. The wounds treated with BMSCs-containing PRP gel healed much faster than the wounds treated without BMSCs. Furthermore, the wounds treated with BMSCs-containing KGN-PRP gel have healed completely and formed more cartilage-like tissues than the wounds treated with BMSCs-containing PRP gel.BMSCs could be differentiated into chondrocytes when they were cultured with KGN-PRP gel in vitro and formed more cartilage-like tissues in the wounded rabbit meniscus when the wounds were treated with BMSCs-containing KGN-PRP gel. The results indicated that the BMSCs-containing KGN-PRP gel is a good substitute for injured meniscus repair and regeneration.",0

To overcome these limitations, we constructed a functional biomaterial using a biphasic scaffold platform and a bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-specific affinity peptide. The biphasic scaffold platform retains more cells homogeneously within the sol-gel transition of chitosan and provides sufficient solid matrix strength. This biphasic scaffold platform is functionalized with an affinity peptide targeting a cell source of interest, BMSCs. The presence of conjugated peptide gives this system a biological functionality towards BMSC-specific homing both in vitro and in vivo. The functional biomaterial can stimulate stem cell proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation during in vitro culture. Six months after in vivo implantation, compared with routine surgery or control scaffolds, the functional biomaterials induced superior cartilage repair without complications, as indicated by histological observations, magnetic resonance imaging and biomechanical properties. Beyond cartilage repair, this functional biphasic scaffold may provide a biomaterial framework for one-step tissue engineering strategy by homing endogenous cells to stimulate tissue regeneration.",0

Autologous rabbit knee articular chondrocytes were seeded within bilayer collagen I/III 3-D matrices in variation of P, C and T. Each time, 2 PCT-identical by 2 PCT-identical cell-matrix-constructs (CMC)/animal were created. Simultaneously 2 (PCT-distinct) were re-implanted (CMC-e) autologous into artificial trochlear pristine chondral defects in vivo to remain for 12 weeks while the remaining 2 were harvested (CMC-i) for immediate in vitro analysis at the time of transplantation of their identical twins. mRNA of both, CMC-e regenerates and CMC-i membranes, was analyzed for Collagen-1,-2,-10, COMP, Aggrecan, Sox9 expression by use of a mixed linear model, multiple regression analysis. Generally, CMC-i values were higher than CMC-e values for differentiation targets; the opposite was true for dedifferentiation targets. Regarding individual gene expression, in vivo regenerate cell-matrix properties were significantly dependent on initial cell-matrix in vitro values as a sign of linearity. The parameter membrane-holding time (T) had strongest effects on the resulting mRNA expression with slightly less impact of the parameter passage (P), whereas cell yield (C) had clearly less effects. Noting differences between in vitro and in vivo data, in general, optimal expression patterns concerning chondrogenic differentiation were achieved by few passages, medium cellular yield, short membrane-holding time. Clinical m-ACI may benefit from optimal orchestration of the cell culture parameters passage, yield and time.",0

The causes of humeral head osteochondral lesions are variable, but these lesions most commonly result from trauma and recurrent glenohumeral instability. Palliative and reparative techniques such as arthroscopic debridement and microfracture have traditionally been used as surgical treatment but have high failure rates. Similarly to surgical trends in the knee, cartilage restoration in the shoulder is becoming more prevalent in younger patients. Osteochondral allograft transplantation (OAT) has been used as a joint-preserving surgical option to restore hyaline cartilage in multiple joints for decades. Although OAT is more commonly used to re-establish the subchondral bony architecture in the treatment of recurrent shoulder instability, the procedure may also be indicated in young, active patients with focal humeral head chondral defects. OAT has been shown in early studies to provide improvement in functional outcome scores and good long-term graft survival with relatively low rates of complications. This report describes our straightforward, reproducible technique for the treatment of large, oblong chondral defects of the humeral head using OAT.",0

The reasons for reoperations were recorded.We reviewed 66 articles from the 301 articles identified in the original systematic search. There were 60 articles on matrix-assisted cartilage transplantation and 6 articles on matrix-induced chondrogenesis. The matrix-assisted cartilage transplantation studies reported on a total of 1,380 patients at 2 to 5 years' follow-up. Among these, there were 72 reoperations (5%) including 46 treatment failures (3%). These numbers increased to an 11% reoperation rate and 9% treatment failure rate at minimum 5-year follow-up of 961 patients. The most common procedures performed other than revision cartilage surgery or arthroplasty were manipulation under anesthesia for arthrofibrosis (0.7%) and debridement for graft hypertrophy (1.2%). The matrix-induced chondrogenesis studies reported on 163 patients. Among these, there were 15 reoperations (9%) that included 4 treatment failures (2%), 9 manipulations under anesthesia (6%), and 2 debridements for graft hypertrophy (1%).Treatment failure rates for matrix-assisted cartilage repair increase from short-term to midterm follow-up, with 11% of patients having undergone further surgery at a minimum of 5 years' follow-up. These data can be used to counsel patients on the potential need for further operative intervention after this emerging cartilage repair technique.",0

The operative management of these focal chondral lesions continues to be a regenerative challenge. The microfracture (MFx) procedure has become a first-line arthroscopic treatment method for small, symptomatic chondral lesions, and it frequently serves as the standard technique against which other cartilage repair procedures are compared. Over time, outcome studies have defined the weaknesses and limitations of first-generation MFx. The second iteration of MFx seeks to optimize regeneration using the trilogy of cells, scaffolds, and growth factors. As surgeons, we are only as strong as our weakest link.",0

The resulting repair tissue was assessed, 6 and 26 weeks after transplantation, by histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. The biomechanical properties of the repair tissue were characterized by nanoindentation measurements. Implants of unstimulated cells and untreated lesions served as controls.All grafts showed satisfactory integration into the preexisting cartilage. Six weeks after transplantation, AAV/Ad-stimulated periosteal cells had adopted a chondrocyte-like phenotype in all layers; the newly formed matrix was rich in proteoglycans and type II collagen, and its contact stiffness was close to that of healthy hyaline cartilage. Unstimulated periosteal cells and cells activated by liposomal gene transfer formed only fibrocartilaginous repair tissue with minor contact stiffness. However, within 6 months following transplantation, the AAV/Ad-stimulated cells in the superficial zone tended to dedifferentiate, as indicated by a switch from type II to type I collagen synthesis and reduced contact stiffness. In deeper zones, these cells retained their chondrocytic phenotype, coinciding with positive staining for type II collagen in the matrix.Large partial-thickness cartilage defects can be resurfaced efficiently with hyaline-like cartilage formed by transgene-activated periosteal cells. The long-term stability of the cartilage seems to depend on physicobiochemical factors that are active only in deeper zones of the cartilaginous tissue.",0

Human osteoarthritic chondrocytes were harvest from nine different patients (mean +/- A SD age 68 +/- A 8 years) who underwent total knee replacement. The chondrocytes were embedded after a precultivation phase into a collagen I hydrogel. Mid-term intermitted mechanostimulation on matrix-embedded dedifferentiated human osteoarthritic chondrocytes was performed by intermittently applying a cyclic sinusoid compression regime for 4 days (cycles of 1 h of sinusoidal stimulation (1 Hz) and 4 h of break; maximum compression 2.5 %). Stimulated (Flex) and non-stimulated (No Flex) cell matrix constructs were analysed concerning the expression of genes involved in tissue metabolism, the content of sulphated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) and the morphology of the chondrocytes. Gene expression analysis showed a high significant increase in collagen type II expression (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001), a significant increase in aggrecan expression (p \textbackslashtextless 0.04) and a high significant decrease in MMP-13 expression (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001) under stimulation condition compared with unstimulated controls. No significant changes were found in the gene expression rate of MMP-3. This positive effect of the mechanostimulation was confirmed by the analyses of sGAG. Mechanically stimulated cell-matrix constructs had nearly tripled sGAG content than the non-stimulated control (p \textbackslashtextless 0.002). In addition, histological examination showed that morphology of chondrocytes was altered from a spindle-shaped to a chondrocyte-characteristic rounded phenotype. Mid-term intermitted mechanical stimulation in vitro has the potential to improve the cell quality of cell matrix constructs prepared from dedifferentiated osteoarthritic chondrocytes. This observation may extend the inclusion criteria for matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) and confirms the importance of moderate dynamic compression in clinical rehabilitation after MACI.",0

The aims of this study were to investigate the use of a scaffold-assisted microfracture approach, employing a novel, multilayered, collagen-based, osteochondral graft substitute in the treatment of severe osteochondritis dissecans of both lateral femoral trochlear ridges in an equine athlete, and to assess the potential of this novel scaffold to enhance repair of the osteochondral unit. A 15 month-old female filly presented with large osteochondritis dissecans lesions involving both femoral lateral trochlear ridges. After routine arthroscopic debridement and microfracture of the subchondral bone, multilayered osteochondral defect repair scaffolds were implanted into the fragmentation beds in both left and right femoropatellar joints via mini-arthrotomies. Exploratory arthroscopy 5 months postimplantation revealed smooth cartilaginous repair tissue, contiguous with the adjacent cartilage, covering the defect. At 22-month follow up, the filly had no signs of lameness and was exercising at her intended level. Radiographically, although still slightly flattened, the femoral trochlear ridges were smooth, with no evidence of osteoarthritis. Ultrasonographically, the defects were filled with bone and covered with an overlying cartilaginous layer, with the trochlear ridge contour almost entirely restored. This report demonstrates the effective clinical use of this novel, multilayered, osteochondral defect repair scaffold in the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of an equine athlete. The successful repair achieved here using this novel scaffold in an equine patient with large bilateral lesions shows the potential for clinical translation in the treatment of human patients presenting with osteochondral defects.

She was referred to our department with the diagnosis of aseptic necrosis already made and after repeated arthroscopic treatment of the elbow including removal of a loose body in another institution. Exercise-related pain and swelling of the elbow became permanent and did not allow her to pursue her sports activities. After thorough examination, the treatment by implantation of autologous cultured chondrocytes, as a solid chondrograft, was chosen. At the first stage of arthroscopic surgery, a loose body was removed and a sample of healthy cartilage from an articular region not subject to strain was collected. The sample was sent to the Tissue Bank for cultivation and chondrocyte formation into a solid chondrograft, a procedure taking 4 to 5 weeks. At the second stage, the chondrograft was implanted into the lesion site and fixed with tissue glue (Tissucol). The arm was immobilised in a plaster cast for 4 weeks. The patient was followed up clinically and examined with magnetic resonance imaging at 6 month after implantation. The examination showed full graft integration and the arm's return to full mobility without pain at exercise. Even with this rare lesion site within the elbow joint, the implantation of a solid chondrograft proved to be a method achieving very good outcomes.",0

Recently established procedures like autologous chondrocyte implantation or matrix-associated chondrocyte implantation yield good results, but include the disadvantage of two-step procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcome of repairs of osteochondral defects of the knee by a combined procedure of bone grafting and covering with a bilayer collagen membrane in a sandwich technique. Seven male patients with a mean age of 42 (range 30-55) years and symptomatic focal osteochondral lesions of the knee grade IV according to the International Cartilage Repair Society classification were included. The mean diameter of defects was 28.6 (range 15-40) mm. Results were evaluated at a minimum of 24 months after surgery by International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm-score, visual analogue scale, and magnetic resonance imaging with specific cartilage sequences, evaluating the ICRS score and the Magnetic Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score. All patients judged the operation as successful. Among the patients available for the long-term follow-up, mean visual analogue scale value was 1.3 (range 0-3) out of 10 points. Mean International Knee Documentation Committee score was 80.8 (range 63.2-88.5) out of 100 points. Mean Lysholm score was 85 (range 55-95) out of 100 points. None of the patients had to be reoperated until today. Evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging using the MOCART score revealed a good correlation to the clinical outcome. This is the first study reporting results after reconstruction of osteochondral defects of the knee joint by bone grafting and a bilayer collagen membrane. This new method offers the advantage of a one-step-procedure and yields both good clinical and magnetic resonance findings. We conclude that this procedure can be a valuable tool to improve joint function after osteochondral defects, trauma, and in joints with local arthritic lesions.",0

Continuously graded interfacial designs, where there is no discrete transition from one tissue type to another, are gaining attention as an alternative to stratified designs. Given that osteochondral regeneration holds the potential to enhance cartilage regeneration by leveraging the healing capacity of the underlying bone, we endeavored to introduce a continuously-graded approach to osteochondral regeneration. The purpose of this study was thus to evaluate the performance of a novel gradient-based scaffolding approach to regenerate osteochondral defects in the New Zealand White rabbit femoral condyle. Bioactive plugs were constructed from poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres with a continuous gradient transition between cartilage-promoting and bone-promoting growth factors. At 6 and 12 weeks of healing, results suggested that the implants provided support for the neo-synthesized tissue, and the gradient in bioactive signaling may have been beneficial for bone and cartilage regeneration compared to the blank control implant, as evidenced by histology. In addition, the effects of preseeding gradient scaffolds with umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (UCMSCs) from the Wharton's jelly of New Zealand White rabbits were evaluated. Results indicated that there may be regenerative benefits to prelocalizing UCMSCs within scaffold interiors. The inclusion of bioactive factors in a gradient-based scaffolding design is a promising new treatment strategy for defect repair in the femoral condyle. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The correlation between MRI and clinical outcomes is not well understood. Hypothesis: Postoperative MRI findings correlate with clinical outcome measures in patients after articular cartilage surgery of the knee. Study Design: Meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify studies in which MRI and clinical outcomes were correlated after autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), osteochondral autograft transfer system (OATS), or microfracture. Studies that reported correlation coefficients ( r) for different MRI parameters were then included in a meta-analysis. Results: A total of 26 studies were identified for inclusion in this systematic review, 15 of which were included in the meta-analysis. Most of the studies (n = 19) involved ACI, although studies were available for OATS (n = 5) and microfracture (n = 4). The strongest MRI correlates with clinical outcomes after ACI were graft hypertrophy ( r = 0.72) and repair tissue signal ( r = 0.71). After microfracture, the strongest MRI correlates were the Henderson score ( r = 0.97), subchondral edema ( r = 0.77), and repair tissue signal ( r = 0.76). Correlations after OATS were not as strong, with defect fill ( r = 0.53) and repair tissue structure ( r = 0.51) being the strongest. Conclusion: The MRI findings do correlate with clinical outcomes after cartilage repair surgery in the knee, although the specific parameters that correlate best vary by the type of procedure performed. No current MRI classification system has been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes after all types of cartilage repair surgery.",0

The cartilage repair site was assessed at 6 weeks and 6 months after implantation by histology, immunohistochemistry, and magnetic resonance imaging evaluation.NC-based grafts, independently of their composition, induced partial hyaline cartilage repair with stable integrity in surrounding healthy tissue at 6 months after treatment. The SCA repaired cartilage to a similar degree to that of NC-based grafts.Kissing lesion repair, as evidenced in this sheep study, demonstrated the feasibility of the treatment of complex cartilage injuries with advanced biological methods. However, the potential advantages of an NC-based approach over a cell-free approach warrant further investigations in a more relevant preclinical model.NC-based grafts currently undergoing phase II clinical trials have a high potential to replace existing cartilage therapies that show significant limitations in the quality and reproducibility of the repair method. We have brought this innovative concept to the next level by addressing a new clinical indication.",0

The visual analog scale score for pain during daily activities, American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society hindfoot and ankle scores, and subjective satisfaction survey rating were obtained. Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging of the ankle were obtained before and after surgery. In 13 cases second-look arthroscopy was performed 12 months postoperatively and the cartilage repair was assessed with the criteria of the International Cartilage Repair Society.Sixteen patients were available for follow-up at a mean of 32.6 months (range, 24 to 48 months). The mean visual analog scale score decreased from 5.51 ± 0.83 preoperatively to 0.98 ± 0.98 at the latest follow-up, and the median American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society score improved from 75 preoperatively to 90 at the latest follow-up. Seven patients resumed sporting activities. Overall, 7 patients rated the result as excellent, 8 as good, and 1 as fair. The radiolucent area of the cysts disappeared on the plain radiographs in all cases. The mean Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue score was 60 ± 9.4 points, whereas subchondral bone edema persisted on the postoperative magnetic resonance images in 16 cases. The mean International Cartilage Repair Society arthroscopic score for cartilage repair at second-look arthroscopy was 9 ± 1.4 points.Autologous iliac crest osteoperiosteal cylinder graft transplantation with supplemental bone grafting is a simple, safe, and effective procedure for treatment of large cystic medial OLT.

HA has been incorporated in a number of biomaterial and scaffold systems. However, HA in the material may be difficult to control if it is not chemically modified and chemical modification of HA may negatively impact biological function. In this study, we developed a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel with noncovalent HA-binding capabilities and evaluated its ability to support cartilage formation in vitro and in an articular defect model. Chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells encapsulated in the HA-interactive scaffolds containing various amounts of exogenous HA was evaluated. The HA-binding hydrogel without exogenous HA produced the best cartilage as determined by biochemical content (glysocaminoglycan and collagen), histology (Safranin O and type II collagen staining), and gene expression analysis for aggrecan, type I collagen, type II collagen, and sox-9. This HA-binding formulation was then translated to an osteochondral defect model in the rat knee. After 6 weeks, histological analysis demonstrated improved cartilage tissue production in defects treated with the HA-interactive hydrogel compared to noninteractive control scaffolds and untreated defects. In addition to the tissue repair in the defect space, the Safranin O staining in cartilage tissue surrounding the defect was greater in treatment groups where the HA-binding scaffold was applied. In sum, incorporation of a noncovalent HA-binding functionality into biomaterials provides an ability to interact with local or exogenous HA, which can then impact tissue remodeling and ultimately new tissue production.",0

However, microfracture often results in filling of the chondral defect with fibrocartilage, which exhibits poor durability and sub-optimal mechanical properties. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a potent chemoattractant for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and is expressed at high levels in bone marrow adjacent to developing cartilage during endochondral bone formation. Integrating SDF-1 into an implantable collagen scaffold may provide a chondro-conductive and chondro-inductive milieu via chemotaxis of MSCs and promotion of chondrogenic differentiation, facilitating more robust hyaline cartilage formation following microfracture.This work aimed to confirm the chemoattractive properties of SDF-1 in vitro and develop a one-step method for incorporating SDF-1 in vivo to enhance cartilage repair using a rat osteochondral defect model.Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) were harvested from the femurs of Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, with the medium changed every 3 days. Passage 1 MSCs were analyzed by flow cytometry with an S3 Cell Sorter (Bio-Rad). In vitro cell migration assays were performed on MSCs by labeling cells with carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE; Bio-Rad). For the microfracture model, a 1.6-mm-diameter osteochondral defect was created in the femoral trochleae of 20 Sprague-Dawley rats bilaterally until bone marrow spillage was seen under saline irrigation. One knee was chosen at random to receive implantation of the scaffold, and the contralateral knee was left unfilled as an empty control. Type I collagen scaffolds (Kensey Nash) were coated with either gelatin only or gelatin and SDF-1 using a dip coating process. The rats received implantation of either a gelatin-only scaffold (N = 10) or gelatin-and-SDF-1 scaffold (N = 10) at the site of the microfracture. Femurs were collected for histological analyses at 4- and 8-week time points post-operatively, and sections were stained with Safranin O/Fast Green. The samples were graded blindly by two observers using the Modified O'Driscoll score, a validated scoring system for chondral repair. A minimum of 10 separate grading scores were made per sample and averaged. Quantitative comparisons of cell migration in vitro were performed with one-way ANOVA. Cartilage repair in vivo was also compared among groups with one-way ANOVA, and the results were presented as mean ± standard deviation, with P-values < 0.05 considered as statistically significant.MSC migration showed a dose-response relationship with SDF-1, with an optimal dosage for chemotaxis between 10 and 100 ng/ml. After scaffold implantation, the SDF-1-treated group demonstrated complete filling of the cartilage defect with mature cartilage tissue, exhibiting strong proteoglycan content, smooth borders, and good incorporation into marginal cartilage. Modified O'Driscoll scores after 8 weeks showed a significant improvement of cartilage repair in the SDF-1 group relative to the empty control group (P < 0.01), with a trend toward improvement when compared with the gelatin-only-scaffold group (P < 0.1). No significant differences in scores were found between the empty defect group and gelatin-only group.In this study, we demonstrated a simple method for improving the quality of cartilage defect repair in a rat model of microfracture. We confirmed the chemotactic properties of SDF-1 on rat MSCs and found an optimized dosage range for chemotaxis between 10 and 100 ng/ml. Furthermore, we demonstrated a strategy to incorporate SDF-1 into gelatin-collagen I scaffolds in vivo at the site of an osteochondral defect. SDF-1-treated defects displayed robust hyaline cartilage resurfacing of the defect with minimal fibrous tissue, in contrast to the empty control group. The results of the in vitro and in vivo studies together suggest that SDF-1-mediated signaling may significantly improve the quality of cartilage regeneration in an osteochondral defect.",0

Five study groups were defined: (a) gellan gum with encapsulated chondrogenic predifferentiated rabbit adipose stem cells (ASC + GF); (b) gellan gum with encapsulated nonchondrogenic predifferentiated rabbit adipose stem cells (ASC); (c) gellan gum with encapsulated rabbit articular chondrocytes (AC) (standard control); (d) gellan gum alone (control); (e) empty defect (control). Full-thickness articular cartilage defects were created and the gellan gum constructs were injected and left for 8 weeks. The macroscopic aspect of the explants showed a progressive increase of similarity with the lateral native cartilage, stable integration at the defect site, more pronouncedly in the cell-loaded constructs. Tissue scoring showed that ASC + GF exhibited the best results regarding tissue quality progression. Alcian blue retrieved similar results with a better outcome for the cell-loaded constructs. Regarding real-time PCR analyses, ASC + GF had the best progression with an upregulation of collagen type II and aggrecan, and a downregulation of collagen type I. Gellan gum hydrogels combined with autologous cells constitute a promising approach for the treatment of articular cartilage defects, and adipose derived cells may constitute a valid alternative to currently used articular chondrocytes.",0

The ability for ADM to promote cellular repopulation, revascularisation and tissue regeneration is well documented. Adipose stem cells have the ability to differentiate into mesenchymal tissue types, including bone and cartilage. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential interaction between ADM and adipose stem cells in vitro using TGFβ3 and BMP6. Human infrapatellar fat pad-derived adipose stem cells (IPFP-ASC) were cultured with ADM derived from rat dermis in chondrogenic (TGFβ3 and BMP6) medium in vitro for 2 and 4 weeks. Histology, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess for markers of chondrogenesis (collagen Type II, SOX9 and proteoglycans). At 4 weeks, cell-scaffold constructs displayed cellular changes consistent with chondrogenesis, with evidence of stratification of cell layers and development of a hyaline-like cartilage layer superficially, which stained positively for collagen Type II and proteoglycans. Significant cell-matrix interaction was seen between the cartilage layer and the ADM itself with seamless integration between each layer. Real time qPCR showed significantly increased COL2A1, SOX9, and ACAN gene expression over 4 weeks when compared to control. COL1A2 gene expression remained unchanged over 4 weeks. We believe that the principles that make ADM versatile and successful for tissue regeneration are applicable to cartilage regeneration. This study demonstrates in vitro the ability for IPFP-ASCs to undergo chondrogenesis, infiltrate, and interact with ADM. These outcomes serve as a platform for in vivo modelling of ADM for cartilage repair.",0

The standard algorithm uses clinical information, conventional radiographs, MRI and CT scan, while the trial algorithm uses the same information but SPECT/CT in addition.MethodsIn a diagnostic comparative trial three experienced surgeons evaluated 23 consecutive patients with persistent symptoms after ACL reconstruction using first standard and second the trial algorithm with a time interval. Each rater had to establish a diagnosis and therapeutic decision with each algorithm. On MRI, graft continuity, bone marrow edema, chondral and meniscal lesions, femoral notch osteophytes were evaluated. Bone tracer uptake in SPECT/CT was anatomically analyzed and compared with MRI findings. MRI findings and SPECT/CT tracer uptake were correlated using Spearman's rho test.ResultsAdditional SPECT/CT analysis did not change diagnosis in any case and did not correlate with clinical graft integrity. Treatment decisions remained unchanged as well. Chondral lesions, arthritic changes, meniscal lesions, graft impingement are best visualized in MRI and showed correspondent tracer uptake in SPECT/CT. Tunnel position was well classified with standard CT scan and showed no correlation with SPECT/CT tracer uptake.ConclusionInformation derived by SPECT/CT in addition to the standard algorithm using clinical information, X-rays, MRI, and CT scan did not change the diagnosis or treatment plan. There is currently no justification to implement SPECT/CT for patients with persistent symptoms after anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions.Level of evidenceLevel II: diagnostic comparative study.",0

Multiple strategies have been used to treat these lesions, including microfracture and osteochondral plug transfer. We describe a patient experiencing chronic knee pain and a full-thickness cartilage defect on the lateral femoral condyle. After failing conservative management and microfracture surgery, the patient underwent osteochondral autograft plug transfer, with backfilling of the donor sites using synthetic bone graft substitute. Initial recovery was uncomplicated until the patient experienced pain following a twist of the knee. Magnetic resonance imaging for the subsequent knee injury revealed poor healing at the donor sites. The donor sites were debrided, and specimens revealed a foreign body giant cell reaction. Donor-site morbidity is of primary concern during osteochondral plug transfer; however, insufficient data exist to support the use of synthetic bone graft material. Our results indicate that off-label use of synthetic bone graft substitute during a primary procedure requires further investigation.",0

Defects of the experimental group were, on the other hand, filled with cartilaginous tissue as early as 2 weeks posttransplantation, although individual epiphyses could still be noted in the implant tissue. At 4 weeks and later, defects were filled with cartilaginous material indistinguishable from hyaline cartilage. Histologically, all grafts remained within the defect's pits, showing mitotic and metabolic activity typical to proliferating hyaline cartilage. The engrafted epiphyses showed a partial incorporation and integration with the surrounding host tissues already at 2 weeks. At 4 weeks and later, the integration was complete. Conclusion It is concluded that a chick embryonic epiphyseal cartilage is suitable as a graft source for articular cartilage transplantation. The embryonic epiphyses provide immediate inherent stability to the graft and supply a good mix of mesenchymal progenitor cells responsible for the high rate of cell proliferation and adhesion to the differentiated committed chondrocytes of the host that create the typical favorable chondrogenic milieu. Based on the present findings, it is postulated that human embryonic epiphyses may, in the future, represent an alternative source to the commonly used techniques of hyaline cartilage repair.",0

This review covers the use of fibrin gel polymer as an injectable scaffold for generating new cartilage matrix from isolated articular chondrocytes beginning with studies in mice and culminating in an applied study in swine joints. These studies began with developing a formulation of fibrin that was injectable and promoted cartilage matrix formation. Subsequent studies addressed the problems of volume loss after the scaffolds were placed in vivo by adding lyophilized cartilage matrix. Additional studies focused on the ability of isolated chondrocytes to heal and repair cartilage in a model that could be biomechanically tested. In conclusion, this series of studies demonstrated that fibrin gel is a suitable polymer gel for generating new cartilage matrix from articular chondrocytes. The new matrix is capable of forming mechanical bonds between cartilage disks and can lead to healing and integration. Armed with these results, implantation of fibrin-cell constructs into defects in swine knees showed new cartilage formation and filling of the defects. Continuing work in these models with fibrin and other polymerizable hydrogels could result in a suitable cell-based therapy for articular cartilage lesions.",0

Previously, there were limited treatment options available to patients who suffered from either partial-thickness or full-thickness cartilage lesions. Because articular cartilage has a limited capacity for healing, patients were often treated symptomatically until they became candidates for osteotomy or total joint replacement. Recently, both reparative and restorative procedures have been developed to address this significant source of morbidity in young active patients. Microfracture is a reparative technique that induces a healing response to occur in an area of articular cartilage damage. Osteochondral autografts and allografts in addition to autologous chondrocyte implantation are restorative techniques aimed at recreating a more normal articular surface. Both types of procedures have been developed to alleviate the symptoms associated with focal chondral defects, as well as limit their potential to progress to a diffuse degenerative arthritis. Treatment can vary depending on both cartilage defect and patient factors. This article summarizes the various treatment options that have recently become available.",0

The best way to face the challenge is to develop a biomimetic construct to mimic the multilayered gradient from cartilage, to calcified cartilage and subchondral bone. In this study, bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) were cultured on electrospun fibrous meshes and cell sheets were incubated. The fibrous meshes were composed of 50% poly(L-lactide) and 50% gelatin, displaying excellent biocompatibility, cell affinity and degradability. Differentiation of BMSC sheets on fibrous meshes was induced chondrogenically or osteogenically. In particular, the BMSC sheets were able to be efficiently induced differentiating towards calcified cartilage by using a 1:1 (v/v) mixed medium of chondrogenic and osteogenic inductive media. Thus, a gradient 3D construct was built by stacking the differently pre-differentiated cell/mesh complexes layer by layer from top to bottom to mimic the cartilage-to-bone transition. With this gradient construct being implanted in the rabbit knee osteochondral defect, it was confirmed that it could promote the tissue regeneration with intact cartilage layer formation in comparison with the multilayered construct without a gradient. The strategy of using properly pre-differentiated BMSC sheet on fibrous mesh to build the osteochondral interface was thus suggested as being feasible and effective in mimicking its hierarchical complexity, and favored the repairing of injured joint cartilage.",0

Cell-based therapies represent an appealing alternative strategy for cartilage regeneration, and interesting results have been recently reported after intra-articular injections of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The results of hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and intra-articular injections of autologous expanded bone marrow - MSCs (BM-MSCs) are reported in this retrospective study.Twenty patients (29 hips) received hip arthroscopy for FAI and focal cartilage injuries or mild to moderate osteoarthrosis (OA). Three intra-articular injections of 20×106 BM-MSCs were injected from 4 to 6 weeks postoperative. The modified Harris Hip score (mHHS), the WOMAC score, the VAIL score and VAS score were administered to all patients.The mean age of the patients was 51.8 years, and the mean follow-up was 24 months. The median preoperative mHHS, WOMAC and VAIL scores were 64.3, 73 and 56.5 respectively, and they increased to 91, 97 and 83 at final follow up (p<0.05). The VAS score also improved from a median of 6 to 2. Four patients received a THA (13% of the hips) at the median of 9 months post intervention (range 6-36 months). Six patients referred pain after the injection of MSCs, which improved with oral pain killers. No major complications were reported.BM-MSCc injections in combination with hip arthroscopy may improve the quality of life and functional score in patient with FAI and cartilage injuries which are still not candidate to a THA.IV case series.",0

Results indicate repair tissue to be on average 2.5 mm thick. It was of varying morphology ranging from predominantly hyaline in 22% of biopsy specimens, mixed in 48%, through to predominantly fibrocartilage, in 30%, apparently improving with increasing time postgraft. Repair tissue was well integrated with the host tissue in all aspects viewed. MRI scans provide a useful assessment of properties of the whole graft area and adjacent tissue and is a noninvasive technique for long-term follow-up.

The majority of these lesions are associated with ankle sprains and fractures though several nontraumatic etiologies have also been recognized. Patients normally present with a history of prior ankle injury and/or instability. In addition to standard ankle radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography are used to characterize the extent of the lesion and involvement of the subchondral bone. Symptomatic nondisplaced lesions can often be treated conservatively within the pediatric population though this treatment is less successful in adults. Bone marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture have yielded favorable results for the treatment of small (&lt;15 mm) lesions. Osteochondral autograft can be harvested most commonly from the ipsilateral knee and carries the benefit of repairing defects with native hyaline cartilage. Osteochondral allograft transplant is reserved for large cystic lesions that lack subchondral bone integrity. Cell-based repair techniques such as autologous chondrocyte implantation and matrix-associated chondrocyte implantation have been increasingly used in an attempt to repair the lesion with hyaline cartilage though these techniques require adequate subchondral bone. Biological agents such as platelet-rich plasma and bone marrow aspirate have been more recently studied as an adjunct to operative treatment but their use remains theoretical. The present article reviews the current concepts in the evaluation and management of osteochondral lesions of the talus, with a focus on the available surgical treatment options.",0

To this aim, we tested microspheres releasing TGFβ3 (PAM-T) in vitro and in situ, in a pathological osteoarthritic (OA) environment. We first evaluated the chondrogenic differentiation of human MSCs seeded onto PAM-T in vitro and confirmed the up-regulation of chondrogenic markers while the secretome of the cells was not changed by the 3D environment. We then injected human MSC seeded onto PAM-T in the knee joints of mice with collagenase-induced OA. After 6 weeks, histological analysis revealed that formation of a cartilage-like tissue occurred at the vicinity of PAM-T that was not observed when MSCs were seeded onto PAM. We also noticed that the endogenous articular cartilage was less degraded. The extent of cartilage protection was further analysed by confocal laser microscopy. When MSCs seeded onto PAM-T were injected early after OA induction, protection of cartilage against degradation was evidenced and this effect was associated to a higher survival of MSCs in presence of TGFβ3. This study points to the interest of using MSCs seeded onto PAM for cartilage repair and stimulation of endogenous cartilage regeneration.",0

Each of these problems must be addressed to achieve a successful outcome for any cartilage restoration procedure. If nonsurgical management fails, surgical treatment is largely based on the size and location of the cartilage defect. Preservation of the patient's native cartilage is preferred if an osteochondral fragment can be salvaged. Chondroplasty and osteochondral autograft transfer are typically used to treat small (<2 cm) cartilage defects. Microfracture has not been shown to be superior to chondroplasty alone and has potential adverse effects, including cyst and intralesional osteophyte formation. Osteochondral allograft transfer and matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation are often used for larger cartilage defects. Particulated juvenile allograft cartilage is another treatment option for cartilage lesions that has good to excellent short-term results but long-term outcomes are lacking.",0

However, limited approaches have been made in developing therapies to decrease the detrimental effects of CI/R. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of penehyclidine hydrochloride (PHC) postconditioning on CI/R injury and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In CI/R rats, we showed that PHC postconditioning could effectively inhibit I/R-induced brain infarction and edema, and deficit of neurological function. In addition, PHC postconditioning significantly inhibited I/R-induced increase of proinflammatory cytokines and TUNEL-positive cell numbers. Moreover, the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and oxidative stress resulting from I/R were suppressed notably by PHC postconditioning, as evidenced by increased absorbance at 540 nm in Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling test and increased SOD activity and decreased ROS and MDA level. 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD), a specific inhibitor of MitoKATP, was used to evaluate the role of MitoKATP in the neuroprotective effect of PHC postconditioning. The results showed that 5-HD could markedly suppress PHC postconditioning-caused inhibition of brain infarction and edema, deficit of neurological function, inflammation, apoptosis, opening of mPTP and oxidative stress induced by CI/R. The results demonstrated that PHC postconditioning could protect against I/R injury in brain through the inhibition of oxidative stress, mPTP opening, apoptosis and inflammation. Activation of MitoKATP was critical for PHC postconditioning-exhibited neuro-protective effects against I/R injury. These findings may provide a novel foundation for therapeutic strategies targeting cerebral protection against I/R damage.",0

Insulin-like growth factor-I facilitates chondrogenesis of bone marrow-derived stem cells in long-term culture and may enhance chondrogenesis in healing cartilage lesions in vivo. This study examined the impact of insulin-like growth factor-I, gradually released from fibrin clots polymerized in situ, on the recruitable stem-cell pool in a full-thickness critical cartilage defect model. Twelve full-thickness 15-mm cartilage lesions in the femoropatellar articulations of six young mature horses were repaired by an injection of autogenous fibrin containing 25 microg of human recombinant insulin-like growth factor-I or, in control joints, fibrin without the growth factor. All horses were killed at 6 months, and cartilage repair tissue and surrounding cartilage were assessed by histology, histochemistry, types I and II collagen immunohistochemistry, types I and II collagen in situ hybridization, and matrix biochemical determinations. White tissue filled grafted and control lesions, with the growth factor-treated defects being more completely filled and securely attached to the subchondral bone. A moderately improved chondrocyte population, more columnar cellular organization, and better attachment to the underlying bone were evident on histological evaluation of growth factor-treated defects. Type-II procollagen mRNA was abundantly present in the deeper half of the treated sections compared with moderate message expression in control tissues. Immunolocalization of type-II collagen showed a preponderance of the collagen in growth factor-treated lesions, confirming translation of type-II message to protein. Composite histologic healing scores for treated defects were significantly improved over those for control defects. DNA content in the cartilage defects was similar in treated and control joints. Matrix proteoglycan content was similar in treated and control defects and lower in the defects than in the intact surrounding and remote cartilage of the treated and control joints. The proportion of type-II collagen significantly increased in growth factor-treated tissues. Fibrin polymers laden with insulin-like growth factor-I improved the histologic appearance and the proportion of type-II collagen in healing, full-thickness cartilage lesions. However, none of the biochemical or morphologic features were consistent with those of normal articular cartilage.",0

The challenge of translating initial successes in small laboratory animals into the clinics involves pilot studies in large animal models, where safety and efficacy should be investigated during prolonged follow-up periods. Here we present, in a single study, the long-term (up to 1 year) effect of biocompatible porous scaffolds non-seeded and seeded with fresh ex vivo expanded autologous progenitor cells that were derived from three different cell sources [cartilage, fat and bone marrow (BM)] in order to evaluate their advantages as cartilage resurfacing agents. An ovine model of critical size osteochondral focal defect was used and the test items were implanted arthroscopically into the knees. Evidence of regeneration of hyaline quality tissue was observed at 6 and 12 months post-treatment with variable success depending on the cell source. Cartilage and BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), but not those derived from fat, resulted in the best quality of new cartilage, as judged qualitatively by magnetic resonance imaging and macroscopic assessment, and by histological quantitative scores. Given the limitations in sourcing cartilage tissue and the risk of donor site morbidity, BM emerges as a preferential source of MSC for novel cartilage resurfacing therapies of osteochondral defects using copolymeric poly-D,L-lactide-co-glycolide scaffolds.",0

The purpose of this study was to review the short- to midterm outcomes of our patients who were treated with OAT harvesting from ipsilateral talar articular facets for OLTs. Methods Between December 2010 and November 2018, 24 patients were enrolled in this study. There were 16 males and eight females with an average age of 39.1 years and a follow-up period of 50.9 months. The clinical results were evaluated according to the American Orthopedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score and the visual analogue scale (VAS) score. Pre-operative plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, post-operative radiographs, and X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans at the last follow-up were observed. Results There was a significant improvement in the AOFAS score from 61.3 +/- 19.0 pre-operatively to 84.9 +/- 9.2 post-operatively (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001). The VAS score improved from 6.1 +/- 2.3 to 2.0 +/- 1.4 at the last follow-up (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001). Twenty-one patients (87.5%) were satisfied with their clinical results. By the last follow-up CT scan, there was bone cyst formation at the donor sites in three patients, at the recipient sites in five patients and at both sites in five patients. Two patients (8.3%) underwent re-operation with arthroscopic debridement because of medial gutter hypertrophic soft tissue impingement. Conclusion OAT harvesting from the ipsilateral talar articular facet showed satisfactory results. The mean post-operative VAS score and AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score improved significantly. Post-operative impingement around the osteotomy site was the main complication and reason for re-operation after the index procedure. In addition, bone cysts at the recipient and/or donor site(s) were found with a large percentage under CT. Therefore, longer follow-up is necessary to determine the long-term clinical results for this technique.",0

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promising results in OA, but their mechanism of action is not fully understood. We hypothesize that MSCs polarize macrophages, which are strongly associated with joint inflammation to more homeostatic sub-types. We tracked ferumoxytol (Feraheme™, iron oxide nanoparticle)-labeled murine MSCs (Fe-MSCs) in murine OA joints, and quantified changes to joint inflammation and fibrosis. 10-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (n = 5/group) were induced to undergo osteoarthritis by destabilization of medical meniscus (DMM) or sham surgery. 3 weeks post-surgery, mice were injected intra-articularly with either fluorescent dye-(DiR) labeled or DiR-Fe-MSC or saline to yield 4 groups (n = 5 per group for each timepoint [1, 2 and 4weeks]). 4 weeks after injection, mice were imaged by MRI, and scored for i) OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) to determine cartilage damage; ii) immunohistochemical changes in iNOS, CD206, F4/80 and Prussian Blue/Sca-1 to detect pro-inflammatory, homeostatic and total macrophages and ferumoxytol -labeled MSCs respectively, and iii) Masson's Trichrome to detect changes in fibrosis. Ferumoxytol-labeled MSCs persisted at greater levels in DMM vs. SHAM-knee joints. We observed no difference in OARSI scores between MSC and vehicle groups. Sca-1 and Prussian Blue co-staining confirmed the ferumoxytol label resides in MSCs, although some ferumoxytol label was detected in proximity to MSCs in macrophages, likely due to phagocytosis of apoptotic MSCs, increasing functionality of these macrophages through MSC efferocytosis. MRI hypertintensity scores related to fluid edema decreased in MSC-treated vs. control animals. For the first time, we show that MSC-treated mice had increased ratios of %CD206+: %F4/80+ (homeostatic macrophages) (p<0.05), and decreased ratios of %iNOS+: %F4/80+ macrophages (p<0.01), supporting our hypothesis that MSCs may modulate synovial inflammation.",0

It has been proposed that failure of subchondral bone maintenance or restoration is a factor contributing to the failure of cartilage-forming transplants. Some studies reveal that the transplant is associated with subchondral bone resorption, often leading to deep pits beneath the presumptive cartilage repair site. Thus, the question is raised as to the utility of agents, such as bisphosphonates, to inhibit bone remodeling at the transplant site. In the present study we show that oral administration (three times weekly) of the bisphosphonate, risedronate, inhibited the subchondral bone loss deep to the cultured allogeneic graft tissue site in attempted repair of surgically created chondral defects in a minipig model. In addition, the graft tissue, characterized by type II collagen, was retained in the majority of treated animals. Untreated minipigs displayed a deep bone resorption pit, beneath the graft region, filled with type I collagen tissue as determined through immunohistochemical staining. This fibrous tissue appeared well integrated with the host tissue in the majority of cases. In the transplanted cartilage region, the overall histological score for tissue quality was significantly (p < 0.05) better for the treated animals which displayed better matrix staining, cell clustering, tidemark integrity, and subchondral bone integrity (p < 0.05 in each category). However, the integration of allograft with host tissue did not always occur completely. Thus, bisphosphonates might be considered in clinical treatment strategies for such procedures.",0

Storage temperature and nutrient medium composition are the most critical factors for sustained biological activity of grafts before implantation. In this study, we performed a time-dependent in vitro experiment to investigate the effect of various storage conditions on electromechanical, histological and histochemical properties of articular cartilage.Osteochondral grafts derived from goat femoral condyles were frozen at -70 °C or stored at 4 °C and 37 °C in the medium supplemented with or without insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). After 14 and 28 days the cartilage samples were quantitatively analysed for electromechanical properties, glycosaminoglycan distribution, histological structure, chondrocyte viability and apoptosis. The results were compared between the experimental groups and correlations among different evaluation methods were determined.Storage at -70 °C and 37 °C significantly deteriorated cartilage electromechanical, histological and histochemical properties. Storage at 4 °C maintained the electromechanical quantitative parameter (QP) and glycosaminoglycan expression near the normal levels for 14 days. Although hypothermic storage revealed reduced chondrocyte viability and increased apoptosis, these parameters were superior compared with the storage at -70 °C and 37 °C. IGF-1 supplementation improved the electromechanical QP, chondrocyte viability and histological properties at 37 °C, but the effect lasted only 14 days. Electromechanical properties correlated with the histological grading score (r = 0.673, p < 0.001), chondrocyte viability (r = -0.654, p < 0.001) and apoptosis (r = 0.416, p < 0.02). In addition, apoptosis correlated with glycosaminoglycan distribution (r = -0.644, p < 0.001) and the histological grading score (r = 0.493, p = 0.006).Our results indicate that quality of allografts is better preserved at currently established 4 °C storage temperature. Storage at -70 °C or at 37 °C is unable to maintain cartilage function and metabolic activity. IGF-1 supplementation at 37 °C can enhance chondrocyte viability and improve electromechanical and histological properties of the cartilage, but the impact persists only 14 days. The correlations between cartilage electromechanical quantitative parameter (QP) and metabolic activity were detected. Our findings indicate that non-destructive assessment of cartilage by Arthro-BST is a simple and reliable method to evaluate allograft quality, and could be routinely used before implantation.",0

However, the menisci have limited healing potential due to the paucity of vascularity . The purpose of the present study was to test the feasibility of a scaffold-free tissue-engineered construct (TEC) derived from synovial mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to repair incurable meniscal lesions. Porcine synovial MSCs were cultured in monolayers at high density in the presence of ascorbic acid followed by the suspension culture to develop a three-dimensional cell/matrix construct (TEC). A 4-mm cylindrical defect was created bilaterally in the medial meniscus of skeletally mature miniature pigs . The defects were implanted with an allogenic TEC or were left empty. After 6 months, the TEC-treated defects were consistently repaired by a fibro-cartilaginous tissue with good tissue integration to the adjacent host meniscal tissue, while the untreated were either partially or not repaired. The ratio of Safranin O positive area within the central body of the meniscus adjacent to the original defect was significantly higher in the TEC-treated group than in the control group. Moreover, TEC treatment significantly reduced the size and severity of post-traumatic chondral lesions on the tibial plateau. These results suggest that the TEC could be a promising stem cell-based implant to repair meniscal lesions with preventive effects from meniscal body degeneration and the development of post-traumatic arthritis.",0

An X-ray revealed osteochondritis dissecans of the lateral femoral condyle. Arthrotomy was performed and the fragment was fixated with tissue glue and 2 absorbable pins. Eight months later, a large recurrent osteochondral fragment of the lateral femoral condyle was seen on X-ray. The patient was re-operated, during which operation the fragment was found and fixated with three compression screws. One year after the first operation the patient developed similar complaints in the contralateral knee; this knee also contained osteochondral fragments necessitating surgery. Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee is a multifactorial disease in which part of the cartilage of the femoral condyle becomes unattached from the subchondral stratum, usually on the lateral side of the medial femoral condyle. Initially, an inflammatory reaction was thought to be the cause of osteochondritis dissecans. Because of the lack of white blood cells, a previous trauma is a better explanation for the ultimate loosening of the cartilage. The treatments that are described for osteochondritis dissecans are conservative treatment, operative fixation, with or without subsequent chondrocyte transplantation or osteochondral autograft transplantation, and finally microfracturing.",0

Microfracture, abrasion chondroplasty, osteochondral grafting, ACI, and autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis are distinguishable by cell source (including chondrocytes and stem cells) and associated scaffolds (natural or synthetic, hydrogels or membranes). ACI seems to be as good as, if not better than, microfracture for repairing large chondral defects in a young patient’s knee as evaluated by multiple clinical indices and the quality of regenerated tissue.

In all cases the cells showed the morphological appearance of mature chondrocytes, stained positively for alcian blue and safranin-O, and revealed a strong immunoreaction for S-100 protein, type II collagen, and chondroitin-S but not for type I collagen. Radioisotope assay of chondrocyte proliferation at 1, 10, and 20 days of culture revealed a progressive increase in [H-3]thymidine. incorporation. These findings indicate that the cells before autologous implantation maintain their differentiated phenotype of mature chondrocytes, and proliferate greatly. This analysis is an essential step preceding wider use of this treatment in humans. However, other biological aspects of the autologous, chondrocyte graft remain to be elucidated.",0

In the repair process, although underlying subchondral bone becomes necrotic and then is followed by bone reconstruction, the fate of graft and host cells during remodeling of underlying subchondral bone has not been elucidated. The objectives of this study were to establish a method to follow graft and host cells after transplantation of osteochondral autograft, and to elucidate the fate of both graft and host cells during remodeling of underlying subchondral bone. For these purposes, autologous transplantation models employing transgenic rats and wild-type rats, which were genetically identical to each other except for transgenes, were used. Two transplantation models were designed so that either the graft or the host cells had transgenes. Model I: transgenic rats were the donor, and wild-type rats were the recipient; model II: conversely, wild-type rats were the donor, and transgenic rats were the recipient. The grafted bone marrow cells and osteocytes in the trabeculae survived in the graft at 3 weeks after transplantation. Invasion of the host bone marrow cells into the graft was also found. Thus, bone marrow cells in the host as well as both bone marrow cells and osteocytes in the graft could potentially participate in the remodeling of underlying subchondral bone. Furthermore, the interface between graft and host was consisted with both graft and host derived cells. Since new bone formation was found in this space, both graft and host cells could have the potential to contribute to remodeling of underlying subchondral bone. The two models of the transplantations using the transgenic rats were found to be beneficial in following graft cells as well as host cells and in understanding their function on healing after autologous transplantation.",0

In symptomatic patients established methods of management rely on the formation of fibrocartilage which has poor resistance to shear forces. The formation of hyaline or hyaline-like cartilage may be induced by implanting autologous, cultured chondrocytes into the chondral or osteochondral defect. Autologous chondrocyte implantation may be used for full-thickness chondral or osteochondral injuries which are painful and debilitating with the aim of replacing damaged cartilage with hyaline or hyaline-like cartilage, leading to improved function. The intermediate and long-term functional and clinical results are promising. We provide a review of autologous chondrocyte implantation and describe our experience with the technique at our institution with a mean follow-up of 32 months (1 to 9 years). The procedure is shown to offer statistically significant improvement with advantages over other methods of management of chondral defects.",0

We have investigated the first case series of combined neutralising high tibial osteotomy (HTO) and Matrix-induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (MACI) with MRI. Treatment goals were clinical improvement and delay of arthroplasty.Between 2002 and 2005 18 patients (Mean age 47 years) underwent surgery. Exclusion criteria were lateral compartment and advanced patellofemoral OA. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), six minute walk test (6MWT) and a validated MRI score were outcome measures.There were significant improvements (p<0.05) in all five KOOS domains. Four were significantly maintained to 5 years. The domain ""symptoms"" and results in the 6MWT dropped off at 5 years. MRI results were first significantly improved (24/12) but declined at 60 months. Good quality infill was found in 33% patients at the study endpoint (n=5/15). Histological investigation of one knee demonstrated full-thickness hyaline-like cartilage (20/12). After 2 early failures and one graft detachment graft fixation was changed (Smart nails instead of sutures in 14 cases). Graft hypertrophy requiring a chondroplasty occurred once. There were no other major complications. Specific minor complications included patellar tendinitis (n=8).This combined procedure provides a safe treatment option for younger patients with medial knee OA and varus alignment with significant clinical improvement at 5 years. However, overall graft survival and cartilage infill were poor. Larger studies are needed to statistically verify predictors for longer term cartilage repair in these patients.",0

Recently, several techniques for resurfacing a cartilaginous lesion with hyaline cartilage have been developed and applied to osteochondritis dissecans lesions. In this review, we mainly focus on the development of surgical management for osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow over the past year. Recent findings The surgical strategy for osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum (capitellar osteochondritis dissecans) has tended to shift from marrow-stimulating techniques to autologous osteochondral grafts as a cartilage-resurfacing technique. Osteochondral grafts for capitellar osteochondritis dissecans provide better outcomes than simple excision. Regarding the postoperative morbidity of the donor knee, no adverse effect on the donor site is found in young athletes with capitellar osteochondritis dissecans. Additionally, arthroscopic surgery for osteochondritis dissecans lesions has been expanded as well as for other elbow disorders. However, there has been no evidence that arthroscopic surgery for osteochondritis dissecans lesions results in any better prognosis for the patient. Summary The goal of treatment for capitellar osteochondritis dissecans is to return patients to their previous level of sport activities and to regenerate long-lasting hyaline cartilage tissue to replace cartilaginous lesions. For this treatment goal, an arthroscopic cartilage-resurfacing procedure may be an ideal treatment for capitellar osteochondritis dissecans.",0

To overcome this problem, various techniques have been developed and widely used, but the cost-effectiveness and resulting tissue regeneration have never achieved hyaline-like cartilage that has the best biomechanical properties. The idea of this experiment is to use a Biodegradable Porous Sponge Cartilage (BPSC) Scaffold to enhance the regeneration of hyaline-like cartilage combined with microfracture technique and Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ASCs) or secretome on an animal model. Methods A model defect was made on the femoral trochlea of a New Zealand white rabbit. Four groups were made to compare different treatment methods for osteochondral defects. The groups were: (1) Control group; (2) Scaffold Group; (3) Scaffold + ASCs Group; (4) Scaffold + Secretome Group. After 12 weeks, we terminate the animal models, then a macroscopic evaluation using the International Cartilage Research Society (ICRS) scoring system and Oswestry Arthroscopy Score (OAS) was done, followed by sectioning the specimen for microscopic evaluation using the O’Driscoll scoring system. Results The mean score for all treatment group were better compared to the control group grossly and histologically. The best mean score for macroscopic and microscopic evaluation was the group given Scaffold + ASCs. Conclusion The application of BPSC scaffold enhances cartilage regeneration in larger osteochondral defects. Furthermore, the addition of ASCs or secretome along with the scaffold implantation further enhances the cartilage regeneration, in which ASCs shows better results.",0

Rational or irrational?].,"Ankle sprains are one the most common injuries of the lower limb. Fractures, ligamentous lesions, and cartilaginous damage are often associated. Nevertheless the injury is often misjudged and concomitant chondral lesions are assessed late. In the case of a symptomatic osteocartilaginous lesion of the talus, which can be illustrated by MRI or X-ray, operative intervention is indicated. Methods such as microfracturing, mosaicplasty, and autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) are in clinical use. The latter is well known and being established as the treatment of choice for large cartilage defects in the knee. Due to the good results in the knee and the technological improvements (three-dimensional tissue constructs seeded with autologous chondrocytes) this method is being increasingly applied for cartilage lesions of the talus. In contrast to the mosaicplasty donor site morbidity is low and the size of the defect is not a limiting factor. The current studies about ACT of the talus show a stable repair of the defect with mostly hyaline-like cartilage and high patient satisfaction. Therefore, the procedure can be recommended for lesions\textbackslashtextgreater1 cm2. Concomitant treatment of posttraumatic deformities (malalignment), ligamentous instabilities, and especially the reconstruction of bony defects are compulsory.",0

They can recreate mechanical and biological characteristics of native articular cartilage and promote cartilage regeneration in combination with mesenchymal stromal cells. One of the limitations of in vivo models for testing the outcome of tissue engineering approaches is implant fixation. The high mechanical stress within the knee joint, as well as the concave and convex cartilage surfaces, makes fixation of reinforced hydrogel challenging. Methods. Different fixation methods for full-thickness chondral defects in minipigs such as fibrin glue, BioGlue®, covering, and direct suturing of nonenforced and enforced constructs were compared. Because of insufficient fixation in chondral defects, superficial osteochondral defects in the femoral trochlea, as well as the femoral condyle, were examined using press-fit fixation. Two different hydrogels (starPEG and PAGE) were compared by 3D-micro-CT (μCT) analysis as well as histological analysis. Results. Our results showed fixation of below 50% for all methods in chondral defects. A superficial osteochondral defect of 1 mm depth was necessary for long-term fixation of a polycaprolactone (PCL)-reinforced hydrogel construct. Press-fit fixation seems to be adapted for a reliable fixation of 95% without confounding effects of glue or suture material. Despite the good integration of our constructs, especially in the starPEG group, visible bone lysis was detected in micro-CT analysis. There was no significant difference between the two hydrogels (starPEG and PAGE) and empty control defects regarding regeneration tissue and cell integration. However, in the starPEG group, more cell-containing hydrogel fragments were found within the defect area. Conclusion. Press-fit fixation in a superficial osteochondral defect in the medial trochlear groove of adult minipigs is a promising fixation method for reinforced hydrogels. To avoid bone lysis, future approaches should focus on multilayered constructs recreating the zonal cartilage as well as the calcified cartilage and the subchondral bone plate.",0

Surgical treatment paradigms aim to restore the articular surface with a repair tissue similar to native cartilage and to provide long-term symptomatic relief.➤ Arthroscopic bone-marrow stimulation techniques, such as microfracture and drilling, perforate the subchondral plate with multiple openings to recruit mesenchymal stem cells from the underlying bone marrow to stimulate the differentiation of fibrocartilaginous repair tissue in the defect site. The ability of fibrocartilage to withstand mechanical loading and protect the subchondral bone over time is a concern.➤ Autologous osteochondral transplantation techniques replace the defect with a tubular unit of viable hyaline cartilage and bone from a donor site in the ipsilateral knee. In rare cases, a graft can also be harvested from the ipsilateral talus or contralateral knee. The limitations of donor site morbidity and the potential need for an osteotomy about the ankle should be considered. Some anterior or far posterior talar lesions can be accessed without arthrotomy or with a plafondplasty.➤ Osteochondral allograft transplantation allows an osteochondral lesion with a large surface area to be replaced with a single unit of viable articular cartilage and subchondral bone from a donor that is matched to size, shape, and surface curvature. The best available evidence suggests that this procedure should be limited to large-volume cystic lesions or salvage procedures.➤ Autologous chondrocyte implantation techniques require a two-stage procedure, the first for chondrocyte harvest and the second for implantation in a periosteum-covered or matrix-induced form after in vivo culture expansion. Theoretically, the transplantation of chondrocyte-like cells into the defect will result in hyaline-like repair tissue.",0

The ability of human Dental Pulp Stem Cells (DPSCs) to differentiate into chondroblasts in vitro suggests that this stem cell type may be useful for tissue bioengineering. However, we have yet to identify a study of large animal models in which DPSCs were used to repair articular cartilage. Therefore, this study aimed to describe a novel treatment for cartilage lesion with DPSCs on a large animal model.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were obtained from deciduous teeth and characterized by flow cytometry. DPSCs were cultured and added to a collagen type I/III biomaterial composite scaffold. Brazilian miniature pig (BR-1) was used. A 6-mm diameter, full-thickness chondral defect was created in each posterior medial condyle. The defects were covered with scaffold alone or scaffold + DPSCs on the contralateral side. Animals were euthanized 6 weeks post-surgery. Cartilage defects were analyzed macroscopically and histology according to modified O'Driscoll scoring system.Flow cytometry confirmed characterization of DPSCs as MSCs. Macroscopic and histological findings suggested that this time period was reasonable for evaluating cartilage repair. To our knowledge, this study provides the first description of an animal model using DPSCs to study the differentiation of hyaline articular cartilage in vivo.The animals tolerated the procedure well and did not show clinical or histological rejection of the DPSCs, reinforcing the feasibility of this descriptive miniature pig model for pre-clinical studies.",0

Autologous chondrocyte implantation, a first-generation cell therapy, uses suspended autologous cultured chondrocytes in combination with a periosteal patch. Collagen-covered autologous cultured chondrocyte implantation, a second-generation cell therapy, uses suspended cultured chondrocytes with a collagen type I/III membrane. Today's demand for transarthroscopic procedures has resulted in the development of third-generation cell therapies that deliver autologous cultured chondrocytes using cell carriers or cell-seeded scaffolds.To review the current evidence of the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation procedure, the most widely used carrier system to date. Also discussed are the characteristics of type I/III collagen membranes, behavior of cells associated with the membrane, surgical technique, rehabilitation, clinical outcomes, and quality of repair tissue.Systematic review.Relevant publications were identified by searching Medline from its inception (1949) to December 2007; peer-reviewed publications of preclinical and clinical cell behavior, manufacturing process, surgical technique, and rehabilitation protocols were identified. Preclinical and clinical studies were included if they contained primary data and used a type I/III collagen membrane.Data from these studies demonstrate that patients treated with matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation have an overall improvement in clinical outcomes. Reduced visual analog scale pain levels (range, 1.7-5.32 points) and improvements in the modified Cincinnati (range, 3.8-34.2 points), Lysholm-Gillquist (range, 23.09-47.6 points), Tegner-Lysholm (range, 1.39-3.9 points), and International Knee Documentation Classification scale (P <.05) were observed. Patients had good-quality (hyaline-like) repair tissue as assessed by arthroscopic evaluation (including International Cartilage Repair Society score), magnetic resonance imaging, and histology, as well as a low incidence of postoperative complications.The findings suggest that matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation is a promising third-generation cell therapy for the repair of symptomatic, full-thickness articular cartilage defects.",0

Treatment consisted of surgical implantation of an autologous-based matrix of hyaline cartilage chips combined with a clot of plasma poor in platelets and intraarticular injection of plasma rich in growth factors. Outcome measures at 1, 3 and 6months included macroscopic International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score, histological and immunohistochemical analysis for collagen expression, and transmission electron microscopy study.ResultsThe 6-month macroscopic evaluation showed nearly normal (11.10.7) cartilage repair assessment. The ICRS score was significantly higher at 6months compared to 3months (5.5 +/- 1.3; p\textbackslashtextless0.0001) and 1 (1.1 +/- 0.4; p\textbackslashtextless0.0001) month. At 6months, hyaline cartilage tissue filling the defect was observed with adequate integration of the regenerated cartilage at the surrounding healthy cartilage margin. At 6months, mature chondrons and cartilage matrix contained collagen fibers with masked fibrillary structure, and the expression of collagen in the newly formed cartilage was similar in intensity and distribution pattern compared to the healthy adjacent cartilage.Conclusions This novel treatment enhanced chondrogenesis and regenerated hyaline cartilage at 6 months with nearly normal macroscopic ICRS assessment. Histological analysis showed equivalent structure to mature cartilage tissue in the defect and a collagen expression pattern in the newly formed cartilage similar to that found in adjacent healthy articular cartilage. The present technique may have clinical application for chondral injuries in humans because this procedure is cheap (no need for allograft, or expensive instrumentation/biomaterials/techniques), easy and fast-performing through a small arthrotomy, and safe (no rejection possibility because the patients' own tissue, cells, and plasma are used).",0

Osteochondral knee lesions occur in either traumatic lesions or in osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). These lesions can involve all the articular surfaces of the knee in its three compartments. In principle, this review article covers symptomatic ICRS grade C or D lesions, depth III and IV, excluding management of superficial lesions, asymptomatic lesions that are often discovered unexpectedly, and kissing lesions, which arise prior to or during osteoarthritis. For clarity sake, the international classifications used are reviewed, for both functional assessment (ICRS and functional IKDC for osteochondral fractures, Hughston for osteochondritis) and morphological lesion evaluations (the ICRS macroscopic evaluation for fractures, the Bedouelle or SOFCOT for osteochondritis, and MOCART for MRI). The therapeutic armamentarium to treat these lesions is vast, but accessibility varies greatly depending on the country and the legislation in effect. Many comparative studies have been conducted, but they are rarely of high scientific quality; the center effect is nearly constant because patients are often referred to certain centers for an expert opinion. The indications defined herein use algorithms that take into account the size of the cartilage defect and the patient's functional needs for cases of fracture and the vitality, stability, and size of the fragment for cases of osteochondritis dissecans. Fractures measuring less than 2 cm(2) are treated with either microfracturing or mosaic osteochondral grafting, between 2 and 4 cm(2) with microfractures covered with a membrane or a culture of second- or third-generation chondrocytes, and beyond this size, giant lesions are subject to an exceptional allografting procedure, harvesting from the posterior condyle, or chondrocyte culture on a 3D matrix to restore volume. Cases of stable osteochondritis dissecans with closed articular cartilage can be simply monitored or treated with perforation in cases of questionable vitality. Cases of open joint cartilage are treated with a PLUS fixation if their vitality is preserved; if not, they are treated comparably to osteochondral fractures, with the type of filling depending on the defect size.",0

A new multilayer gradient nano-composite scaffold was obtained by nucleating collagen fibrils with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. In the femoral condyles of 12 sheep, 24 osteochondral lesions were created. Animals were randomized into three treatment groups: scaffold alone, scaffold colonized in vitro with autologous chondrocytes and empty defects. Six months after surgery, the animals were sacrificed and the lesions were histologically evaluated. Histologic and gross evaluation of specimens showed good integration of the chondral surface in all groups except for the control group. Significantly better bone regeneration was observed both in the group receiving the scaffold alone and in the group with scaffold loaded with autologous chondrocytes. No difference in cartilage surface reconstruction and osteochondral defect filling was noted between cell-seeded and cell-free groups. In the control group, no bone or cartilage defect healing occurred, and the defects were filled with fibrous tissue. Quantitative macroscopic and histological score evaluations confirmed the qualitative trends observed. The results of the present study showed that this novel osteochondral scaffold is safe and easy to use, and may represent a suitable matrix to direct and coordinate the process of bone and hyaline-like cartilage regeneration. The comparable regeneration process observed with or without autologous chondrocytes suggests that the main mode of action of the scaffold is based on the recruitment of local cells.",0

Repair for massive meniscal defect remains a challenge owing to a lack of cell kinetics for the menisci precursors in knee joint. The synovium plays pivotal roles during the natural course of meniscal healing and contains mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with high chondrogenic potential. Here, we investigated whether intra-articular injected synovium-MSCs enhanced meniscal regeneration in rat massive meniscal defect. To track the injected cells, we developed transgenic rats expressing dual luciferase (Luc) and LacZ. The cells derived from synovium of the rats demonstrated colony-forming ability and multipotentiality, both characteristics of MSCs. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that gene expression of meniscal cells was closer to that of synovium-MSCs than to that of bone marrow-MSCs. Two to 8 weeks after five million Luc/LacZ+ synovium-MSCs were injected into massive meniscectomized knee of wild-type rat, macroscopically, the menisci regenerated much better than it did in the control group. After 12 weeks, the regenerated menisci were LacZ positive, produced type 2 collagen, and showed meniscal features by transmission electron microscopy. In in-vivo luminescence analysis, photons increased in the meniscus-resected knee over a 3-day period, then decreased without detection in all other organs. LacZ gene derived from MSCs could not be detected in other organs except in synovium by real-time PCR. Synovium-MSCs injected into the massive meniscectomized knee adhered to the lesion, differentiated into meniscal cells directly, and promoted meniscal regeneration without mobilization to distant organs. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.",0

Donor site morbidity and interference with joint homeostasis should be considered when applying the autologous chondrocyte transplantation technique. The use of ectopically produced cartilage, derived from periosteum, might be a novel method to heal cartilage defects. Ectopic cartilage was produced by dissecting a piece of periosteum from the tibia of rabbits. After 14 days the reactive tissue at the dissection site was harvested and a graft was cored out and press-fit implanted in an osteochondral defect in the medial condyle of the femur with or without addition of hyaluronan. After 3 weeks and 3 months the repair reaction was evaluated by histology. Thionine- and collagen type II-stained sections were evaluated for graft viability, ingrowth of the graft, and joint surface repair. Empty defects remained empty 3 weeks after implantation, ectopic cartilage filled the defect to the level of the surrounding cartilage. Histologically, the grafts were viable, consisting mainly of cartilage, and showed a variable pattern of ingrowth. Three months after implantation empty defects with or without hyaluronan were filled primarily with fibrocartilaginous tissue. Defects treated with ectopic cartilage contained mixtures of fibrocartilaginous and hyaline cartilage. Sometimes a tidemark was observed in the new articular cartilage and the orientation of the cells resembled that of healthy articular cartilage. Subchondral bone repair was excellent. The modified O'Driscoll scores for empty defects without and with hyaluronan were 12.7 +/- 6.4 and 15.3 +/- 3.2; for treated defects scores were better (15.4 +/- 3.9 and 18.2 +/- 2.9).

In the present study, BMMSCs or CTGF-modified BMMSCs seeded on PLGA or NaOH-treated PLGA scaffolds were incubated in vitro and NaOH-treated PLGA significantly stimulated proliferation of BMMSCs, while CTGF gene transfer promoted chondrogenic differentiation. The effects of the composite on the repair of cartilage defects were evaluated in rabbit knee joints in vivo. Full-thickness cartilage defects (diameter: 5 mm; depth: 3 mm) were created unilaterally in the patellar groove. Defects were either left empty ( n = 18) or implanted with BMMSCs/ PLGA ( n = 18), BMMSCs/NaOH-treated PLGA ( n = 18), or CTGF-modified BMMSCs/NaOH-treated PLGA ( n = 18). The defect area was examined grossly, histologically, and mechanically at 6, 12, and 24 weeks post-operatively. Implanted cells were tracked using adeno-LacZ labeling at 6 weeks after implantation. Overall, the CTGF-modified BMMSCs/NaOH-treated PLGA group showed successful hyaline-like cartilage regeneration similar to normal cartilage, which was superior to the other groups using gross examination, qualitative and quantitative histology, and mechanical assessment. The in vivo viability of the implanted cells was demonstrated by their retention for 6 weeks after implantation. These findings suggested that a combination of CTGF-modified BMMSCs and NaOH-treated PLGA may be an alternative treatment for large osteochondral defects in high-loading sites.",0

An arthroscopic repair technique that transplants chondral osseous replacement plugs to fill the defect (the COR technique; Mitek Products, Westwood, MA) offers an immediate solution for these lesions. The purpose of this study was to review the clinical and radiographic results of femoral chondral osseous replacement for full-thickness articular cartilage lesions between 2.5 and 1.0 cm in diameter.Case series.A retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients from 2 centers treated for full-thickness femoral articular cartilage lesions using a chondral osseous autograft transplantation technique was performed. All knees were evaluated both preoperatively and postoperatively by physical examination, radiographs, and Lysholm and Tegner knee scores. Inclusion criteria were full-thickness femoral condyle defects greater than 1 cm and less than 2.5 cm in diameter, and a minimum 24-month follow-up. Exclusion criteria were associated tibial defects, patellar defects, or generalized arthritic change. Grafts harvested from the superior, lateral femoral notch were press-fit into drilled holes to fill the femoral defects.Thirty-six patients met the inclusion criteria with an average follow-up of 48 months (range, 24 to 89 months). Their average age was 43 years and there were 20 men and 16 women. The medial femoral condyle was involved in 27 cases and the lateral femoral condyle in 9. The average Lysholm score increased from 44 preoperatively to 84 at follow-up. The average Tegner score at follow-up was 5. Repeat arthroscopy was performed in 14 patients and showed good incorporation of the grafts in all cases. Radiographic examinations revealed no arthritic changes at follow-up.This technique successfully transplants chondral osseous grafts within the knee that remain viable. No radiographic arthritic changes were observed and the midterm clinical result was favorable for these patients. Further investigation of the long-term results is required.Level 4, no or historical control.",0

Therefore, strategies to promote meniscus repair and improve meniscus function are needed. The objective of this study was to generate porcine meniscus-derived matrix (MDM) scaffolds and test their effectiveness in promoting meniscus repair via migration of endogenous meniscus cells from the surrounding meniscus or exogenously seeded human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Both endogenous meniscal cells and MSCs infiltrated the MDM scaffolds. In the absence of exogenous cells, the 8% MDM scaffolds promoted the integrative repair of an in vitro meniscal defect. Dehydrothermal crosslinking and concentration of the MDM influenced the biochemical content and shear strength of repair, demonstrating that the MDM can be tailored to promote tissue repair. These findings indicate that native meniscus cells can enhance meniscus healing if a scaffold is provided that promotes cellular infiltration and tissue growth. The high affinity of cells for the MDM and the ability to remodel the scaffold reveals the potential of MDM to integrate with native meniscal tissue to promote long-term repair without necessarily requiring exogenous cells.",0

These defects comprise injuries in both the articular cartilage and the subchondral bone. Due to the limited regeneration ability of articular cartilage, this kind of defects is normally irreparable and would gradually deteriorate toward osteoarthritis which requires surgical intervention. The current clinical treatments for osteochondral defects, such as total joint replacement and osteochondral autograft transplantation, are not ideal long-term solutions for this problem. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine provides a possible and prospective curative strategy for this clinical hinder. Nevertheless, In order to successfully solve this problem, there are still many basic and critical questions must be answered. These include the optimization on scaffold’s composition and structure, selection of suitable cell source, modulation of primary/stem cell fate or engineered osteochondral tissue, incorporation of bioactive factors, and spatial regeneration of the chondral layer, subchondral layers and the interface. Biomimetic strategy has been employed to explore these fields and exciting progresses have been achieved. This chapter summarizes these interesting advances of the pre-clinical studies on engineering of osteochondral tissue in the last 5 years. Special attentions were given to the development of biomimetic layered scaffolds with dependences on composition, cell source, or bioactive factors. In addition, cell fate regulation, external stimuli and interface regeneration were discussed. New insights and promising directions for the future study in osteochondral regeneration were also provided.",0

In the present study, tissue-engineered two-phase composite material was used for the repair of osteochondral defects in young adult rabbit knee. This composite material is composed of an injectable calcium phosphate (ICP) and a hyaluronan (HA) derivate of either ACP or HYAFF 11 sponge. The osteochondral defect, 3 mm in diameter and 3 mm deep, was created in the weight-bearing region of the medial femoral condyle. The bone portion of the defect was first filled with ICP to a level approximately 1 mm below the articular surface. HA sponge (3 mm in diameter and 1-1.2 mm thick), with or without loading of autologous bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (MPCs), was then inserted into the defect on top of the ICP as it hardened. Animals were allowed free cage activity postoperatively, and killed 4 or 12 weeks (for the HYAFF 11 sponge group) after the surgery. At 4 weeks, histological examination showed that the defect was filled up to 90-100% of its depth. Whitish repair tissue on the top appeared to be integrated with the surrounding articular cartilage. Four distinct zones of repair tissue were identified: a superficial layer, a chondroid tissue layer, an interface between HA sponge and ICP, and the ICP material. Evidence of extensive osteoclastic and osteoblastic activities was observed in the bone tissue surrounding the defect edge and in ICP material. By 12 weeks, the zonal features of the repair tissue became more distinct; chondrocytes were arranged in a columnar array, and a calcified layer of cartilage was formed beneath the chondroid tissue in some specimens. The healing tissue of the HA sponge material loaded with MPCs had higher cellular density and better integration with the surrounding cartilage than HA sponge material not loaded with MPCs. This study suggests that using a two-phase composite graft may hold potential for the repair of osteochondral defects by providing mechanical support that mimicks subchondral bone, while also providing a chondrogenic scaffold for the top cartilage repair.",0

The knee is most commonly involved, and without repair, patients have chronic knee pain, loose bodies, and early-onset osteoarthritis. There are a number of surgical techniques for repairing OCD, some of which are still being refined. Currently, common procedures used to treat OCD lesions include microfracture, autologous chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral autograft transplantation, and osteochondral allograft transplantation. In this Technical Note, we describe osteochondral allograft transplantation with the addition of platelet-rich plasma and graft-recipient microfracture. We believe the micropores augment the osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties of the allograft and aid in the incorporation of the allograft plug by improving angiogenesis, enhancing clot formation in the allograft, and providing a homogeneous environment for remodeling.",0

We created defects at the femoral condyle and implanted either scaffold A or B with chondrocytes or cell free. After 6 wk, animals were euthanized, we explanted the condyles, and evaluated them using histological, immunohistochemical, molecular biological, and histomorphometrical methods.Specimens with scaffold A showed severe lowering of the surface, and the defect size was larger than for scaffold B. We found more immune-competent cells around scaffold A. Chondrocytes were scarcely detected on the surface of both scaffolds. Histomorphometry of the interface between scaffold and recipient showed no significant difference regarding tissue of chondral, osseous, fibrous or implant origin or tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed significant up-regulation for collagen II and SOX-9 messenger ribonucleic acid expression on the surface of scaffold B compared with scaffold A.Scaffold B proved to be stable and sufficiently integrated in the short term compared with scaffold A. More extensive evaluations with scaffold B appear to be expedient.",0

A strong correlation exists between the amount and location of the resected meniscus and the development of degenerative changes in the knee. On the other hand, osteoarthritic changes of the joint alter the structural and functional integrity of meniscal tissue. These alterations might additionally compromise the limited healing capacity of the meniscus. In young, active patients without cartilage damage, meniscus therapy including partial meniscectomy, meniscus suture, and meniscus replacement has proven beneficial effects in long-term studies. Even in an early osteoarthritic milieu, there is a relevant regenerative potential of the meniscus and the surrounding cartilage. This potential should be taken into account, and meniscal surgery can be performed with the correct timing and the proper indication even in the presence of early OA. Level of evidence IV.",0

A small subset of these patients require a 2-stage revision ACL reconstruction because of tunnel osteolysis or tunnel malposition that will interfere with the planned revision tunnel placement3. In the present article, we describe the hybrid use of arthroscopically delivered injectable allograft matrix in the femur and pre-shaped bone dowels in the tibia for the treatment of lower-extremity bone deficiencies.After induction of anesthesia, approximately 60 cc of bone marrow aspirate is harvested from the anterior iliac crest with use of sterile techniques and is processed to obtain bone marrow aspirate concentrate. Routine diagnostic knee arthroscopy is performed via the standard anterolateral and anteromedial portals. Any additional intra-articular pathology is addressed, followed by excision of the remnant graft material, removal of existing femoral hardware as needed, and exposure of the existing bone tunnels. The femoral tunnel is debrided arthroscopically, removing all soft-tissue remnants. The existing tibial tunnel is exposed via the previous anteromedial tibial incision when possible. Again, any existing tibial hardware is removed. The tibial tunnel is then prepared with use of a combination of sequential reaming and dilation. A shaver and curets are utilized to debride the sclerotic walls of the tunnel and remove the remnant graft material. A cannulated allograft bone dowel is then impacted into place over a guidewire, ensuring that the graft is not proud within the joint space. An injectable bone allograft matrix composite is prepared by manually mixing 5 mL of StimuBlast demineralized bone matrix (Arthrex) and 5 mL of FlexiGraft cortical fibers (Arthrex), along with the previously obtained bone marrow aspirate concentrate. Under dry arthroscopy, this bone graft is delivered into the femoral tunnel via a cannula with use of the anteromedial portal. Finally, a Freer elevator is used to contour the graft at the aperture of the tunnel. Graft osteointegration is mandatory prior to proceeding with the second stage of the procedure. Typically, a minimum 3-month follow-up is necessary to confirm adequate graft incorporation on computed tomography.As an alternative to the 2-stage procedure, previous studies have suggested the use of a single-stage revision utilizing cylindrical allografts or multiple ""stacked screws.""4-6 In addition, a number of bone allograft and autograft options have been described. Autologous bone graft can be harvested from the ipsilateral iliac crest or proximal aspect of the tibia with use of a variety of techniques7-10. Allograft bone options include cancellous bone chips and commercially available bone matrices or dowels11-14. Finally, another viable option is calcium phosphate bone graft substitutes15. There is a paucity of high-quality studies comparing available bone graft materials for revision ACL reconstruction; thus, no consensus exists regarding the optimal choice16.A 2-stage approach is typically indicated for cases that demonstrate tunnel enlargement (>12 mm) that would compromise graft fixation or non-anatomic tunnel placement that will interfere with placement of the revision tibial tunnel3. The aim of the first stage is to re-establish adequate bone stock to optimize future tunnel placement and healing of the ACL graft during the second stage. We believe that this 2-stage approach is a reliable and safe method of treating enlarged, irregularly shaped bone tunnel defects while minimizing the risk of complications. Furthermore, the use of allograft material avoids the donor-site morbidity and volume limitations associated with the use of autograft bone. In the case of the femoral tunnel, the injectable bone graft composite has the advantage of being easily delivered arthroscopically while completely filling irregularly shaped tunnels. The use of bone marrow aspirate concentrate may improve the rate of graft healing as well as a hydrating substance to reduce viscosity and facilitate the flow of the bone graft material through the cannula16,17. For the tibia, especially in cases of lengthy tibial bone deficiencies, allograft bone dowels are commercially available off-the-shelf in a variety of different lengths and diameters to allow for adequate fill of bone defects.It is well known that outcomes following revision ACL reconstruction are inferior to those following primary ACL reconstruction, with a number of variables, beyond those associated with the surgical technique, influencing clinical outcomes18. Few studies have reported on the results of 2-stage revision ACL reconstruction with use of allograft bone; however, a high rate of allograft bone integration and improved bone quality at the time of revision ACL reconstruction have been reported13. Moreover, Mitchell et al. reported no differences in either subjective outcomes or failure rates between the 1-stage and 2-stage revision ACL reconstruction groups11.Utilize computed tomography for preoperative assessment and measurement of the extent of osteolysis.If possible, obtain the operative report for the index ACL procedure in order to identify any preexisting hardware and to obtain any instrumentation that may be needed to facilitate hardware removal.Multiple bone dowel sizes are available off the shelf.A 70° arthroscope can aid in visualization of the entire tibial and femoral tunnel.Although the bone graft matrix can be injected while the joint is filled with irrigation fluid, we find it easier to administer the graft under dry arthroscopic conditions.Place the scope inside the tibial tunnel to confirm appropriate removal of soft tissue and hardware. Circumferential native cancellous bone should be visualized.It is acceptable to retain previous hardware if it does not interfere with the new tunnel placement.Utilize prior incisions to access the tibial tunnel.Do not underestimate the amount of bone graft needed for each tunnel.Avoid excessive force during impaction of the dowels.ACLR = Anterior cruciate ligament reconstructionBMAC = Bone marrow aspirate concentrateMRI = Magnetic resonance imagingCT = Computed tomographyBTB = Bone-patellar tendon-boneDVT = Deep vein thrombosisROM = Range of motion.",0

The clinical outcome was assessed using the visual analog scale and Freiburg ankle score, magnetic resonance imaging evaluation using the Henderson-Kreuz scoring system and T2 mapping. Clinical assessment revealed improved visual analog scale and Freiburg ankle scores. The radiologic analysis and T2 relaxation time values indicated the formation of hyaline-like repair tissue. Polymer-based autologous chondrocytes has been shown to be a safe and clinically effective long-term treatment of articular cartilage defects in the talus.",0

MSCs, which were obtained from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat and cultivated, were injected into normal SD rats in which multiple tissues had been injured including anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial meniscus, and articular cartilage of the femoral condyles. At 4 weeks after injection Of MSCS, fluorescent microscopic observation, immunohistochemical or histological examinations were performed to evaluate mobilization of MSCs into injured tissue and their contribution to tissue regeneration. In the group of 1 X 10(6) MSCS injection, GFP positive cells could mobilize into the injured ACL alone in all 8 knees. In the group of 1 X 10(7) MSCs injection, GFP positive cells were observed in the injured site of ACL in all 8 knees and in the injured site of medial meniscus and cartilage of femoral condyles in 6 of 8 knees. More interestingly, extracellular matrix stained by toluidine blue was present around GFP positive cells in the injured femoral condyles cartilage and medial meniscus, indicating tissue regeneration. Intraarticularly injected MSCs could mobilize into the injured tissues, and probably contributed to tissue regeneration. This study demonstrated the possibility of intraarticular injection of MSCs for the treatment of intraarticular tissue injuries including ACL, meniscus, or cartilage. If this treatment option is established, it can be minimally invasive compared to conventional surgeries for these tissues.",0

Both the ELR-based hydrogel alone and the ELR-based hydrogel embedded with rabbit mesenchymal stromal cells (rMSCs) were tested for the regeneration of critical subchondral defects in 10 New Zealand rabbits. Thus, cylindrical osteochondral defects were filled with an aqueous solution of ELRs and the animals sacrificed at 4 months for histological and gross evaluation of features of biomaterial performance, including integration, cellular infiltration, surrounding matrix quality and the new matrix in the defects. Although both approaches helped cartilage regeneration, the results suggest that the specific composition of the rMSC-containing hydrogel permitted adequate bone regeneration, whereas the ELR-based hydrogel alone led to an excellent regeneration of hyaline cartilage. In conclusion, the ELR cross-linker solution can be easily delivered and forms a stable well-integrated hydrogel that supports infiltration and de novo matrix synthesis.",0

In this study, cartilage repair of full-thickness chondral defects in the knees of Goettinger minipigs was assessed by treatment with a cell-free collagen type-I gel or a collagen type-I gel seeded with autologous chondrocytes. As a control, abrasion arthroplasty was included. In 18 adult Goettinger minipigs, three full-thickness chondral defects were created in one knee of the hind leg. They were either treated with a cell-free collagen gel, a collagen gel seeded with 2 x 10(5)/ml chondrocytes, or left untreated. All animals were allowed unlimited weight bearing. At 6, 12, and 52 weeks, 6 animals were sacrificed. Immediately after recovery, a non-destructive biomechanical testing was performed. The repair tissue quality was evaluated histologically, and the O'Driscoll score was calculated. After 6 weeks, a high number of cells migrated into the initially cell-free collagen gel. After 1 year, a hyaline-like repair tissue in both groups has been created. As assessed by O'Driscoll scoring and col-II staining, repair tissue quality of the initially cell-free gel was equal to defects treated by cell-seeded collagen gel implantation after 1 year. All untreated control defects displayed a fibrous repair tissue. The mechanical properties represented by the e-modulus were inconsistent in the course of the study. The implantation of a cell-free collagen type-I gel can lead to a high-quality repair tissue in the Goettinger minipig that equals a cell-based procedure after 1 year postoperatively.

However, most current studies tend to focus on engineering cartilage; interface integration has been somewhat neglected. An endogenous regenerative strategy that simultaneously increases the recruitment of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and chondrocytes may improve interface integration and cartilage regeneration. In this study, a novel functionalized self-assembling peptide hydrogel (KLD-12/KLD-12-LPP, KLPP) containing link protein N-peptide (LPP) was designed to optimize cartilage repair. KLPP hydrogel was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and rheometry. KLPP hydrogel shared a similar microstructure to KLD-12 hydrogel which possesses a nanostructure with a fiber diameter of 25-35 nm. In vitro experiments showed that KLPP hydrogel had little cytotoxicity, and significantly induced chondrocyte migration and increased BMSC migration compared to KLD-12 hydrogel. In vivo results showed that defects treated with KLPP hydrogel had higher overall International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scores, Safranin-O staining scores and cumulative histology scores than untreated defects or defects treated with KLD-12 hydrogel, although defects treated with KLD-12 and KLPP hydrogels received similar type II collagen immunostaining scores. All these findings indicated that the simple injectable functionalized self-assembling peptide hydrogel KLPP facilitated simultaneous recruitment of endogenous chondrocytes and BMSCs to promote interface integration and improve cartilage regeneration, holding great potential as a one-step surgery strategy for endogenous cartilage repair.",0

Purpose: To evaluate the reliability of the ICRS scoring system using an animal cartilage repair model. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A chondral defect with an area of 1.5 cm 2 was made in the medial femoral condyle of 18 domestic pigs. Five weeks later, 9 pigs were treated using a novel recombinant human type III collagen/polylactide scaffold, and 9 were left to heal spontaneously. After 4 months, the pigs were sacrificed, then 3 arthroscopic surgeons evaluated the medial femoral condyles via video-recorded simulated arthroscopy using the ICRS scoring system. The surgeons repeated the evaluation twice within a 9-month period using their recorded arthroscopy. Results: The porcine cartilage repair model produced cartilage repair tissue of poor to good quality. The mean ICRS total scores for all observations were 6.6 (SD, 2.6) in arthroscopy, 5.9 (SD, 2.7) in the first reevaluation, and 6.2 (SD, 2.8) in the second reevaluation. The interrater reliability with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the ICRS total scores (ICC, 0.46-0.60) and for each individual subscore (ICC, 0.26-0.71) showed poor to moderate reliability. The intrarater reliability with the ICC also showed poor to moderate reliability for ICRS total scores (ICC, 0.52-0.59) and for each individual subscore (ICC, 0.29-0.58). A modified Bland-Altman plot for the initial arthroscopy and for the 2 reevaluations showed an evident disagreement among the observers. Conclusion: In an animal cartilage repair model, the ICRS scoring system seems to have poor to moderate reliability. Clinical Relevance: Arthroscopic assessment of cartilage repair using the ICRS scoring method has limited reliability. We need more objective methods with acceptable reliability to evaluate cartilage repair outcomes.",0

Although the autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) is one of the promising approaches for cartilage repair, it requires in vitro cell expansion to get sufficient cells, but chondrocytes lose their chondrogenic phenotype during expansion by monolayer culture, leading to de-differentiation. In this study, a heparin-based hydrogel was evaluated and optimized to induce cartilage regeneration with de-differentiated chondrocytes. First, re-differentiation of de-differentiated chondrocytes encapsulated in heparin-based hydrogels was characterized in vitro with various polymer concentrations (from 3 to 20 wt.%). Even under a normal cell culture condition (no growth factors or chondrogenic components), efficient re-differentiation of cells was observed with the optimum at 10 wt.% hydrogel, showing the complete re-differentiation within a week. Efficient re-differentiation and cartilage formation of de-differentiated cell/hydrogel construct were also confirmed in vivo by subcutaneous implantation on the back of nude mice. Finally, excellent cartilage regeneration and good integration with surrounding, similar to natural cartilage, was also observed by delivering de-differentiated chondrocytes using the heparin-based hydrogel in partial-thickness defects of rabbit knees whereas no healing was observed for the control defects. These results demonstrate that the heparin-based hydrogel is very efficient for re-differentiation of expanded chondrocytes and cartilage regeneration without using any exogenous inducing factors, thus it could serve as an injectable cell-carrier and scaffold for cartilage repair. Excellent chondrogenic nature of the heparin-based hydrogel might be associated with the hydrogel characteristic that can secure endogenous growth factors secreted from chondrocytes, which then can promote the chondrogenesis, as suggested by the detection of TGF-β1 in both in vitro and in vivo cell/hydrogel constructs.",0

Cell-based technology such as autologous chondrocyte implantation may in some cases provide durable cartilage repair, but availability of this procedure is often restricted due to cost constraints. There have been promising outcomes reported with the use of scaffolds seeded with activated bone marrow aspirate concentrate in cases of chondral injury. There are clear advantages to cell-based cartilage repair techniques that are performed as a single-stage procedure, particularly when the repair technology can be used in a minimally invasive manner. We present an arthroscopic technique of cartilage repair using a hyaluronic acid-based scaffold associated with activated bone marrow aspirate concentrate. This technique is a cost-effective, minimally invasive, single-stage procedure that has the potential for routine use in a wide range of cartilage lesion types and locations.",0

It relies on the migration of chondrocytes out of cartilage particles into a biomaterial. So far, there is no efficient way to finely mince cartilage. No consensus exists on the nature of the biomaterial to be used to promote chondrocyte migration. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study aimed to investigate the potential clinical use of a custom-made mincing device as well as a possible alternative biomaterial to fibrin glue. The device was tested for its effect on chondrocyte viability and on subsequent chondrocyte migration into either a fibrin or a collagen gel. We hypothesized that device mincing would allow finer cutting and consequently more cell migration and that the gelation mechanism of the collagen biomaterial, which uses the clotting of platelet-rich plasma, would enhance matrix production by outgrown chondrocytes. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Cartilage from 12 patients undergoing knee arthroplasty was taken from the femoral condyles and subsequently either hand minced or device minced. The viability and the degree of outgrowth were quantified with live/dead assay on the generated cartilage particles and on the gels in which these particles were embedded, respectively. Matrix deposition in the biomaterials by the outgrown cells was investigated with histology. Results: The device allowed rapid mincing of the cartilage and produced significantly smaller pieces than hand mincing. The initial chondrocyte viability in cartilage particles dropped by 25% with device mincing as compared with no mincing. However, the viability in hand-minced, device-minced, and unminced samples was no longer different after 7 and 28 days in culture. Outgrowth scores were similar among the 3 groups. Fibrin and collagen biomaterials equally supported chondrocyte outgrowth and survival, but neither promoted matrix deposition after in vitro culture. Conclusion: The outgrowth potential, the viability after 28 days in culture, and the matrix deposition were not different between the mincing techniques and the tested biomaterials, yet device mincing is faster and results in significantly smaller cartilage particles. Clinical Relevance: Device mincing could become the standard method to mince cartilage for second-generation cartilage repair techniques.",0

Thus, repair of focal cartilage defects in hips requires more invasive and technically complex surgeries than simple arthroscopy or arthrotomy. Autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) is a second-generation bone marrow stimulation technique. Improvement in Tegner, Lysholm, International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS), and Cincinnati scores has been reported at 1 and 2 years after AMIC in knees. AMIC is potentially useful to repair defects in hips, but it is unknown whether it relieves symptoms or results in a durable construct.A surgical hip dislocation is used to access the defect. This is débrided to stable cartilage shoulders, necrotic bone is removed, and the lesion base is drilled. Autogenous bone graft is used for lesions with bony defects to create a level surface. Fibrin gel and a collagen membrane are placed to stabilize the superclot for fibrocartilage formation.We treated six patients with AMIC in the hip between 2009 and 2010. We obtained Oxford Hip and UCLA Activity Scores. Repair quality was assessed on 6-month postoperative MRI using the modified magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) system. Minimum 1-year followup data were available for four patients (range, 1-2.5 years).Postoperative Oxford Hip Scores ranged from 13 to 17, UCLA Activity Scores ranged from 5 to 10, and MOCART scores ranged from 55 to 75. No complications occurred.We describe AMIC in the hip. Although these patients had pain relief and improved function, long-term followup is necessary to assess the duration of improvement, durability of repair, and potential for arthrosis.Level IV, therapeutic study.

A more effective procedure that can produce hyaline-like cartilage is needed for articular cartilage repair. Mosaic osteochondral grafts for large osteochondral defects often show poor integration between the grafts and the surrounding normal cartilage, leading to defective cracks filled with fibrous tissue instead of hyaline-like cartilage. In the present study, we aimed to repair the defective cracks with a calcium alginate (CaAlg) hydrogel containing bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4)-enhanced adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). Methods ADSCs were transduced with BMP4 (B-ADSCs). The expression of BMP4 and type II collagen was confirmed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Swine models of large cartilage defects of the knee were constructed and received one of the four treatments: mosaicplasty only, mosaicplasty with the CaAlg hydrogel, mosaicplasty with the CaAlg hydrogel containing ADSCs, or mosaicplasty with the CaAlg hydrogel containing B-ADSCs injected into the defective cracks. Outcomes were evaluated at 12 and 24 weeks after surgery. Results The in vitro study showed that the osteogenic and chondrogenic activities of the B-ADSCs were enhanced compared with those of the control. In vivo, in the group that received mosaicplasty-containing B-ADSCs, osteochondral tissue was completely integrated with an intact surface. Additionally, the histological scores of the mosaicplasty-containing B-ADSCs group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. Biomechanical examination confirmed that the neocartilage possessed properties similar to those of normal cartilage. Conclusions Mosaicplasty and hydrogel containing B-ADSCs promoted the repair of large cartilage defects by regenerating hyaline cartilage and repairing dead spaces between osteochondral grafts and donor-site defects, thus improving the feasibility and success rate of one-stage complete repair surgery for large osteochondral defects. This proposed method provides a novel and effective means for the repair of large articular osteochondral defects.",0

Ergebnisse einer arthroskopischen Studie,"Zielstellung: Die hohe Tibiakopfosteotomie (HTO) stellt ein etabliertes Verfahren bei der Behandlung unikompartimenteller medialer Gonarthrosen dar. Diese Studie wurde mit dem Ziel durchgeführt, eine mögliche Knorpelregeneration nach HTO in Beziehung zu den bei der Indexoperation angewandten arthroskopischen Knorpeltherapieverfahren zu untersuchen. Dazu wurden 1,5 Jahre nach medial öffnender HTO im Rahmen der Metallentfernung Kontrollarthroskopien durchgeführt. Material und Methode: Bei 135 Patienten (72 Männer und 63 Frauen; Altersmittelwert 48,8 Jahre) erfolgte nach knöcherner Konsolidierung einer Opening-Wedge-HTO (1,5 Jahre) die Metallentfernung mit gleichzeitiger Kontrollarthroskopie. Die Schwere der Knorpelschäden wurde durch das ICRS-Schema (International Cartilage Repair Society) bestimmt. Ergebnisse: Bei ursprünglich Grad III konnte im Bereich des medialen Femurkondyls in 40,4 % und im Bereich des medialen Tibiaplateaus in sogar 62,3 % eine verbesserte Knorpelqualität festgestellt werden. Dagegen kam es in 13,1 % im Bereich des MFC und 8,5 % im Bereich des TM zu einer Verschlechterung der ursprünglichen Grad-III-Läsionen in einen kompletten Defekt (Grad-IV-Schaden). Am besten schnitten dabei diejenigen Patienten ab, bei denen im Verlauf der Indexoperation eine Thermoablation durchgeführt wurde. Alle kompletten Defekte wurden anlässlich der Indexoperation durch Mikrofrakturierung nach Steadman behandelt. In knapp ⅔ der ehemaligen Defekte am MFC und in etwa ⅓ der ehemaligen TM-Defekte wurde dabei im Verlauf der Kontrollarthroskopie eine Auffüllung der ehemaligen Defektzone mit in der Hakenprobe stabilen Regeneraten nachgewiesen. Schlussfolgerungen: Die medial öffnende HTO in Kombination mit einer arthroskopischen Knorpeltherapie erbringt einerseits ein gutes klinisches Outcome und andererseits kommt es bei einem Teil der Patienten zu einer partiellen Regeneration der geschädigten Knorpelflächen. Ein Zusammenhang zwischen klinischem Outcome und der Knorpelregeneration konnte jedoch nicht sicher nachgewiesen werden. Nach unseren Untersuchungen ist die klinische Verbesserung in erster Linie auf die Wiederherstellung physiologischer Achsverhältnisse zurückzuführen. Inwieweit die Knorpelregeneration möglicherweise aber das Langzeitresultat beeinflusst, bleibt ungewiss.",0

Arthroscopic débridement and microfracture or retrograde drilling techniques are often insufficient and provide only temporary symptomatic relief. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the treatment of these lesions with osteochondral autografts.From 1999 to 2002, seven patients with osteochondral lesions of the capitellum humeri (five patients), trochlea (one patient), or radial head (one patient) were treated with cylindrical osteochondral grafts, which were harvested from the non-weight-bearing area of the proximal aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. The patients (three female and four male patients with an average age of seventeen years) were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively, with an average follow-up of fifty-nine months. The Broberg and Morrey score was chosen for functional evaluation of the elbow (with regard to motion, pain, strength, activities of daily living, and stability), and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score was used for the analysis of pain. All patients had imaging studies done preoperatively to evaluate the defect and postoperatively to assess the ingrowth and viability of the graft. The ipsilateral knee was examined for donor-site morbidity.The Broberg and Morrey score improved from a mean (and standard deviation) of 76.3 +/- 13.2 preoperatively to 97.6 +/- 2.7 postoperatively, and pain scores were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The mean elbow extension lag of 4.7 degrees +/- 5.8 degrees was reduced to 0 degrees postoperatively. Compared with the contralateral side, there was a mean preoperative flexion lag of 12.9 degrees +/- 13.8 degrees . At the time of the final follow-up, flexion was free and was equal bilaterally in all patients. None of the plain radiographs made at the time of follow-up showed any degenerative changes or signs of osteoarthritis. The postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scans showed graft viability and a congruent chondral surface in all seven patients. No donor-site morbidity was noted at one year postoperatively.The osteochondral autograft procedure described in the present study provides the opportunity to retain viable hyaline cartilage for the repair of osteochondral lesions in the elbow while restoring joint congruity and function and perhaps reducing the risk of osteoarthritis. These medium-term results suggest that the risks of a two-joint procedure are modest and justifiable. In addition, the described technique provides an option for revision surgery after the failure of other surgical procedures.",0

The most important feature of such implants is their appropriate rate of biodegradation, without the production of toxic metabolites. This study presents work on two different membranes made of polyester (L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone-PLCA) named “PVP and “Z”. The difference between them was the use of different pore precursors—polyvinylpyrrolidone in the “PVP” scaffold and gelatin in the “Z” scaffold. These were implemented in the articular cartilage defects of rabbit knee joints (defects were created for the purpose of the study). After 8, 16, and 24 weeks of observation, and the subsequent termination of the animals, histopathology and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) examinations were performed. Statistical analysis proved that the membranes support the regeneration process. GPC testing proved that the biodegradation process is progressing exponentially, causing the membranes to degrade at the appropriate time. The surgical technique we used meets all the requirements without causing the membrane to migrate after implantation. The “PVP” membrane is better due to the fact that after 24 weeks of observation there was a statistical trend for higher histological ratings. It is also better because it is easier to implant due to its lower fragility then membrane “Z”. We conclude that the selected membranes seem to support the regeneration of articular cartilage in the rabbit model.",0

Autogenous osteochondral transplantation represents a possible solution for creating hyaline or hyaline-like repair in the affected area that has a noninflammatory pathoorigin. This paper discusses the experimental background and over 15 years of clinical experience with autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty.Several series of animal studies and subsequent clinical practice of over 1,000 mosaicplasty patients were assessed to confirm the survival of transplanted hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage filling of donor sites located on relatively less weightbearing surfaces, as well as donor-site disturbances and morbidity. Histological evaluations of dog and horse implantations as well as several series of clinical evaluations in the human material are summarized in this paper. Clinical scores, different types of imaging techniques, second-look arthroscopies, histological examination of biopsy samples, and cartilage stiffness measurements were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes and quality of the transplanted cartilage.Analysis of clinical scores has shown good to excellent results in 92% of patients with femoral condylar implantations, 87% of tibial resurfacements, 74% of patellar and/or trochlear mosaicplasties and 93% of talar procedures. Longterm donor-site complaints measured by the Bandi score were minor and present only in 3% of patients. 81 out of the 98 control arthroscopies represented congruent and good gliding surfaces and histologically proven survival of the transplanted hyaline cartilage as well as fibrocartilage covering of the donor sites. Complications in the entire patient group were four deep infections and four deep venous thromboses. In nearly 8% of the cases excessive intraarticular bleeding was observed in the early postoperative period, as a minor complication of the procedure. Multicentric, comparative, prospective evaluation of 413 arthroscopic resurfacing procedures (mosaicplasty, Pridie drilling, abrasion arthroplasty and microfracture cases in homogenised subgroups) demonstrated that mosaicplasty resulted in favourable clinical outcome in the long-term follow-up compared to other three techniques. Durability of the early results was confirmed in long-term evaluations both of the femoral condylar implantations and talar mosaicplasties.According to our encouraging results in this increasingly large series, supported by similar findings from other centres, it seems that autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty may be an alternative for small and medium-sized focal chondral and osteochondral defects of weightbearing surfaces of the knee and other weightbearing synovial joints.",0

These structures have characteristics of both fibrous and cartilaginous tissues. The cartilage-like inner region and the fibrous vascularized outer region each has a distinct extracellular matrix, and resident meniscal fibrochondrocytes (MFCs) with distinct morphologies dependent on their location. Damage to the meniscus is common, and disruption of tissue structure and function result in erosion of the underlying articular cartilage. It has been observed that damage in the vascular periphery undergoes spontaneous repair, whereas damage of the inner region does not heal. While vascularity of the peripheral region plays a role in healing, recent findings have also suggested that local cellular composition influences local healing capacity. This study examined the variation in multipotential characteristics of cell populations isolated from different regions of the bovine meniscus. MFCs were isolated from the outer (vascular), inner (avascular), and horn (mixed) regions and induced toward chondrogenic, adipogenic, and osteogenic lineages. The results of this study suggest that MFCs from all regions of the meniscus possess a multilineage differentiation capability, particularly toward chondrogenesis and adipogenesis. MFCs from the outer region were most plastic, differentiating along all three mesenchymal lineages. These findings may underlie the experimental observation of improved integration of meniscus grafts from the outer zone and may have implications for developing strategies of cell-based meniscus repair.",0

533,https://openalex.org/W171220200,,Current cell-based strategies for knee cartilage injuries.,Cartilage is frequently damaged and shows little or no capacity for repair. Injuries that extend to the subchondral level show some capacity for repair due to the release of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells. This technique is employed in techniques like the microfracture but they are only appropriate for smaller cartilage defects. Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI) and Matrix-carried Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (MACI) are currently used in clinical practice to treat larger full thickness chondral defects in the knee with similar results. MACI does however have a number of advantages including its amenability to be performed arthroscopically or through a more limited approach without requiring arthrotomy. More definitive studies showing the long-term effects of the two cell-based treatments and comparing them are however awaited. There are a small number of studies using mesenchymal stem cells and further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed before this treatment is optimised. This review discussed these treatment options and provides an evidence-based approach to current clinical treatments.,0

An alternative may be to use mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). We have compared articular chondrocytes with MSC from human bone marrow (BM) and adipose tissue (AT), all cultured in HA scaffolds, for their ability to express genes and synthesize proteins associated with chondrogenesis. The cells were expanded in monolayer cultures. After seeding into the scaffold, the chondrocytes were maintained in medium, while the two MSC populations were given a chondrogenic differentiation medium. Chondrogenesis was assessed by real-time RT-PCR for chondrocyte-associated genes, by immunohistochemistry and by ELISA for collagens in the supernatant. Redifferentiation of the dedifferentiated chondrocytes in the HA scaffold was shown by a modest increase in type II collagen mRNA (COL2A1) and reduction in COL1A1. BM-MSC expressed 600-fold higher levels of COL2A1 than chondrocytes after 3 weeks in the scaffold. The levels of aggrecan (AGC1) and COL1A1 were similar for chondrocyte and BM-MSC scaffold cultures, while COL10A1 was higher in the BM-MSC. AT-MSC expressed levels of COL2A1 and COL1A1 similar to chondrocytes, but less AGC1 and COL10A1. Surprisingly, little collagen II protein was observed in the scaffold. Instead, collagen II was found in the culture medium. Chondrogenesis in HA scaffolds was more efficient using BM-MSC than AT-MSC or chondrocytes. Some of the secreted collagen II escaped entrapment in the extracellular space and was detected in the culture medium.",0

In animal models, mesenchymal stem cells have been used successfully to regenerate cartilage and bones. However, there have been no follow-up studies on humans treated with adipose-tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for the chondromalacia patellae. To obtain ADSCs, lipoaspirates were obtained from lower abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. The stromal vascular fraction was separated from the lipoaspirates by centrifugation after treatment with collagenase. The stem-cell-containing stromal vascular fraction was mixed with calcium chloride-activated platelet rich plasma and hyaluronic acid, and this ADSCs mixture was then injected under ultrasonic guidance into the retro-patellar joints of all three patients. Patients were subjected to pre- and post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Pre- and post-treatment subjective pain scores and physical therapy assessments measured clinical changes. One month after the injection of autologous ADSCs, each patient's pain improved 50-70%. Three months after the treatment, the patients' pain improved 80-90%. The pain improvement persisted over 1 year, confirmed by telephone follow ups. Also, all three patients did not report any serious side effects. The repeated magnetic resonance imaging scans at three months showed improvement of the damaged tissues (softened cartilages) on the patellae-femoral joints. In patients with chondromalacia patellae who have continuous anterior knee pain, percutaneous injection of autologous ADSCs may play an important role in the restoration of the damaged tissues (softened cartilages). Thus, ADSCs treatment presents a glimpse of a new promising, effective, safe, and non-surgical method of treatment for chondromalacia patellae.",0

A golden standard for the treatment of cartilage defects does not exist. Superficial lacerations of the joint cartilage do not have a tendency toward self healing but seem to stay stationary in many cases. Full thickness cartilage defects down to the subchondral bone plate or beyond have a proven tendency toward progression and therefore require a specific treatment. Since joint instability and unphysiological joint axes are cofactors for cartilage lesions, deformities and instability have to be corrected prior to cartilage-specific treatment. Various techniques for the regeneration of articular cartilage promise a physiological repair of even full thickness defects. Bone marrow stimulating procedures such as drilling, abrasion and microfracture induce the ingrowth of stemcells and fibroblasts into the defect with the anticipated result of a cartilage regeneration with fibrous tissue. To synthesize hyaline cartilage matrix, autologous chondrocytes are cultured in vitro before being delivered into cartilage defects under a periostal flap Autologous chondrocyte implantation has shown promising clinical results for up to 10 years. Osteochondral transplantations (e.g., mosaicplasty) do not represent a cartilage regeneration technique but are widely used for the treatment of smaller defects.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) loaded three-dimensional bilayer collagen scaffold for cartilage repair. Cross-linked three-dimensional bilayer collagen scaffolds seeded with or without MSCs were implanted into large cartilage defects (4 mm in diameter; 3 mm in depth) in rabbit knees. The untreated cartilage defects served as control. The tissue response was evaluated at 6 and 12 weeks after implantation by general histology and semi-quantitative histological grading systems. In addition, the repaired tissues were evaluated by mechanical test at 12 weeks after implantation. The MSCs-loaded collagen scaffold group showed the most hyaline cartilage, highest histological scores and compressive modulus. Moreover, it showed a good integration with the subchondral bone and adjacent cartilage. The structure of the novel bilayer collagen scaffolds provided architectural support for the differentiation of MSCs and demonstrated successful induction of in vivo chondrogenesis. These findings suggested that MSCs-loaded bilayer collagen scaffold could be an appealing candidate to be used for cartilage regeneration.",0

We designed a strategy to induce cartilage repair using acellular bone matrix (ABM), thereby creating an appropriate microenvironment for the in-situ cells with an easy surgical application. An in vitro system demonstrated that the ABM scaffold could promote cell adhesion, growth, proliferation, and chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells. This experiment was performed in a minipig cartilage repair model. The repaired tissue was hyaline-like cartilage according to the morphological and histological results. The mechanical properties of the repaired tissue were similar to those of normal cartilage.

This study evaluated the results of an in vivo animal study and provides short-term clinical results on a mixture of atelocollagen and fibrin glue-enhanced microfracture techniques in patients with osteochondral lesions (OCL) of the talus.This paper contains animal in vivo data and clinical outcomes on the effectiveness of atelocollagen. An in vivo animal study was conducted with full-thickness cartilage defects created in the femoral condyle of 12 rabbits equally divided into 4 groups evaluated at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Four chondral lesions were created according to one procedure on each rabbit with each lesion treated as follows: (1) microfracture, (2) microfracture and the lesion covered with atelocollagen, (3) microfracture and the lesion covered with mixture of atelocollagen and fibrin glue, and (4) microfracture and the lesion covered with fibrin glue. In the clinical evaluation, 17 patients were treated with a combination of microfracture and atelocollagen injection for symptomatic full-thickness OCL of the talus.

In the clinical evaluation, mean AOFAS improved from 62 to 88, mean HSS improved from 62 to 87, and mean VAS score improved from 64 to 18, respectively (p <0.001). Fifteen patients (89%) reported good or excellent satisfaction. We defined the improvement of most of the subchondral bone edema and bone cyst as well as a chondral lesion by radiologic evaluation.Rapid regeneration of cartilage was demonstrated in the in vivo animal study, and patients showed significant clinical improvement.

Integrated rosette strain gauges were calibrated and used to determine shear loading within stifle joints for up to 12 months. An activity index that compared extent of daily activity with tissue formation showed differences in the extent and quality of new tissue with the most active animal having the most new tissue formation. Shear loads were highest early and decreased with time indicating that cartilage tissue formation begins while tissues experience high shear loads and continues as the loads decrease toward normal physiological levels. Scaffolds with biomimetic support pegs facilitated the most rapid bone ingrowth and were noted to have more cartilage formation with better quality cartilage as measured using both indentation testing and histology. Comparison of implant placement depth to previous studies suggested that placement depth affects the amount of tissue formation. This study provides measurements of loading patterns and cartilage regeneration on a complete medial condylar surface replacement that can be used for preclinical testing of a tissue engineering approach for the most common form of early stage osteoarthritis, unicondylar disease. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The characteristics of cell-seed scaffolds, behavior of cells seeded into scaffolds, and surgical techniques were also discussed. Clinical outcomes and quality of repaired tissue were assessed using several standardized outcome assessment tools, magnetic resonance imaging scans, and biopsy histology.One-step cartilage repair could be divided into 2 types: chondrocyte-matrix complex (CMC) and autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC), both of which allow a simplified surgical approach. Studies with Level IV evidence have shown that 1-step cartilage repair techniques could significantly relieve symptoms and improve functional assessment (P < .05, compared with preoperative evaluation) at short-term follow-up. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging showed that 76% cases in all included case series showed at least 75% defect coverage in each lesion, and 3 studies clearly showed hyaline-like cartilage tissue in biopsy tissues by second-look arthroscopy.The 1-step cartilage repair technique, with its potential for effective, homogeneous distribution of chondrocytes and multipotent stem cells on the surface of the cartilage defect, is able to regenerate hyaline-like cartilage tissue, and it could be applied to cartilage repair by arthroscopy.Level IV, systematic review of Level II and IV studies.",0

The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of the level of in vitro maturation of engineered cartilaginous samples on the tissue quality after in vivo implantation. Samples were obtained from isolated swine articular chondrocytes embedded in fibrin glue. The cell-fibrin composites were either cultured in vitro or directly implanted in vivo for 1, 5, and 9 weeks. Other experimental samples were precultured for either 1 or 5 weeks in vitro and then implanted in vivo for 4 additional weeks. All the samples were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, and gene expression. The results strongly suggest that the in vivo culture in this model promoted a better tissue maturation than that obtained in the in vitro condition, and that 1 week in vitro preculture resulted in the primary structuring of the engineered composites and their subsequent maturation in vivo, without affecting the cell viability and activity, while a prolonged in vitro preculture caused a cell and matrix degeneration that could not be rescued in vivo.",0

Various techniques, both palliative and reparative, have been used to treat this pathology with variable success rates. In recent years, however, regenerative techniques, such as autologous chondrocyte implantation, have emerged as possible solutions for the treatment of chondral knee lesions. The use of classic autologous chondrocyte implantation (first generation) has been associated with several limitations. To address these problems, tissue-engineering techniques have been developed. We selected a biodegradable, biocompatible, hyaluronian-based scaffold for cell proliferation. This matrix autologous chondrocyte transplantation procedure avoids the use of periosteal flap, simplifies the surgical procedure, and can be performed using an arthroscopic procedure. Thus, the surgical morbidity and the recovery time for the patient are extremely reduced with no complications related to the periosteal flap. The short- to medium-term follow-up clinical and histological results are encouraging.",0

As bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) have the capacity to make both bone-like and cartilage-like tissues, they are an ideal cell population for use in the manufacture of osteochondral tissues. Effective differentiation of MSC to bone-like and cartilage-like tissues requires two unique medium formulations and this presents a challenge both in achieving initial MSC differentiation and in maintaining tissue stability when the unified osteochondral tissue is subsequently cultured in a single medium formulation. In this proof-of-principle study, we used an in-house fabricated microwell platform to manufacture thousands of micropellets formed from 166 MSC each. We then characterized the development of bone-like and cartilage-like tissue formation in the micropellets maintained for 8-14 days in sequential combinations of osteogenic or chondrogenic induction medium. When bone-like or cartilage-like micropellets were induced for only 8 days, they displayed significant phenotypic changes when the osteogenic or chondrogenic induction medium, respectively, was swapped. Based on these data, we developed an extended 14-day protocol for the pre-culture of bone-like and cartilage-like micropellets in their respective induction medium. Unified osteochondral tissues were formed by layering 12,000 osteogenic micropellets and 12,000 chondrogenic micropellets into a biphasic structure and then further culture in chondrogenic induction medium. The assembled tissue was cultured for a further 8 days and characterized via histology. The micropellets had amalgamated into a continuous structure with distinctive bone-like and cartilage-like regions. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of micropellet assembly for the formation of osteochondral-like tissues for possible use in osteochondral defect repair.",0

An indirect co-culture model was developed, representing a chondrocyte/scaffold-construct repair of a cartilage defect adjoining bone, where the bone could have varying degrees of degeneration. Human BM-MSCs were isolated from two areas of subchondral bone in each of five osteochondral tissue specimens from five patients undergoing knee arthroplasty. These two areas underlaid the macroscopically and histologically best and worst cartilage, representing early and late-stage OA, respectively. BM-MSCs were co-cultured with normal chondrocytes suspended in agarose, with the two cell types separated by a porous membrane. After 0, 7, 14 and 21 days, chondrocyte-agarose scaffolds were assessed by gene expression and biochemical analyses, and the abundance of selected proteins in conditioned media was assessed by ELISA. Co-culture with late-OA BM-MSCs resulted in a reduction in GAG deposition and a decreased expression of genes encoding matrix-specific proteins (COL2A1 and ACAN), compared to culturing with early OA BM-MSCs. The concentration of TGF-β1 was significantly higher in the early OA conditioned media. The results of this study have clinical implications for cartilage repair, suggesting that the health of the subchondral bone may influence the outcomes of chondrocyte-based repair strategies.",0

In this experimental study, we used the sheep animal model for the creation of knee cartilage defects. In the medial part of the trochlea and on the medial condyle of the femur, we created artificial defects (6 × 3 mm2) with microfractures. In four experimental sheep, both defects were subsequently filled with the porous acellular polyhydroxybutyrate/chitosan (PHB/CHIT)-based implant. Two sheep had untreated defects. We evaluated the quality of the newly formed tissue in the femoral trochlea defect site using imaging (X-ray, Computer Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)), macroscopic, and histological methods. Macroscopically, the surface of the treated regenerate corresponded to the niveau of the surrounding cartilage. X-ray examination 6 months after the implantation confirmed the restoration of the contour in the subchondral calcified layer and the advanced rate of bone tissue integration. The CT scan revealed a low regenerative potential in the bone zone of the defect compared to the cartilage zone. The percentage change in cartilage density at the defect site was not significantly different to the reference area (0.06–6.4%). MRI examination revealed that the healing osteochondral defect was comparable to the intact cartilage signal on the surface of the defect. Hyaline-like cartilage was observed in most of the treated animals, except for one, where the defect was repaired with fibrocartilage. Thus, the acellular, chitosan-based biomaterial is a promising biopolymer composite for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral defects of traumatic character. It has potential for further clinical testing in the orthopedic field, primarily with the combination of supporting factors.",0

Surgical options that exist to address this problem include realignment osteotomies and joint replacements. Realignment osteotomies are the more appropriate options in certain patient populations, especially with regard to age and level of activity. Since a high tibial osteotomy (HTO) was first used to manage malalignment of the knee and osteoarthritis, different techniques involving the use of specialized implants have been developed and further refined to good effect. There has also since been much research into the field of cartilage restoration techniques, both as a standalone treatment option and as an adjunct to a realignment osteotomy. This review attempts to detail the origin and the evolution of HTO, particularly in regard to combining this tried and tested procedure with adjunct cartilage restoration techniques, and the overall patient outcomes. A literature search on PubMed was performed, and articles pertaining to the outcomes of the use of an HTO and cartilage restoration techniques were reviewed. The literature in this field indicates good outcomes in terms of objective measurements of cartilage regeneration (such as arthroscopic visualization and magnetic resonance imaging evaluation) and subjective patient outcome scoring systems (such as the International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm scores) with a realignment osteotomy alone, and studies have shown that patient outcomes can be further improved with the use of a cartilage restoration procedure as an adjunct.",0

The better understanding of interactions of articular cartilage and subchondral bone in recent years led to increased attention to restoration of the entire osteochondral unit. In comparison to chondral lesions the regeneration of osteochondral defects is much more complex and a far greater surgical and therapeutic challenge. The damaged tissue does not only include the superficial cartilage layer but also the subchondral bone. For deep, osteochondral damage, as it occurs for example with osteochondrosis dissecans, the full thickness of the defect needs to be replaced to restore the joint surface (1). Eligible therapeutic procedures have to consider these two different tissues with their different intrinsic healing potential (2). In the last decades, several surgical treatment options have emerged and have already been clinically established (3-6). Autologous or allogeneic osteochondral transplants consist of articular cartilage and subchondral bone and allow the replacement of the entire osteochondral unit. The defects are filled with cylindrical osteochondral grafts that aim to provide a congruent hyaline cartilage covered surface (3,7,8). Disadvantages are the limited amount of available grafts, donor site morbidity (for autologous transplants) and the incongruence of the surface; thereby the application of this method is especially limited for large defects. New approaches in the field of tissue engineering opened up promising possibilities for regenerative osteochondral therapy. The implantation of autologous chondrocytes marked the first cell based biological approach for the treatment of full-thickness cartilage lesions and is now worldwide established with good clinical results even 10 to 20 years after implantation (9,10). However, to date, this technique is not suitable for the treatment of all types of lesions such as deep defects involving the subchondral bone (11). The sandwich-technique combines bone grafting with current approaches in Tissue Engineering (5,6). This combination seems to be able to overcome the limitations seen in osteochondral grafts alone. After autologous bone grafting to the subchondral defect area, a membrane seeded with autologous chondrocytes is sutured above and facilitates to match the topology of the graft with the injured site. Of course, the previous bone reconstruction needs additional surgical time and often even an additional surgery. Moreover, to date, long-term data is missing (12). Tissue Engineering without additional bone grafting aims to restore the complex structure and properties of native articular cartilage by chondrogenic and osteogenic potential of the transplanted cells. However, again, it is usually only the cartilage tissue that is more or less regenerated. Additional osteochondral damage needs a specific further treatment. In order to achieve a regeneration of the multilayered structure of osteochondral defects, three-dimensional tissue engineered products seeded with autologous/allogeneic cells might provide a good regeneration capacity (11). Beside autologous chondrocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) seem to be an attractive alternative for the development of a full-thickness cartilage tissue. In numerous preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies, mesenchymal stem cells have displayed excellent tissue regeneration potential (13,14). The important advantage of mesenchymal stem cells especially for the treatment of osteochondral defects is that they have the capacity to differentiate in osteocytes as well as chondrocytes. Therefore, they potentially allow a multilayered regeneration of the defect. In recent years, several scaffolds with osteochondral regenerative potential have therefore been developed and evaluated with promising preliminary results (1,15-18). Furthermore, fibrin glue as a cell carrier became one of the preferred techniques in experimental cartilage repair and has already successfully been used in several animal studies (19-21) and even first human trials (22). The following protocol will demonstrate an experimental technique for isolating mesenchymal stem cells from a rabbit's bone marrow, for subsequent proliferation in cell culture and for preparing a standardized in vitro-model for fibrin-cell-clots. Finally, a technique for the implantation of pre-established fibrin-cell-clots into artificial osteochondral defects of the rabbit's knee joint will be described.",0

Tissue-engineered cartilage-like tissue was prepared by culturing autologous chondrocytes in atelocollagen gel for 3-4 weeks. A total of 73 knees of 72 patients with full-thickness cartilage defects were implanted with this tissue-engineered cartilage-like tissue. The follow-up of these patients for \textbackslashtextgreater 5 years (range 5-11 years, median 8.0 years) is reported. The patients were evaluated clinically using a rating scale, as well as arthroscopically, biomechanically, and histologically. A modified magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) system was used to quantify the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the lesions. The patient or defect factors influencing the final clinical outcomes were also investigated. Clinical rating improved significantly after implantation of tissue-engineered cartilage-like tissue. Arthroscopic findings at 2 years after implantation were graded as normal or nearly normal according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scale in 64 of 73 knees (87.7 %). Biomechanically, stiffness of the graft almost equalled the surrounding normal cartilage (87.9-102.5 %) at 2 years after implantation. Histologically, overall assessment of the repaired tissue by ICRS Visual Assessment Scale II was 70.4 +/- A 20.8. The average MOCART score was 13.5 +/- A 11.3 (0-45) preoperatively, 66.6 +/- A 16.8 (10-90) at 1 year after implantation, 70.4 +/- A 16.1 (15-90) at 2 years after implantation, and 72.5 +/- A 17.4 (15-95) at the final follow-up, indicating that MRI results were maintained. Among the factors investigated, only arthroscopic grade of the repaired lesion at 2 years after implantation was significantly correlated with the final clinical scores. Implantation of tissue-engineered cartilage-like tissue for the cartilage defects of the knee was effective in short- to midterm post-operatively. This procedure can be proposed as one option for repairing full-thickness cartilage defect of the knee. IV.",0

Patients and Methods: Autologous BM-MSCs were culture expanded, placed on PR-FG intraoperatively, and then transplanted into 5 full-thickness cartilage defects of femoral condyles of 5 patients and covered with an autologous periosteal flap. Patients were evaluated clinically at 6 and 12 mo by the Lysholm and Revised Hospital for Special Surgery Knee (RHSSK) scores and radiographically by x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the same time points. Repair tissue in 2 patients was rated arthroscopically after 12 mo using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Arthroscopic Score. Study Design: Case series; level of evidence 4. Results: All patients’ symptoms improved over the follow-up period of 12 mo. Average Lysholm and RHSSK scores for all patients showed statistically significant improvement at 6 and 12 mo postoperatively ( P &lt; 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the 6 and 12 mo postoperative clinical scores ( P = 0.18). ICRS arthroscopic scores were 8/12 and 11/12 (nearly normal) for the 2 patients who consented to arthroscopy. MRI of 3 patients at 12 mo postoperatively revealed complete defect fill and complete surface congruity with native cartilage, whereas that of 2 patients showed incomplete congruity.

Three patients also underwent ACL-reconstruction; one patient a high tibial osteotomy. The underlying indication was osteochondrosis dissecans in four and trauma in five patients. The defect size was 25×25mm in three patients and 30×30 in six patients and the depth ranged from eight to 14mm. All OCD lesions were located on the medial femoral condyle; two of the traumatic lesions were located on the lateral femoral condyle. Clinical outcome was assessed using the Lysholm and IKDC scores. Radiographic incorporation was evaluated using serial radiographs and MR imaging at one year post surgery. All patients were reviewed at three, six, 12, and 24months following surgery.The Lysholm (IKDC) score improved significantly (p=0.02 resp. p=0.007) within and between patients during the follow-up period from 40.9 (37) to 90.9 (87.1) at 2years. Radiographic union was observed in all patients at three months; on MR imaging at one year osseous integration was observed in eight patients. Graft subsidence with loss of the overlying cartilage was observed in one and subchondral cystic changes at the implantation side were seen in another patient.The results of this case series suggest that irradiated osteochondral allograft provides significant medium-term clinical improvement in patients treated for large osteochondral lesions of the femoral condyles.IV, case series.",0

It involves the arthroscopic harvesting and in vitro culture of chondrocytes that are subsequently implanted into a previously identified chondral defect. The aim is to produce a repair tissue that closely resembles hyaline articular cartilage that gradually becomes incorporated, restoring joint congruity. Over the long term, it is hoped that this will prevent the progression of full-thickness articular cartilage defects to osteoarthritis. This article reviews the indications and operative procedure performed in ACI. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences that provide optimal visualization of articular cartilage in the post-operative period are discussed. Normal appearances of ACI on MRI are presented along with common complications that are encountered with this technique.",0

The goal of the present study was to synthesize and characterize a novel biocompatible and biodegradable hydrogel comprised of poly(ethylene glycol), gelatin, and genipin, and examine the hydrogel as an injectable biomaterial in combination with a cyanoacrylate-based surgical sealant for cartilage repair. An osteochondral knee defect was generated in 24 rats, then the hydrogel, with or without a surgical sealant, was injected into the defect and followed for 14 days. The results demonstrated that the hydrogel is biocompatible and biodegradable, and that the cyanoacrylate-based surgical sealant is a relatively safe option for maintaining the hydrogel in the defect. This is the first study describing a cyanoacrylate-based surgical sealant in combination with a polymer hydrogel for cartilage repair.",0

The TEC derived from the synovial MSCs was implanted into chondral defects in the medial femoral condyle of the knee. The integration boundary of repair tissue with the adjacent host cartilage was morphologically and biomechanically evaluated at 6 months post-implantation. Histological assessments showed that the repair tissue in each zone was well integrated with the adjacent host cartilage, with an apparent secure continuity of the extracellular matrix. There were no significant differences in histological scores between the integration boundary and the center of the repair tissue at every zone. Nonetheless, in all the specimens subjected to mechanical testing, failure occurred at the integration boundary. The average tensile strength of the integration boundary vs normal cartilage was 0.6 vs 4.9, 3.0 vs 12.6, and 5.5 vs 12.8MPa at the superficial, middle, and deep layers, respectively. Thus, these results indicate the most fragile point in the repair tissue remained at the integration boundary in spite of the apparent secure tissue continuity and equivalent histological quality with the center of the repair tissue. Such tissue vulnerability at the surface integration boundary could affect the long-term durability of the tissue repair, and thus, special consideration will be needed in the post-operative rehabilitation programming to enhance the longevity of such repair tissues in response to normal knee loading.",0

Long-term implant performance was addressed in a standardized in vitro model. PGA implants (+/- bovine chondrocytes) were placed inside cartilage rings punched out of bovine femoral trochleas (outer Ø 6 mm; inner defect Ø 2 mm) and cultured for 84 days (12 weeks). Cartilage/PGA hybrids were subsequently analyzed by histology (hematoxylin/eosin; safranin O), immunohistochemistry (aggrecan, collagens 1 and 2), protein assays, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions, and implant push-out force measurements. Cartilage/PGA hybrids remained vital with intact matrix until 12 weeks, limited loss of proteoglycans from ""host"" cartilage or cartilage-PGA interface, and progressively diminishing release of proteoglycans into the supernatant. By contrast, the collagen 2 content in cartilage and cartilage-PGA interface remained approximately constant during culture (with only little collagen 1). Both implants (+/- cells) displayed implant colonization and progressively increased aggrecan and collagen 2 mRNA, but significantly decreased push-out forces over time. Cell-loaded PGA showed significantly accelerated cell colonization and significantly extended deposition of aggrecan. Augmented chondrogenic differentiation in PGA and cartilage/PGA-interface for up to 84 days suggests initial cartilage regeneration. Due to the PGA resorbability, however, the model exhibits limitations in assessing the ""lateral implant bonding"".",0

A total of 14 patients underwent arthroscopy of the knee for a chronic lesion on the femoral condyles or trochlea. In addition to the routine cartilage biopsy, a second biopsy of cartilage was taken from the edge of the lesion. The cells isolated from both sources underwent parallel cultivation as monolayer and three-dimensional (3D) alginate culture. The cell yield, viability, capacity for proliferation, morphology and the expressions of typical cartilage genes (collagen I, COL1; collagen II, COL2; aggrecan, AGR; and versican, VER) were assessed. The cartilage differentiation indices (COL2/COL1, AGR/VER) were calculated. The control biopsies revealed a higher mean cell yield (1346 cells/mg vs 341 cells/mg), but similar cell proliferation, viability and morphology compared with the cells from the edge of the lesion. The cartilage differentiation indices were superior in control cells: COL2/COL1 (threefold in biopsies (non-significant)); sixfold in monolayer cultures (p = 0.012), and 7.5-fold in hydrogels (non-significant), AGR/VER (sevenfold in biopsies (p = 0.04), threefold (p = 0.003) in primary cultures and 3.5-fold in hydrogels (non-significant)).

Conventional treatment methods such as abrasion chondroplasty and mosaicplasty have limitations in terms of quality of the resultant cartilage and donor site morbidity. A more recent technique, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) results in hyaline cartilage formation and gives good long-term outcome, but requires a high-level cell culture facility and two surgical procedures. The patient was a young female with knee pain, intermittent locking and feeling of “joint mouse”. MRI scan and arthroscopy showed a 2x2 cm full thickness osteochondral defect in the medial femoral condyle. A free fragment of articular cartilage was found, which was extracted arthroscopically, and chondrocytes were cultured from it in the Juma laboratory. Subsequently, patient underwent surgery whereby the chondrocytes were injected under a periosteal patch sewn over the defect. Over six months, patient’s symptoms completely resolved and she returned to full function. A repeat arthroscopy after one year revealed complete filling of the previous defect with normal appearing cartilage indicating success of the procedure.

The three-dimensional biomimetic scaffold (Fin-Ceramica Faenza S.p.A., Faenza-Italy) was obtained by nucleating collagen fibrils with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, in two configurations, bi- and tri-layered, to reproduce, respectively, chondral and osteochondral anatomy. Chondral defects (lateral condyle) and deep osteochondral defects (medial condyle) were made in the distal epiphysis of the third metacarpal bone of both forelimbs of two adult horses and treated respectively with the chondral and osteochondral grafts. Both animals were euthanised six months follow up. The images obtained at the second look arthroscopy evaluation, performed two months after surgery, demonstrated good filling of the chondral and osteo-chondral defects without any inflammatory reaction around and inside the lesions. At the histological analysis the growth of trabecular bone in the osteochondral lesion was evident. Only in one case, the whole thickness of the osteochondral lesion was filled by fibrocartilaginous tissue. The formation of a tidemark line was evident at the interface with the newly formed bone. Newly formed fibrocartilaginous tissue was present in the area of the chondral defect. Initial alignment of the collagen fibres was recognisable with polarised light in both groups. The results of the present pilot study showed that this novel osteochondral and chondral scaffold may act as a suitable matrix to facilitate orderly regeneration of bone and hyaline-like cartilage.",0

In fact, to promote the growth of articular cartilage and subchondral bone is a real challenge, due to the different functional and anatomical properties. To this purpose, alginate is a promising biomaterial for a scaffold-based approach, claiming optimal biocompatibility and good chondrogenic potential. A previously developed mineralized alginate scaffold was investigated in terms of the ability to support osteochondral regeneration both in a large and medium size animal model. The results were evaluated macroscopically and by microtomography, histology, histomorphometry, and immunohistochemical analysis. No evidence of adverse or inflammatory reactions was observed in both models, but limited subchondral bone formation was present, together with a slow scaffold resorption time.

In the athlete, untreated articular cartilage defects can represent a career threatening injury and create a significant obstacle in returning to full athletic participation. The markedly limited healing potential of articular cartilage often leads to continued deterioration and progressive functional limitations. Numerous studies have shown that full thickness articular cartilage lesions are frequently encountered at the time of arthroscopy, particularly associated with athletic injury. A variety of surgical treatment options exist, including debridement, microfracture, osteochondral autograft, osteochondral allograft, and autologous chondrocyte implantation. Each technique has advantages and limitations for restoring articular cartilage function, and emerging technology continues to improve the results of treatment.

Studies with growth factors, implantation of autologous chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells have led to variable, to some extent inconsistent, results. This work compares osteochondral knee-defect repair in rabbits upon implantation of a previously described alginate/(poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) osteochondral scaffold in distinct conditions. Systems were either in vitro pre-cultured with a small number of allogeneic chondrocytes under fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 stimulation or the same amount of allogeneic, marrow derived, mesenchymal stem cells (without any pre-differentiation), or loaded with microsphere-encapsulated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 within the alginate layer, or holding combinations of one or the other cell type with BMP-2. The experimental limit was 12 weeks, because a foregoing study with this release system had shown a maintained tissue response for at least 24 weeks post-operation. After only 6 weeks, histological analyses revealed newly formed cartilage-like tissue, which resembled the adjacent, normal cartilage in cell as well as BMP-2 treated defects, but cell therapy gave higher histological scores. This advantage evened out until 12 weeks. Combinations of cells and BMP-2 did not result in any additive or synergistic effect. Equally efficient osteochondral defect repair was achieved with chondrocyte, stem cell, and BMP-2 treatment. Expression of collagen X and collagen I, signs of ongoing ossification, were histologically undetectable, and the presence of aggrecan protein indicated cartilage-like tissue. In conclusion, further work should demonstrate whether spatiotemporally controlled, on-site BMP-2 release alone could become a feasible therapeutic approach to repair large osteochondral defects.",0

Cartilage repair can improve the symptoms and delay arthroplasty. The complete healing of damaged cartilage with the consistent reproduction of normal hyaline cartilage has not yet been achieved. The choice of harvesting site might influence the cells' abilities to modulate immunologic and inflammatory responses. Recently, dental pulp has been shown to contain a stem cell niche consisting of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) that maintain their self-renewal capacity due to the active environment in the dental pulp of deciduous teeth. Objective: The aim of this study was to critically review the current literature on the potential and limitations of the use of dental pulp-derived mesenchymal stem cells in cell-based therapies for cartilage regeneration. Methods: An electronic, customized search of scientific articles was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from their inception to December 2018. The inclusion criteria were applied, and the articles that described the use of DPSC in cartilage treatment were selected for complete evaluation. The articles were classified according to the scaffold used, experimental model, chondrogenic differentiation features, defect location, cartilage evaluation, and results. After the application of the eligibility criteria, a total of nine studies were selected and fully analyzed. Results: A variety of animal models were used, including mice, rats, rabbits, and miniature pigs, to evaluate the quality and safety of human DPSCs in the repair of cartilage defects. Among the articles, two studies focused on preclinical models of cartilage tissue engineering. Five studies implanted DPSCs in other animal sites. Conclusion: The use of DPSCs is a potential new stem cell therapy for articular cartilage repair. The preclinical evidence discussed in this article provides a solid foundation for future clinical trials. Impact statement Osteoarthritis presents an ever-increasing clinical and socioeconomic burden. While cartilage repair has the potential to improve symptoms and delay joint replacement, complete regeneration of hyaline cartilage has been an elusive goal. Dental pulp has been shown to contain a niche that protects dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) from the cumulative effects of genetic and environmental factors and maintains their self-renewal capacity due to the active environment. Transplantation and preclinical trials have demonstrated the strong potential of regenerative tissue-engineering protocols using DPSCs.",0

Seeded hBMSC were viable for 88 +/- A 8.9% during the entire experimental period in the constructs. GAG and DNA levels did not change. Perfusion induced collagen II and cyclic compression increased collagen X expression. Matrix stiffness was significantly increased after 28 days of cyclic compression.

Porcine synovial MSCs were cultured in monolayer at high density and were subsequently detached from the substratum. The cell/matrix complex spontaneously contracted to develop a basic TEC. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the basic TEC contained collagen I and III, fibronectin, and vitronectin. The basic TEC exhibited stable adhesion to the surface of a porcine cartilage matrix in an explant culture system. The TEC cultured in chondrogenic media exhibited elevated expression of glycosaminoglycan and chondrogenic marker genes. The TEC were implanted in vivo into chondral defects in the medial femoral condyle of 4-month-old pigs, followed by sacrifice after 6 months. Implantation of a TEC into chondral defects initiated repair with a chondrogenic-like tissue, as well as secure biological integration to the adjacent cartilage. Histologically, the repair tissue stained positively with Safranin O and for collagen II. Biomechanical evaluation revealed that repair tissue exhibited mechanical properties similar to those of normal porcine cartilage in static compression and friction tests.

After isolation and culture, hMSCs were seeded on biphasic composite constructs (hydroxyapatite + PR-FG) and transplanted into osteochondral defects of adult New Zealand white rabbits. Treatment of individual defects was applied by random assignment to one of five groups: (1) control, defects untreated; (2) hydroxyapatite, defects filled with hydroxyapatite only; (3) hydroxyapatite + PR-FG, defects filled with a composite of hydroxyapatite and PR-FG; (4) hydroxyapatite + PR-FG + undifferentiated hMSCs; and (5) hydroxyapatite + PR-FG + differentiated hMSCs. Rabbits were killed at 4 or 8 weeks post-surgery, at which time osteochondral repair was macroscopically and histologically evaluated and scored using the modified International Cartilage Repair Society scoring system. The group in which defects were seeded with differentiated hMSCs (group 5) showed superior healing of osteochondral defects based on macroscopic and histological observations compared to other groups. Specifically, 8 weeks after implantation, defects were filled with more hyaline-like cartilage and were better integrated with the surrounding native cartilage. The histological scores were significantly better than those of other groups (16.3 at 8 weeks, p \textbackslashtextless 0.01). Xenogeneic transplantation of differentiated hMSCs using a biphasic composite construct effectively repaired osteochondral defect in a rabbit model.

To mitigate the effects of dedifferentiation, this study employed a post-expansion aggregate culture step to enhance the chondrogenic phenotype of passaged articular chondrocytes (ACs) before their integration into self-assembled neocartilage constructs. The objective was twofold: (1) to explore how passage number (P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, and P7), with or without aggregate culture, affected construct properties; and (2) to determine the highest passage number that could form neocartilage with functional properties. Juvenile leporine ACs were passaged to P2-P7, with or without aggregate culture, and self-assembled into 5mm discs in non-adhesive agarose molds without using any exogenous scaffolds. Construct biochemical and biomechanical properties were assessed. With aggregate culture, neocartilage constructs had significantly higher collagen content, higher tensile properties, and flatter morphologies. These beneficial effects were most obvious at higher passage numbers. Specifically, collagen content, Young's modulus, and instantaneous compressive modulus in the P7, aggregate group were 53%, 116%, and 178% higher than those in the P7, non-aggregate group. Most interestingly, these extensively passaged P7 ACs (expansion factor of 85,000), which are typically highly dedifferentiated, were able to form constructs with properties similar to or higher than those formed by lower passage number cells. This study not only demonstrated that post-expansion aggregate culture could significantly improve the properties of self-assembled neocartilage, but also that chondrocytes of exceedingly high passage numbers, expanded using the methods in this study, could be used in cartilage engineering applications.This work demonstrated that extensively passaged chondrocytes (up to passage 7 (P7); expansion factor of 85,000) could potentially be used for cartilage tissue engineering applications. Specifically, an aggregate culture step, employed after cell expansion and before cell integration into a neocartilage construct, was shown to enhance the ability of the chondrocytes to form neocartilage with better biochemical and biomechanical properties. The beneficial effects of this aggregate culture step was especially noticeable at the high passage numbers. Most interestingly, P7 chondrocytes, which are typically highly dedifferentiated, were able to form neocartilage with properties similar to or higher than those formed by lower passage number cells. The ability to obtain high chondrocyte yields with an enhanced chondrogenic potential could have a broad, beneficial impact in improving current therapies (e.g., using higher cell seeding densities for repair) or developing new strategies that require high cell numbers, such as a scaffold-free approach in forming engineered cartilage.",0

The hypothesis was that they support chondrogenesis. A biodegradable, highly porous polycaprolactone-grate was produced by solid freeform fabrication. The polycaprolactone support was coated with a chitosan/polyethylene oxide nanofibre sheet produced by electrospinning. Transforming growth factor-β3-induced chondrogenesis was followed using the following markers: sex determining region Y/-box 9, runt-related transcription factor 2 and collagen II and X in quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, histology and immunostaining. A polycaprolactone-grate and an optimized chitosan/polyethylene oxide nanofibre sheet supported cellular aggregation, chondrogenesis and matrix formation. In tissue engineering constructs, the sheets were seeded first with mesenchymal stem cells and then piled up according to the lasagne principle. The advantages of such a construct are (1) the cells do not need to migrate to the tissue engineering construct and therefore pore size and interconnectivity problems are omitted and (2) the cell-tight nanofibre sheet and collagen-fibre network mimic a cell culture platform for mesenchymal stem cells/chondrocytes (preventing escape) and hinders in-growth of fibroblasts and fibrous scarring (preventing capture).

Ideally, the animal model should allow for testing of clinically relevant treatments and the biological response should be reproducible and comparable to humans. This allows for a reliable translation of results to clinical studies.This study aimed at verifying the Göttingen minipig as a pre-clinical model for articular cartilage repair by testing existing clinical cartilage repair techniques and evaluating the use of two defects per knee.Sixteen fully mature Göttingen minipigs were used. The minipigs received bilateral trochlear osteochondral drill-hole defects or chondral defects (Ø 6 mm), either one defect per knee or two defects per knee. The defects were treated with one of the following: Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI), microfracture (MFx), autologous-dual-tissue transplantation (ADTT), autologous bone graft, autologous cartilage chips. Empty chondral and osteochondral defects were used as controls. MRI and CT were performed 3 and 6 month, histology was performed 6 month postoperative.The repair tissue varied in morphology from non-cartilaginous fibrous tissue to fibrocartilaginous tissue as seen on MRI, CT and histology at 6 month. The worst results were seen in the empty controls, while the best results were achieved with the MACI and ADTT treatment. The use of two defects per knee did not have any significant effect on the repair response.The outcomes of the applied treatments were consistent with the outcomes in clinical studies and it was possible to apply two defects per knee. The Göttingen minipig model was easy to handle, cost-effective and provided predictable outcome.

SF-MSCs at passage 2 (P2) were characterized by flow cytometry for epitope profiling. SF-MSCs at P2 were subsequently cultured in vitro to assess their multilineage potentials. To assess their chondrogenicity, SF-MSCs at P4 were seeded in collagen sponges for 4 weeks under various oxygen tensions and growth factors combinations to estimate their gene profile and matrix production. Also, SF-MSCs were injected into the joints in a nude rat anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) to macroscopically and histologically assess their possible chondroprotective properties,.We characterized the stemness (CD73+, CD90+, CD105+, CD34-, CD45-) and demonstrated the multilineage potency of SF-MSCs in vitro. Furthermore, the chondrogenic induction (TGF-ß1 ± BMP-2) of these SF-MSCs in collagen sponges demonstrated a good capacity of chondrogenic gene induction and extracellular matrix synthesis. Surprisingly, hypoxia did not enhance matrix synthesis, although it boosted chondrogenic gene expression (ACAN, SOX9, COL2A1). Besides, intra-articular injections of xenogenic SF-MSCs did exert neither chondroprotection nor inflammation in ACLT-induced OA in the rat knee.Advanced OA SF-MSCs seem better candidates for cell-based constructs conceived for cartilage defects rather than intra-articular injections for diffuse OA.",0

Comparison of morphological, histological and mechanical performance of the repair tissue was made with defects repaired using a synthetic polymer scaffold. Defects were created in the medial femoral condyle (MFC) and lateral trochlear sulcus (LTS) of Boer Cross goats and evaluated at 12 and 26weeks. It was found that the total histology score of the collagen–GAG based biomaterial (23.8; SD 1.7) provided a significant improvement (p<0.05) over the biphasic PLGA material (19;3) and the empty control defect (17.3;1.2) in the LTS. The overall trajectory of histological and morphological improvement between 12 and 26weeks was found to be higher for the collagen–GAG scaffold compared to the PLGA material. The occurrence of sub-chondral bone cysts was lower for the collagen–GAG scaffold with an incidence of 17% of defects, compared to 67% for the PLGA material at 26weeks. The cartilage repair tissue for both materials evaluated was superior after 26weeks implantation than the empty control with 75% of the collagen-GAG-treated defects showing markedly more hyaline-like cartilage and 50% of the PLGA sites exhibiting hyaline-like appearances, compared to 17% for the empty control. These early stage data indicate biphasic scaffolds based on collagen–GAG and PLGA both provide indications of satisfactory development of a structural repair to surgically prepared osteochondral defects. Furthermore, the biomaterial composition of the collagen–GAG may provide a more favourable environment for osteochondral repair.",0

New surgical treatment options are now available to treat this clinical entity. Diagnosis is made easier by improved magnetic resonance imaging protocols that better visualize articular cartilage. On physical examination, patients at any age can have joint surface damage and primarily experience joint line tenderness and pain with activity. Treatment options include debridement of nonviable cartilage with abrasion or microfracture of the subchondral bone, transplantation of autologous osteochondral plugs, autologous chondrocyte transplantation, transplantation of cadaveric allogenic osteochondral grafts, and, for irreparable damage, total knee arthroplasty. These newer treatment options show promising early and intermediate results.",0

The microstructure and mechanical properties of porous PLGA and porous Ti and their interface were characterized. The as-prepared biphasic scaffolds were implanted into rabbit knees for 1 and 3 months (PLGA/Ti group), and the porous PLGA (PLGA group) or empty defect (Untreated group) was also used. The results showed that both porous PLGA and porous Ti had an interconnected porous structure. The mechanical strength of porous PLGA and porous Ti was similar to that of cartilage and subchondral bone, respectively. The interface analysis revealed that the as-prepared biphasic scaffold had good overall integrity and interface stability. The gross observation and histological evaluation of specimens showed that hyaline-like cartilage filled the defects to a certain extent at 3 months for both PLGA/Ti and PLGA groups while the defects remained in an untreated group. In the PLGA/Ti group, better cartilage and subchondral bone repair was observed, and quantitative macroscopic and histological score evaluations confirmed this result, indicating that the porous biphasic PLGA/Ti scaffold had good biocompatibility and the best osteochondral defect repair ability in this study. The as-prepared porous biphasic scaffold showed the potential to be used in osteochondral tissue engineering for osteochondral defect repair.",0

All English language studies that assessed the outcomes of a surgical technique for the treatment of articular cartilage lesions in football players' knees, with a minimum follow-up of 12 months, were included. The reference list of the most relevant papers was screened. The main outcomes of interest were the clinical, arthroscopy or imaging primary outcomes and the return to sports rate. The methodological and reporting qualities were assessed according to Coleman methodology score.The search provided 485 titles and abstracts. Five studies were eligible for inclusion (mean Coleman score of 37.2 points), comprising a total of 183 football players with a mean age of 25.7 years. A total of 217 articular cartilage and/or osteochondral lesions were reported, where the medial and lateral femoral condyles were the most common sites of lesion. The surgical procedures investigated were mosaicplasty, microfracture, autologous chondrocyte implantation, and chondral debridement.No definitive conclusion could be made in respect to the best current surgical technique for articular cartilage and osteochondral lesions. Microfracture and mosaicplasty can provide a faster return to competition and faster clinical and functional results, whereas autologous chondrocyte implantation and/or matrix-induced autologous chondrocytes implantation procedures can enhance longstanding clinical and functional results.Level IV, systematic review of Level III and IV studies.",0

This is likely related to the more complex morphology and biomechanics of the joint. While previous studies have evaluated cartilage surface matching and congruence, little work has been done to study the associated subchondral bone congruency in these grafts.To determine if differences in patellar morphology play a role in the alignment of the donor patellar osteochondral allograft subchondral bone with the native patellar subchondral bone.Controlled laboratory study.A total of 20 (10 Wiberg I and 10 Wiberg II/III) fresh-frozen human patellae were designated as recipients and size-matched to both a Wiberg I and a Wiberg II/III patellar donor. A 16-mm osteochondral allograft transplant to the central ridge of the patella was performed in random order with each matched donor. Transplanted patellae underwent a nano-computed tomography (nano-CT) scan, were digitally reconstructed, and were superimposed on the initial nano-CT scan of the native recipient patella. MATLAB was used to determine the surface height deviation between the native and donor subchondral bone surfaces. DragonFly 3-dimensional imaging software was used to measure subchondral bone step-off heights at the native-donor interface. Differences between matched and unmatched grafts were compared using a 2-way analysis of variance and the Sidak post hoc test.Subchondral bone surface deviation did not differ between Wiberg matched and unmatched allografts. The step-off height was significantly greater in unmatched (1.38 ± 0.49 mm) compared with matched (1.14 ± 0.52 mm) plugs (P = .015). The lateral quadrant step-off differed between matched (0.89 ± 0.43 mm) and unmatched (1.60 ± 0.78 mm) grafts (P = .007).While unmatched Wiberg patellar osteochondral allograft implantation did not result in significantly different subchondral bone surface height deviations, there was a significant difference in the circumferential subchondral bone step-off height in the lateral quadrant. Further investigation using finite element analysis modeling will help determine the role of subchondral bone surface on shear and compression force distributions in these areas.Given that subchondral bone stiffness and morphology play a role in cartilage health, subchondral bone congruency may play a role in graft survival. Understanding how this congruency plays a role in cartilage force distribution will help surgeons improve the long-term success of osteochondral allograft transplants.",0

Compared with articular chondrocytes, chondrocytes derived from the nasal septum have superior and more reproducible capacity to generate hyaline-like cartilage tissues, with the plasticity to adapt to a joint environment. We aimed to assess whether engineered autologous nasal chondrocyte-based cartilage grafts allow safe and functional restoration of knee cartilage defects.In a first-in-human trial, ten patients with symptomatic, post-traumatic, full-thickness cartilage lesions (2-6 cm2) on the femoral condyle or trochlea were treated at University Hospital Basel in Switzerland. Chondrocytes isolated from a 6 mm nasal septum biopsy specimen were expanded and cultured onto collagen membranes to engineer cartilage grafts (30 × 40 × 2 mm). The engineered tissues were implanted into the femoral defects via mini-arthrotomy and assessed up to 24 months after surgery. Primary outcomes were feasibility and safety of the procedure. Secondary outcomes included self-assessed clinical scores and MRI-based estimation of morphological and compositional quality of the repair tissue. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01605201. The study is ongoing, with an approved extension to 25 patients.For every patient, it was feasible to manufacture cartilaginous grafts with nasal chondrocytes embedded in an extracellular matrix rich in glycosaminoglycan and type II collagen. Engineered tissues were stable through handling with forceps and could be secured in the injured joints. No adverse reactions were recorded and self-assessed clinical scores for pain, knee function, and quality of life were improved significantly from before surgery to 24 months after surgery. Radiological assessments indicated variable degrees of defect filling and development of repair tissue approaching the composition of native cartilage.Hyaline-like cartilage tissues, engineered from autologous nasal chondrocytes, can be used clinically for repair of articular cartilage defects in the knee. Future studies are warranted to assess efficacy in large controlled trials and to investigate an extension of indications to early degenerative states or to other joints.Deutsche Arthrose-Hilfe.",0

Recently improved approaches and tissue-engineered cell constructs have been developed for growing patient populations. We developed a chondrocyte construct using a collagen gel and sponge scaffold and physicochemical stimuli, implanted with a surgical adhesive. We conducted a proof-of-concept study of these improvements using a cartilage defect model in miniature swine. Design We implanted the autologous chondrocyte constructs into full-thickness chondral defects in the femoral condyle, compared those results with empty and acellular scaffold controls, and compared implantation techniques with adhesive alone and with partial adhesive with suture. Two weeks after the creation of the defects and implantation of the cellular or acellular constructs, we arthroscopically confirmed that the implanted constructs remained at the chondral defects. We evaluated the regenerated tissue macro- and microscopically 6 months after the cell constructs were implanted. The tissues were stained with Safranin-O and evaluated using Sellers’ histology grading system. Results The defects implanted with processed cell constructs and acellular scaffolds were filled with chondrocyte-like round cells and with nearly normal tissue architecture that were significantly greater degree compared to empty defect control. Even with the adhesive alone and with suture alone, the cell construct was composed of the dense cartilaginous matrix that was found in the implantation using both the sutures and the adhesive. Conclusion Implantation of cell constructs promoted regeneration and integration of articular cartilage at chondral defects in swine by 6 months.",0

In the literature, there is lack of evidence about the appropriate treatment in cases of failure of these procedures. A technique of osteochondral autologous transplantation of talar graft was used. It was hypothesized that this is a successful method with good results and low complication rates. Additionally, a technique of anterior ankle approach with temporary removal of a bone block from the distal tibia that gives adequate access to posterior talar dome lesions is demonstrated. Between 2004 and 2007, 46 patients (37 males, 9 females), with OLT for which arthroscopic treatment with curettage and drilling or microfracture had failed, underwent osteochondral transplantation with an osteochondral graft harvested from the ipsilateral talar articular facet. A medial malleolar osteotomy or a distal tibial wedge osteotomy was used to access the talar dome defect. The median follow-up time was 5.5 years (range 52-75 m). Thirty-four lesions (70.8 %) were located in the central talar dome in the coronal plane, while 26 (54.1 %) and 19 (39.5 %) lesions were located in the lateral and medial aspect of talar dome in saggital plane, respectively. The overall improvement between the preoperative and post-operative AOFAS and VAS FA score was 35 points (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001) and 39 points (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001), respectively. Clinical results were considered as good in 43 patients (93.4 %) and fair in three patients (6.5 %). All the transplanted grafts were observed to incorporate fully into the recipient bed. No complications occurred at the site of the malleolus osteotomy or tibial osteotomy and the donor site at the talus. The midterm results suggest that the technique of osteochondral transplantation of autologous talar graft for osteochondral lesions of talus after failure of primary treatment with bone marrow stimulation can be safely and successfully used. It demonstrates excellent post-operative scores including improvement of pain and function. This procedure is combined with removal of a tibial bone block and its subsequent replacement and does not yield complications experienced with other procedures.

We also evaluated the cartilage repair response to six smaller microdrill holes compared with two larger holes. Bilateral knee trochlear cartilage defects were created in n=8 skeletally mature rabbits, drilled with six proximal 0.5 mm and two distal 0.9 mm holes, then covered with in situ-solidified IIa-implants (treated) or with IIa-alone (control). After 6.5 months of repair, cartilage repair tissues were analyzed by histological scoring and histomorphometry for hyaline matrix characteristics and osseous integration. Subchondral repair bone was analyzed by 3D microcomputed tomography and compared to acute defects (n=6) and intact trochlea (n=8). Implant-treated cartilage repair tissues had higher structural integrity through the entire defect (p=0.02), twofold higher percent staining for glycosaminoglycan (p=0.0004), and ~24% more collagen type II staining over the smaller drill holes (p=0.008) compared with controls. Otherwise, hole diameter had no specific effect on cartilage repair. The subchondral bone plate was partially restored in treated and control defects but less dense than intact trochlea, with evidence of incomplete regeneration of the calcified cartilage layer. More residual drill holes (p=0.054) were detected in control versus treated defects, and control defects with more than 40% residual holes presented abnormally thicker trabeculae compared with treated defects. Low osteoclast numbers after 6.5 months repair suggested that bone was no longer remodeling. The subchondral bone plate surrounding the defects exhibited a significant thickening compared with age-matched intact trochlea. These data suggest that debridement and drilling can lead to long-term subchondral bone changes outside the cartilage defect. Compared with drilled controls, chitosan implants solidified with thrombin elicited a more hyaline and structurally integrated osteochondral unit, features needed for long-term durability.",0

Surgical options include drilling, microfracturing, and transplantation of osteochondral plugs but are often insufficient for the treatment of large defects of the femoral condyle. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Large osteochondral defects of the femoral condyle (mean defect size 7.2 cm(2) range 3-20) were treated by transplantation of the autologous posterior femoral condyle. Between 1984 and 2000, 29 patients were operated on: in 22 the medial, in 6 the lateral femoral condyle, and in one the trochlear groove was grafted. Thirteen patients underwent simultaneous high tibial valgus osteotomy. In the first series (1984-1999) the graft was temporarily fixed with a screw ( n=12), but from 1999 we used a newly developed press-fit technique ( n=17) avoiding screw fixation of the graft. The operative technique comprising graft harvest, defect preparation, transplantation, and fixation is described. Patients were clinically evaluated using the Lysholm score, and magnetic resonance imaging with intravenous contrast was performed 6 and 12 weeks after surgery (mean follow-up 17.7 months (range 3-46). RESULTS: Pain and swelling were reduced in 26 patients. Three patients of the first series reported persistent problems and were subjectively not satisfied. The mean Lysholm score rose from preoperatively 52 to 77 points after 3 months, 74 after 6, 88 after 12, and 95 after 18. Magnetic resonance imaging showed good graft viability in all cases. We saw one arthrofibrosis after 6 months but noted no problems related to the loss of the missing posterior condyle. CONCLUSION: Large osteochondral defects of the femoral condyle can be treated by transplantation of the autologous posterior femoral condyle. The use of only one osteochondral piece renders better approximation of the femoral cartilage curvature and thus joint congruence than in mosaic plasty. However, whether loss of the posterior condyle has a long-term negative impact on the knee joint remains to be elucidated.",0

This evaluation included studies in pediatric and adult patients with grade 3 or 4 articular cartilage injuries; the studies had a minimum of 25 patients and at least 12 months of follow-up and compared osteochondral autograft transfers/mosiacplasty with another treatment modality. Articles were limited to full-text randomized controlled trials or cohort studies. Main outcomes studied were patient-reported and functional outcome, with secondary outcomes including effect of lesion size, return to sport and sport function, radiographic outcomes, and reoperation rates.There were a total of 9 studies with 607 patients studied in this systematic review. When osteochondral autologous transfer/mosaicplasty (OATM) was compared with microfracture (MF), patients with OATM had better clinical results, with a higher rate of return to sport and maintenance of their sports function from before surgery. Meanwhile, patients who underwent MF trended toward more reoperations, with deterioration around 4 years after surgery. When compared with autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), clinical outcome improvement was not conclusive; however, at 10-year follow-up, a greater failure rate was found to be present in the OATM group.Current evidence shows improved clinical outcomes with OATM when compared with preoperative conditions. These patients were able to return to sport as early as 6 months after the procedure. It could be suggested from the data that OATM procedures might be more appropriate for lesions that are smaller than 2 cm(2) with the known risk of failure between 2 and 4 years. Further high-quality prospective studies into the management of these articular cartilage injuries are necessary to provide a better framework within which to target intervention.Level II, systematic review of Level I and II studies.",0

OC tissue from the sheep femur were obtained and decellularized. The decellularized ECM (dECM) was combined with either platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), amniotic membrane extract (AME), or rabbit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (rBMSCs). The hybrid dECM-biological products were then utilized for the treatment of rabbit OC critical size defects. The regenerative potential of different groups was compared using; MRI, macroscopic assessment, histopathology, and histomorphometry. All characterizations analysis verified successful decellularization. Three months post-surgery, macroscopic findings indicated that dECM was better compared to controls. Also, dECM in combination with AME, PRF, and rBMSCs showed enhanced OC regeneration compared to only dECM (AME: +100%, PRF: +61%, rBMSCs: +28%). In particular, the dECM+AME group results in the best integration of new cartilage into surrounding cartilage tissue. The histomorphometric evaluations demonstrated enhancement in new cartilage formation and bone tissue (86.5 ± 5.9% and 90 ± 7.7%, respectively) for the dECM+AME group compared to other groups. Furthermore, histological results for the dECM+AME elucidated a mature hyaline cartilage tissue that covered the new and symmetrically formed subchondral bone, exhibiting a significantly higher regenerative effect compared to all other treated groups. This finding was also confirmed with MRI images. The current study revealed that in addition to the benefits of dECM alone, its combination with AME indicated to have a superior regenerative effect on OC regeneration. Overall, dECM+AME may be considered a suitable construct for treating knee OC injuries.",0

Femoral medial closing wedge osteotomy for the correction of valgus malalignment to unload the cartilage in the lateral compartment and/or correction of symptomatic torsional malalignment. Indications. Lateral unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee with genu valgum in young patients. Symptomatic torsional malalignement of \textbackslashtextgreater 30 degrees and \textbackslashtextless 0 degrees. Contraindications. Grade 3 and 4 cartilage damage in the medial compartment. Heavy smoking. Medial meniscectomy. Extreme obesity. Inadequate soft tissue conditions. Surgical technique. The operation begins with arthroscopy of the knee joint. In case of grade 4 lateral cartilage damage, a microfracture is performed. The distal femur is exposed via an anteromedial longitudinal incision starting 10 cm above the patella and ending in the upper third of the patella. The medial femoral cortex is exposed using Hohmann retractors and an oblique closing wedge osteotomy is performed with an oscillating saw. In case of valgus correction, the lateral cortex is left intact. In case of correction of torsional malalignment, the osteotomy plane is horizontal and the lateral cortex is cut. The wedge height is determined preoperatively based on full leg x-rays. The leg axis is controlled intraoperatively with a long metal rod and the use of an image intensifier. The osteotomy is manually closed and stabilized with a locking plate. Postoperative management. The patient is mobilized under load with 20 kg body weight for the first 6 postoperative weeks. Full range of motion is permitted. Results. We treated 23 patients with lateral cartilage damage (grades 3 and 4) and genu valgum with medial closing osteotomy of the distal femur (6 men and 17 women).

Frequently lesions are located on the medial femoral condyle (MFC), and typical donor locations for osteochondral grafts include the medial and lateral patellar groove. This technique provides good results, even when the quality of cartilage transplanted from an osteoarthritic joint is doubtful. This study characterizes biological, biomechanical and histological properties of cartilage explants from the patellar groove harvested from osteoarthritic joints. Materials and methods Cylindrical cartilage explants were harvested from the arthritic areas of the MFC as well as normal appearing regions of the medial and lateral patellar groove from porcine joints revealing various grades of osteoarthritis. Matrix synthesis rates were determined, and explants were investigated by mechanical testing and histology. Results Articular cartilage obtained from the typical donor areas of the medial and lateral patellar groove provided constant enhanced material properties, matrix synthesis rates and histological appearance compared to samples from the arthritic lesions of the MFC, even in joints with end-stage osteoarthritis of the MFC. No significant difference was found between patellar groove cartilage samples harvested from joints with different stages of osteoarthritis. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that healthy appearing cartilage from the patellar groove does not undergo significant alterations in material properties due to the arthritic milieu present in osteoarthritic joints. Accordingly these locations provide a source of functional tissue for transplant procedures even in joints with end-stage osteoarthritis.",0

This technical note describes consensus recommendations of the international advisory board for the technique of arthroscopic delivery of the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implant.Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation can be further improved by arthroscopic delivery that does not require special instrumentation. In principle, arthroscopic versus open procedures of delivery of the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implant are less invasive and may potentially result in less postoperative pain, less surgical site morbidity, and faster surgical recovery. Long-term studies are needed to confirm these assumptions as well as the efficacy and safety of this arthroscopic approach.",0

Electronic databases from January 1966 to December 2006 were systematically screened. The proportion of the patient population treated successfully was noted, and percentages were calculated. For each treatment strategy, study size weighted success rates were calculated. Fifty-two studies described the results of 65 treatment groups of treatment strategies for OCD of the talus. One randomized clinical trial was identified. Seven studies described the results of non-operative treatment, 4 of excision, 13 of excision and curettage, 18 of excision, curettage and bone marrow stimulation (BMS), 4 of an autogenous bone graft, 2 of transmalleolar drilling (TMD), 9 of osteochondral transplantation (OATS), 4 of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), 3 of retrograde drilling and 1 of fixation. OATS, BMS and ACI scored success rates of 87, 85 and 76%, respectively. Retrograde drilling and fixation scored 88 and 89%, respectively. Together with the newer techniques OATS and ACI, BMS was identified as an effective treatment strategy for OCD of the talus. Because of the relatively high cost of ACI and the knee morbidity seen in OATS, we conclude that BMS is the treatment of choice for primary osteochondral talar lesions. However, due to great diversity in the articles and variability in treatment results, no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Further sufficiently powered, randomized clinical trials with uniform methodology and validated outcome measures should be initiated to compare the outcome of surgical strategies for OCD of the talus.",0

Ten knees of 10 patients were studied. The signal intensities of reparative and normal cartilage were evaluated by fat-suppressed three-dimensional spoiled-gradient recalled (FS 3D-SPGR) MR imaging. The signal intensity (SI) index (signal intensity of reparative cartilage divided by that of normal cartilage) was defined and the change in SI index was investigated. Histological and biochemical evaluation was done at the second look arthroscopy. The SI index was at its lowest level immediately after ACI and increased with time to 9 months thereafter. After 9-12 months, the SI index settled to almost level and was maintained at that value for at least 2-3 years postoperatively. The average of the SI indexes after 12 months to the last examination was 74.2 +/- 4.6 (range 64.2-82.8), which means signal intensity of reparative cartilage was maintained at a value lower than that of normal cartilage. The total ICRS score was 11.6 +/- 2.3 points (mean +/- SD). The GAG concentration was 107.9 +/- 17.0 microg/mg (mean +/- SD) in normal cartilage and 65.9 +/- 9.4 microg/mg in reparative cartilage. The quality of reparative cartilage as hyaline cartilage was inferior to that of normal cartilage. In the present study, the time course change in the SI index indicates that the major maturation process of implanted chondrocytes neared completion in 9-12 months. Minor changes, such as matrix remodeling with reorganization of the collagen fibers in reparative cartilage, may continue, but an almost identical condition seemed to be maintained during the first 2-3 years of follow-up. SI index does not always reflect all properties of reparative cartilage but may be a useful parameter for noninvasive evaluation.",0

However, most MSCs used in the treatment of RA are modified based on a single gene. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of human BMSCs (hBMSCs) with COX-2 silence and TGF-β3 overexpression in the treatment of RA in a rabbit model.hBMSCs were cotransfected with shCOX-2 and TGF-β3 through lentiviral vector delivery. After SPIO-Molday ION Rhodamine-B™ (MIRB) labeling, lenti-shCOX2-TGF-β3 hBMSCs, lenti-shCOX2 hBMSCs, lenti-TGF-β3 hBMSCs, hBMSCs without genetic modification, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were injected into the knee joint of rabbits with antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). The diameter of the knee joint and soft-tissue swelling score (STS) were recorded, and the levels of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were evaluated by ELISA. Clinical 3.0T MR imaging (MRI) was used to track the distribution and dynamic migration of hBMSCs in the joint. Histopathological and immunohistochemical assays were conducted to localize labeled hBMSCs and assess the alteration of synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, and cartilage damage.COX-2 silencing and TGF-β3 overexpression in hBMSCs were confirmed through real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. Reduced joint diameter, soft-tissue swelling (STS) score, and PGE2, IL-1β, and TNF-α expression were detected 4 weeks after injection of MIRB-labeled lenti-shCOX2-TGF-β3 hBMSCs into the joint in rabbits with AIA. Eight weeks after hBMSC injection, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, improved hyperplasia of the synovial lining, recovered cartilage damage, and increased matrix staining were observed in joints injected with lenti-shCOX2-TGF-β3 hBMSCs and lenti-shCOX2 hBMSCs. Slight synovial hyperplasia, no surface fibrillation, and strong positive expression of collagen II staining in chondrocytes and cartilage matrix were detected in the joints 12 weeks after injection of lenti-shCOX2-TGF-β3 hBMSCs. In addition, hBMSCs were detected by MRI imaging throughout the process of hBMSC treatment.Intra-articular injection of hBMSCs with COX-2 silence and TGFβ3 overexpression not only significantly inhibited joint inflammation and synovium hyperplasia, but also protected articular cartilage at the early stage. In addition, intra-articular injection of hBMSCs with COX-2 silence and TGFβ3 overexpression promoted chondrocyte and matrix proliferation. This study provides an alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of RA using genetically modified hBMSCs.",0

Our ability to heal these defects has been very limited. Microfracture, which is one of the most common attempted surgeries for chondral lesions, has resulted in poor long-term outcomes. Other solutions like allograft osteochondral autograft transfer system, DeNovo, or autologous chondrocyte implantation are more extensive, difficult, expensive surgeries, and are better served for larger lesions. Smaller lesions have shown good short-term outcomes with microfracture but result in creation of fibrocartilage, which is weaker and softer and does not hold up long term. A simple, inexpensive, longer-term solution is needed. BioCartilage is dehydrated, micronized allogeneic cartilage that can be implanted with platelet-rich plasma into these smaller cartilage defects. BioCartilage acts as scaffold, allowing for the creation of hyaline-like cartilage.",0

However, targeted magnetic cell delivery, an emerging technique, may be useful in its treatment. The present study aimed to determine the effect of targeted intra-articular injection of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-labeled adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) in a rabbit model of a massive meniscal defect. ASCs may be directly labeled and almost 100% of the ASCs were labeled with SPIO after 24 h; these SPIO-labeled ASCs may be orientated by magnet. The centrifuged SPIO-labeled ASCs precipitations may be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The anterior half of the medial meniscus of 18 New Zealand Rabbits was excised. After 7 days, the rabbits were randomized to injections of 2×106 SPIO-labeled ASCs, 2×106 unlabeled ASCs or saline. Permanent magnets were fixed to the outside of the operated joints for one day, and after 6 and 12 weeks, the knee joints were examined using MRI, gross and histological observation, and Prussian blue staining. Marked hypointense artifacts caused by SPIO-positive cells in the meniscus were detected using MRI. Histological observation revealed that the anterior portion of the meniscus was similar to the native tissue, demonstrating typical fibrochondrocytes surrounded by richer extracellular matrix in the SPIO-ASCs group. Collagen-rich matrix bridging the interface and the neo-meniscus integrated well with its host meniscus. Furthermore, degenerative changes occurred in all groups, but intra-articular injection of SPIO-ASCs or ASCs alleviated these degenerative changes. Prussian blue staining indicated that the implanted ASCs were directly associated with the regenerated tissue. Overall, targeted intra-articular delivery of SPIO-ASCs promoted meniscal regeneration whilst providing protective effects from osteoarthritic damage.",0

Autologous chondrocyte implantation embedded in scaffolds are used to treat cartilage defects with favorable outcomes. Autologous serum is often used as a medium for chondrocyte cell culture during the proliferation phase of the process of such products. A previous report showed that opiate analgesics (fentanyl, alfentanil and diamorphine) in the sera have a significant inhibitory effect on chondrocyte proliferation. In order to determine if opiates in serum inhibit chondrocyte proliferation, twenty two patients who underwent knee arthroscopy and were anesthetized with either fentanyl or remifentanil were studied. Blood was drawn before and during opiate administration and up to 2 h after its discontinuation. The sera were used as medium for in vitro proliferation of both cryopreserved and freshly isolated chondrocytes, and the number and viability of cells were measured. There was no difference in the yield or cell viability between the serum samples of patients anesthetized with fentanyl when either fresh or cryopreserved human articular chondrocytes (hACs) were used. Some non-significant reduction in the yield of cells was observed in the serum samples of patients anesthetized with remifentanil when fresh hAC were used. We conclude that Fentanyl in human autologous serum does not inhibit in vitro hAC proliferation. Remifentanil may show minimal inhibitory effect on in vitro fresh hAC proliferation.",0

The principle and methods of tissue engineering were used. BMSCs were separated and amplified in vitro, and human transforming growth factor-beta 1 (hTGF-beta 1) gene was transduced to the cells. Then, the cells were suspended in the alginate. At the same time using mosaicplasty to repair the defects on the medial femoral condyle, the dead space between the cylindrical grafts were filled with the gels of hTGF-beta 1 gene transduced BMSCs in alginate. Single mosaicplasty and mosaicplasty associated with the gels of non-gene transduced BMSCs in alginate were compared by the different time observation. All of the three treatments could repair the acute osteochondral defects. Mosaicplasty associated with gene enhanced tissue engineering had a better integration than single mosaicplasty, and mosaicplasty associated with the gels of non-gene transduced BMSCs in alginate. Mosaicplasty associated with tissue engineering could solve the problem of the poor concrescence of the remnant defect and the integration of single mosaicplasty.",0

MRI has become the method of choice for non-invasive follow-up of patients after cartilage repair surgery. It should be performed with cartilage sensitive sequences, including fat-suppressed proton density-weighted T2 fast spin-echo (PD/T2-FSE) and three-dimensional gradient-echo (3D GRE) sequences, which provide good signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios. A thorough magnetic resonance (MR)-based assessment of cartilage repair tissue includes evaluations of defect filling, the surface and structure of repair tissue, the signal intensity of repair tissue and the subchondral bone status. Furthermore, in osteochondral autografts surface congruity, osseous incorporation and the donor site should be assessed. High spatial resolution is mandatory and can be achieved either by using a surface coil with a 1.5-T scanner or with a knee coil at 3 T; it is particularly important for assessing graft morphology and integration. Moreover, MR imaging facilitates assessment of complications including periosteal hypertrophy, delamination, adhesions, surface incongruence and reactive changes such as effusions and synovitis. Ongoing developments include isotropic 3D sequences, for improved morphological analysis, and in vivo biochemical imaging such as dGEMRIC, T2 mapping and diffusion-weighted imaging, which make functional analysis of cartilage possible.",0

The biomechanical stability of a bladelike device that lowers intraosseous stress levels by distributing the load over a greater volume of bone was compared with conventional locking bolts in osteoporotic bone.Standardized simulated comminuted supracondylar femoral fractures (segmental defect) in fresh-frozen paired osteoporotic (bone mineral density <200 milligrams per cubic centimeter) human cadaveric femurs were stabilized with a retrograde unreamed distal femoral nail and distally interlocked with conventional locking bolts or a bladelike device. The distal portions of the fixator-bone constructs were tested under axial load, and the stiffness and strength were compared (pairwise).Interlocking with a bladelike device was 41 percent stiffer (p = 0.01) and 20 percent stronger (p = 0.02) than that with conventional locking bolts. All posttesting radiographs showed compaction of the cancellous bone distal to the interlocking devices. Even after nail displacements of twelve millimeters, only a few locking bolts were plastically deformed and no bladelike device showed gross plastic deformation.This study showed the biomechanical benefits of increasing the bone-implant interface surface for improving the acute stiffness and strength of fracture fixation in osteoporotic cancellous bone. The fixator-bone construct withstood higher forces before failure in these fragile bones.",0

We present the indications, operative technique, and results for the combined operation of high tibial osteotomy and cruciate ligament reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 1996 until December 2000, 58 patients (average age: 33 years) underwent simultaneous osteotomy (57 correcting valgus, 1 valgus malalignment) and cruciate ligament reconstruction (49 ACL, 7 PCL, 2 ACL & PCL) which was routinely performed with an arthroscopic technique after completion of the osteotomy (closed wedge technique). Average correction angle of the osteotomy was 7 degrees (4-10 degrees) with a mean malalignment of 5 degrees (0-10 degrees). Thirteen patients underwent additional cartilage surgery (osteochondral autograft transplantation, autologous chondrocyte transplantation, microfracturing), and two patients were implanted with a collagen meniscus (CMI) at the same time. RESULTS: Preoperatively the Lysholm score was 66 (35-81) points and increased to 81 (74-95), 87 (79-99), and 93 (88-99) points 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, respectively. Subjectively all patients reported an improvement of preoperative swelling, pain, and instability. Additional cartilage surgery or meniscus implantation did not significantly alter the clinical score values. Complications were noted in four patients. CONCLUSIONS: Unstable knees with varus malalignment can be sufficiently treated by osteotomy and cruciate ligament reconstruction at the same time, suggesting that unicompartimental decompression and treatment of instability is a causal and cost-effective therapy delaying the progression of osteoarthritis and minimizing clinical symptoms. Performing both operations in one procedure facilitates early rehabilitation and the return of these patients to the activities of daily living and sports.",0

We present preliminary data on a combined autologous bone and cartilage chips: autologous dual-tissue transplantation (ADTT); an easily applicable, low-cost treatment option for osteochondral repair. The aim of this study was to investigate the early biological and clinical outcome of ADTT.Eight patients (age 32 ± 7.5 years) suffering from osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) in the knee were enrolled. The OCD lesion was debrided and the osteochondral defect was filled with autologous bone, to a level at the base of the adjacent cartilage. Cartilage biopsies from the intercondylar notch were chipped and embedded within fibrin glue in the defect. Evaluation was performed using magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and clinical scores, preoperative and 1 year postoperative.Cartilage tissue repair evaluated using MOCART score improved from 22.5 to 52.5 (P < 0.01). Computed tomography imaging demonstrated very good subchondral bone healing with all 8 patients having a bone filling of >80%. We found improvements 1 year postoperative in the International Knee Documentation Committee score (from 35.9 to 68.1, P < 0.01), Tegner score (from 2.6 to 4.7, P < 0.05), and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score pain, symptoms, sport/recreation and quality of life (P < 0.05).Treatment of OCD with ADTT resulted in very good subchondral bone restoration and good cartilage repair.

The repair tissue was described with separate variables: degree of defect repair in width and length, surface, structure and signal intensity of the repair tissue, and status of the subchondral lamina and bone. For these variables, a grading system with point-scale evaluation was applied, and the mean average values were calculated for every follow-up MR exam of each patient.In 10 patients, an incomplete filling of the defect improved to complete filling (6 patients) or less incomplete (4 patients) filling of the defect. Three cases of implant hypertrophy returned to normal within 1 year. Complete filling of the defect by repair tissue was found in 2 patients from the beginning. Integration was complete in 10 cases. Improvement of incomplete to complete integration was found in 3 patients. The signal intensity of the implant developed to native cartilage signal in 13 patients.

Although recent studies have reported the successful treatment of articular defects in the knee and ankle joints with this surgical procedure, little attention has been given to the surgical efficacy of mosaicplasty in the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum. Purpose To clarify the clinical outcomes of mosaicplasty for teenaged patients with advanced lesions of capitellar osteochondritis dissecans. Study Design Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods Eight teenaged patients with advanced lesions of capitellar osteochondritis dissecans underwent mosaicplasties. All patients were baseball players who were affected on the right side, which was also their throwing side. The surgical technique involves obtaining small-sized cylindrical osteochondral grafts from the lateral periphery of the femoral condyles and transplanting them to prepared osteochondral defects. At a mean follow-up of 24 months, all patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically. Results Seven of the 8 patients were free from elbow pain, and the remaining patient had mild pain occasionally. The mean clinical score described by Timmerman and Andrews (a maximum of 200 points) significantly improved from 140 points to 183 points postoperatively. All patients except one had excellent or good clinical results. Radiographically, the graft incorporation and a normal contour of the subchondral cortex were found in all patients. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the preoperative heterogeneity of the lesion had disappeared and the signal intensity returned to normal. Six of the 8 patients, including all 3 pitchers, returned to competitive-level baseball. Conclusion Mosaicplasty for advanced lesions of capitellar osteochondritis dissecans in teenaged baseball players can provide satisfactory clinical and radiographic results.",0

MSCs were cultured in PLLA films and thin porous membranes to study adherence and proliferation. Permeability and porosity were determined for the different scaffolds employed. The optimal conditions for cell seeding were first determined, as well as cell density and distribution inside the PLLA. Scaffolds were then maintained in expansion or chondrogenic differentiation media for 21 days. Apoptosis, proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation was assessed after 21 days in culture by immunohistochemistry. Mechanical characteristics of scaffolds were determined before and after cell seeding. MSCs uniformly adhered to PLLA films as well as to porous membranes. Proliferation was detected only in monolayers of pure PLLA, but was no longer detected after 10 days. Mechanical characterization of PLLA scaffolds showed differences in the apparent compression elastic modulus for the two sizes used. After determining high efficiencies of seeding, the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) was determined and contained aggrecan and collagens type I and X. ECM produced by the cells induced a twofold increase in the apparent elastic modulus of the composite. Biocompatible PLLA scaffolds have been developed that can be efficiently loaded with MSCs. The scaffold supports chondrogenic differentiation and ECM deposition that improves the mechanics of the scaffold. Although this improvement does not met the expectations of a hyaline-like cartilage ECM, in part due to the lack of a mechanical stimulation, their potential use in the treatment of cartilage pathologies encourages to improve the mechanical component.",0

Methods A systematic review of the literature in Medline (Pubmed) and Embase was performed using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Articles which reported the post-operative MRI morphological outcomes following the use of third-generation ACI for treatment of knee cartilage lesions were included. All MRI results were allocated to six different time intervals: \textbackslashtextless= 3 months, \textbackslashtextgreater 3-6 months, \textbackslashtextgreater 6 months-1 year, \textbackslashtextgreater 1 year-2 years, \textbackslashtextgreater 2-5 years and \textbackslashtextgreater 5 years after surgery. Results A total of 22 studies were included and the study populations ranged from 13 to 180 patients adding up to a total of 951 patients. Parameters such as defect fill, border integration, surface contour, graft morphology and integrity of the subchondral lamina all improve gradually with a peak two years following surgery suggesting complete graft maturation at this time point. After this peak, a statistically insignificant decline is noted for most of the parameters. Signal intensity was found to gradually shift from hyperintense to isointense in the first 36 months and to hypointense later on. Contrarily, subchondral bone edema is not only a postoperative feature of the procedure but also can reappear or persist up to ten years after surgery. As graft failures can appear after two years, consequently, the MRI composite score is also affected. Conclusion Recurring patterns in postoperative MRI appearance were observed in certain parameters including defect filling, graft signal intensity and structure, border integration of the graft while parameters like subchondral bone tend to be unpredictable. Given the heterogenous findings in terms of clinical correlation, and relating that aspect to the patterns found in this review, an MRI is justified at three months, one year, two years and five years after surgery, unless the clinical symptomatology and individual patient needs dictate otherwise.",0

All the studies that involved OCT were identified. Only Level I and II studies that compared OCT to other modalities of treatment such as microfracture (MF) and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) were selected.A total of 8 studies matched the selection criteria with 2 Level I and 6 Level II studies. Four studies compared OCT with MF, 3 compared OCT with ACI, and one compared all 3 techniques. Of 3 studies, 4 came from a single center. Mean age of patients ranged from 24 to 33 years, and mean follow-up ranged from 9 to 124 months. The studies from the single center showed superior results from OCT over MF, especially in younger patients, with one study having long-term follow-up of 10 years. They also showed an earlier return to sports. The size of the lesions were small (average < 3 cm(2)). The 4 other independent studies did not show any difference between OCT and ACI, with one study showing inferior outcome in the OCT group. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed good osseous integration of the osteochondral plugs to the subchondral bone. Histologic examination showed that there was hyaline cartilage in the transplanted osteochondral plugs but no hyaline cartilage between the plugs.From the studies of a single center, OCT had an advantage over MF in younger patients with small chondral lesions.

Included studies were evaluated with regard to the level of evidence (LOE) and quality of evidence (QOE) using the Modified Coleman Methodology Score. Variable reporting outcome data, clinical outcomes, and the percentage of patients who returned to sport at previous level were also evaluated.Twenty-eight studies for a total of 897 ankles were included; 96% were either LOE III or IV. Studies were designated as either of poor or fair quality. There were 30 treatment groups reporting six different scaffold repair techniques: 13 matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT), nine bone marrow derived cell transplantation (BMDCT), four autologous matrix-induced chondrogeneis (AMIC), and four studies of other techniques. The categories of general demographics (93%) and patient-reported outcome data (85%) were well reported. Study design (73%), imaging data (73%), clinical variables (49%), and patient history (30%) were also included. The weighted mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score at final follow-up was: 86.7 in MACT, 88.2 in BMDCT, and 82.3 in AMIC. Eight studies reported that a weighted mean of 68.3% of patients returned to a previous level of sport activity.Scaffold-based therapy for OLT may produce favorable clinical outcomes, but low LOE, poor QOE, and variability of the data have confounded the effectiveness of this treatment.",0

If left untreated, such an injury may progress to osteoarthritis, a degenerative and debilitating joint disease characterized by pain and functional impairment. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which have immune-modulatory properties and the ability to differentiate into chondroblasts and osteoblasts, are a predictable source for the treatment of cartilage injuries. This article presents tools to evaluate cartilage restoration by tissue engineering and cell therapy treatment in a translational and preclinical large animal model. In this controlled experimental study with 14 miniature pigs, a scaffold-free tissue engineering construct (TEC) derived from dental pulp and synovial MSCs for cartilage therapy was tested. Total thickness cartilage defects were performed in both posterior knees. The defect was left empty in one of the knees, and the other received the TEC. The tissue repair was morphologically assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the three-dimensional double echo steady-state (3D-DESS) sequence, and compositional assessment was carried out based on the T2 mapping technique. The osteochondral specimens were fixed for histopathology, decalcified, subjected to standard histological processing, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The sections stained for immunohistochemical detection of collagen types were digested with pepsin and chondroitinase and incubated with antibodies against them. The mechanical evaluation involved analysis of Young's modulus of the cartilage samples based on the indentation and maximum compression test. In addition, a finite element model was used to simulate and characterize properties of the osteochondral block. At 6 months after surgery, there were no complications with the animals and the MRI, histological, immunohistochemical, and biomechanical evaluations proved to be effective and qualified to differentiate good quality chondral repair from inadequate repair tissue. The proposed methods were feasible and capable to properly evaluate the defect filled with TEC containing stromal cells after 6 months of follow-up in a large animal model for articular cartilage restoration. Impact Statement Articular chondral injuries are prevalent and represent an economic burden due to the cost of treatment. The engineering of cartilage tissue can promote the repair of chondral injuries and is dependent on selecting appropriate cells and biocompatible frameworks. In this article, methods for evaluation of a scaffold-free cell delivery system made from mesenchymal stromal cells were present in a translational study that allows further clinical safety and efficacy trials.",0

There is a growing interest in the use of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for OA treatment and developing biomimetic injectable hydrogels as cell delivery systems. Biomimetic injectable hydrogels can simulate the native tissue microenvironment by providing appropriate biological and chemical cues for tissue regeneration. A biomimetic injectable hydrogel using amnion membrane (AM) was developed which can self-assemble in situ and retain the stem cells at the target site. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of intraarticular injections of AM hydrogels with and without ADSCs in reducing inflammation and cartilage degeneration in a collagenase-induced OA rat model. A week after the induction of OA, rats were treated with control (phosphate-buffered saline), ADSCs, AM gel, and AM-ADSCs. Inflammation and cartilage regeneration was evaluated by joint swelling, analysis of serum by cytokine profiling and Raman spectroscopy, gross appearance, and histology. Both AM and ADSC possess antiinflammatory and chondroprotective properties to target the sites of inflammation in an osteoarthritic joint, thereby reducing the inflammation-mediated damage to the articular cartilage. The present study demonstrated the potential of AM hydrogel to foster cartilage tissue regeneration, a comparable regenerative effect of AM hydrogel and ADSCs, and the synergistic antiinflammatory and chondroprotective effects of AM and ADSC to regenerate cartilage tissue in a rat OA model.",0

The acute defects were created in the weight-bearing area of the medial femoral condyle of the goats. Mosaicplasty was done to repair the defects. While implanting the cylindrical osteochondral grafts, different osteochondral sunk, or elevated incongruities were created. The goats were killed 12 weeks after operation to receive gross and histology observation, which was evaluated by the histological grading scale of O'Driscoll et al. The specimens were also taken for transmission electron microscope examination. Two factors analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Kewls test were used to compare the specimen. Minimal steps, which were less than the thickness of cartilage, possess a capacity for remodeling that can correct initial incongruities while preserving hyaline characteristics. However, the step more than the thickness of cartilage could not be repaired satisfactorily. The incongruity could have an influence on the repair by the mosaicplasty technique in a goat model. The limited incongruity could be repaired by a vigorous remodeling process.",0

Osteochondral (OC) tissue compromises soft cartilage over hard subchondral bone with a calcified cartilage interface between these two tissues. Osteochondral defects can be caused by numerous factors such as trauma and arthritis. Tissue engineering offers the possibility of a sustainable and effective treatment against osteochondral defects, where the damaged tissue is replaced with a long-lasting bio-manufactured replacement tissue. This review evaluates both bi-phasic and multi-phasic scaffold-based approaches of osteochondral tissue regeneration, highlighting the importance of having an interface layer between the bone and cartilage layer. The significance of a biomimetic approach is also evidenced and shown to be more effective than the more homogenous design approach to osteochondral scaffold design. Recent scaffold materials and manufacturing techniques are reviewed as well as the current clinical progress with osteochondral regeneration scaffolds.",0

Cell tracking can be a major step towards unraveling and improving the repair process of these therapies. We studied superparamagnetic iron oxides (SPIO) for labeling human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) regarding effectivity, cell viability, long term metabolic cell activity, chondrogenic differentiation and hBMSC secretion profile. We additionally examined the capacity of synovial cells to endocytose SPIO from dead, labeled cells, together with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for intra-articular visualization and quantification of SPIO labeled cells.Efficacy and various safety aspects of SPIO cell labeling were determined using appropriate assays. Synovial SPIO re-uptake was investigated in vitro by co-labeling cells with SPIO and green fluorescent protein (GFP). MRI experiments were performed on a clinical 3.0T MRI scanner. Two cell-based cartilage repair techniques were mimicked for evaluating MRI traceability of labeled cells: intra-articular cell injection and cell implantation in cartilage defects. Cells were applied ex vivo or in vitro in an intra-articular environment and immediately scanned. SPIO labeling was effective and did not impair any of the studied safety aspects, including hBMSC secretion profile. SPIO from dead, labeled cells could be taken up by synovial cells. Both injected and implanted SPIO-labeled cells could accurately be visualized by MRI in a clinically relevant sized joint model using clinically applied cell doses. Finally, we quantified the amount of labeled cells seeded in cartilage defects using MR-based relaxometry.SPIO labeling appears to be safe without influencing cell behavior. SPIO labeled cells can be visualized in an intra-articular environment and quantified when seeded in cartilage defects.",0

We explored a novel matrix-based implant cartilage repair composed of both fibrin and hyaluronan in a defined ratio that takes advantage of the biological and mechanical properties of these two elements. The matrix was seeded with autologous chondrocytes expanded in the presence of a proprietary growth factor variant designed to preserve their chondrogenic potential. We prospectively followed eight patients with symptomatic-chronic cartilage defects treated with this carrier. Patients had arthroscopy to harvest autologous chondrocytes then grown in autologous serum. Chondrocytes were cultured in the presence of the FGF variant and then seeded on the fibrin-hyaluronan matrix. About 4 weeks following biopsy, the patients underwent implantation of the constructs by miniarthrotomy. Three of the eight patients had transient effusion. Clinical performance was measured by Lysholm and IKDC scores, MRI, and the need for secondary surgery. The clinical outcome of a 1-year followup demonstrated increase of clinical scores. The MRI followup showed good filling of the defect with tissue having the imaging appearance of cartilage in all patients.

Pure cartilage graft implantation appears to be a simple option, but it has not been applied widely as cartilage will not reattach easily to the subchondral bone.We used a multiple-incision technique (processed chondrograft) to increase cartilage graft surface. We hypothesized that pure cartilage graft with augmented osteochondral fusion capacity may be used for cartilage repair and we compared this method with other repair techniques.Controlled laboratory study.Full-thickness focal cartilage defects were created on the medial femoral condyle of 9-month-old pigs; defects were repaired using various methods including bone marrow stimulation, autologous chondrocyte implantation, and processed chondrograft. After the repair, at weeks 6 and 24, macroscopic and histologic evaluation was carried out.Compared with other methods, processed chondrograft was found to be similarly effective in cartilage repair. Defects without repair and defects treated with bone marrow stimulation appeared slightly irregular with fibrocartilage filling. Autologous chondrocyte implantation produced hyalinelike cartilage, although its cellular organization was distinguishable from the surrounding articular cartilage. Processed chondrograft demonstrated good osteochondral integration, and the resulting tissue appeared to be hyaline cartilage.The applied cartilage surface processing method allows acceptable osteochondral integration, and the repair tissue appears to have good macroscopic and histologic characteristics.If further studies confirm its efficacy, this technique could be considered for human application in the future.",0

Chondral lesions can be caused by metabolic stimulation, or by genetic, vascular and traumatic events, and are classified according to the size and thickness of the affected cartilage. Clinical diagnosis can be difficult, especially due to insidious symptoms. Additional tests, as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), may be needed. The treatment of these lesions usually starts with non-operative management. Surgery should be reserved for patients with detached chondral fragments, blocked range of motion, or the failure of non-operative treatment. The surgical techniques used for the treatment of partial thickness defects are Debridement and Ablation. These techniques aim to improve symptoms, since they do not restore normal structure and function of the cartilage. For full-thickness defects (osteochondral lesion), available treatments are Abrasion, Drilling, Microfracture, Osteochondral Autologous and Allogeneic Transplantation, and biological techniques such as the use of Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation, Minced Cartilage and stem cells.",0

The objectives of this study were (1) to characterize chitosan-GP/blood clots in vitro, and (2) to develop a rabbit marrow stimulation model in order to determine the effects of the chitosan-GP/blood implant and of debridement on the formation of incipient cartilage repair tissue.Blood clots were characterized by histology and in vitro clot retraction tests. Bilateral 3.5 x 4 mm trochlear defects debrided into the calcified layer were pierced with four microdrill holes and filled with a chitosan-GP/blood implant or allowed to bleed freely as a control. At 1 day post-surgery, initial defects were characterized by histomorphometry (n=3). After 8 weeks of repair, osteochondral repair tissues between or through the drill holes were evaluated by histology, histomorphometry, collagen type II expression, and stereology (n=16).Chitosan-GP solutions structurally stabilized the blood clots by inhibiting clot retraction. Treatment of drilled defects with chitosan-GP/blood clots led to the formation of a more integrated and hyaline repair tissue above a more porous and vascularized subchondral bone plate compared to drilling alone. Correlation analysis of repair tissue between the drill holes revealed that the absence of calcified cartilage and the presence of a porous subchondral bone plate were predictors of greater repair tissue integration with subchondral bone (P<0.005), and of a higher total O'Driscoll score (P<0.005 and P<0.01, respectively).Chitosan-GP/blood implants applied in conjunction with drilling, compared to drilling alone, elicited a more hyaline and integrated repair tissue associated with a porous subchondral bone replete with blood vessels. Concomitant regeneration of a vascularized bone plate during cartilage repair could provide progenitors, anabolic factors and nutrients that aid in the formation of hyaline cartilage.",0

The porous PLGA-GCH scaffold was developed to mimic the natural extra cellular matrix of cartilage. The differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seeded on PLGA-GCH or PLGA scaffold were incubated in vitro and showed that, compared to PLGA scaffold, the PLGA-GCH scaffold significantly augmented the proliferation of MSCs and GAG synthesis. Then autologous differentiated MSCs/PLGA-GCH was implanted to repair full-thickness cartilage defect in rabbit, while MSCs/PLGA for the contra lateral cartilage defect (n=30). Fifteen additional rabbits without treatment for defects were used as control. Histology observation showed the MSCs/PLGA-GCH repair group had better chondrocyte morphology, integration, continuous subchondral bone, and much thicker newly formed cartilage compared with MSCs/PLGA repair group 12 and 24 weeks postoperatively. There was a significant difference in histological grading score between these two groups, which both showed much better repair than control.

Cartilage is relatively avascular and is unable to self-repair. A chondral lesion may become symptomatic. It may lead to osteoarthritis and increased morbidity. The aim of cartilage repair is to restore hyaline cartilage. There are many types of cartilage repair surgery, most of which result in fibrocartilage repair tissue that is suboptimal. Autologous chondrocyte implantation has been shown to produce hyaline-type repair tissue. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is performed preoperatively to define the ulcer and postoperatively to evaluate the technical success of implantation and the state of cartilage healing and to identify potential complications. Features of the autologous chondrocyte implantation graft that are assessed include the degree of filling by repair tissue, its integration with native cartilage and subchondral bone, the character of the graft substance and surface, and the underlying bone. MR arthrography is superior to unenhanced MR imaging because intraarticular contrast material allows the recipient site to be physically separated from adjacent structures so that it can be characterized more accurately. MR imaging and arthroscopy are complementary investigations in the follow-up of an autologous chondrocyte implantation in the knee. The appearance of the knee after autologous chondrocyte implantation varies among individuals and according to the time-course of healing. Familiarity with the surgical procedure and imaging appearance is essential for an accurate postsurgical assessment.",0

The natural history of untreated lesions demonstrates progressive degenerative changes and deterioration in functional outcome scores. Medical management, osteotomies, lavage, and debridement procedures temporize symptoms and slow progression. Cartilage restoration procedures such as microfracture and cell-based therapies have shown promise, but there are concerns of the long-term durability of these procedures in the active population. Mosaicplasty allows for restoration of articular defects with hyaline cartilage, and has shown excellent durability. Articular defect should measure between 1 to 4 cm(2) in diameter and extend 10 mm into subchondral bone. Mosaicplasty can be challenging when attempted arthroscopically, and the threshold to convert to an open procedure should be low when adequate visualization is not achieved. Use of variable graft size maximizes defect fill with hyaline cartilage. Avoidance of graft prominence >1 mm and attention to the contour of the joint optimizes the recreation of articular surface. This is achieved by placing central grafts in a large defect slightly prouder to obtain a convex shape to the articular surface. With attention to the nuances of the surgical technique, mosaicplasty offers an excellent option for cartilage restoration in the young active patient.",0

The autologous chondrocytes implantation (ACI) technique has evolved over the past 20 years: the first-generation technique involves the use of a periosteal patch, the second-generation technique (collagen-cover) uses a type I/III collagen membrane, and the newest third-generation technique seeds and cultivates the collagen membrane with chondrocytes prior to implantation and is referred to as matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation. Particulated juvenile allograft cartilage (PJAC) (DeNovo NT) is minced cartilage allograft from juvenile donors. A thorough physical exam is important, especially for issues affecting the PF joint, to isolate the location and source of pain, and to identify associated pathologies. Imaging studies allow further characterization of the lesions and identification of associated pathologies and alignment.

It was hypothesized that both PRP and BMC augmentation will result in improved outcomes in osteochondral knee surgery in both animal and human models.Systematic review.PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase were searched for studies relating to PRP or BMC and treatment of osteochondral defects of the knee, from database inception to February 1, 2020. Included were articles that (1) studied PRP or BMC augmentation; (2) used osteochondral autograft, allograft, or biologic scaffold; and (3) treated osteochondral defects in the knee. Data on use of PRP or BMC, outcomes assessed, and results were recorded for each publication.Of the 541 articles identified initially, 17 were included in the final review. Five articles studied osteochondral grafts in animals, 5 studied biologic scaffolds in animals, and 7 studied scaffolds or allografts in humans; the combined sample size was 202 patients. Of 4 histologic scaffold studies, 3 PRP-augmented scaffold studies identified histologic improvements in regenerated cartilage in animal models, while 1 BMC study demonstrated similar improvement in histologic scores of BMC-augmented scaffolds compared with controls. Three studies associated greater collagen type 2 and glycosaminoglycan content with PRP treatment. Comparative studies found that both augments increase osteogenic proteins, including bone morphogenetic protein-2 and osteoprotegerin. Two of 3 studies on BMC-augmented osteochondral allografts reported no difference in radiographic features postoperatively. Long-term improvement in clinical and radiographic outcomes of PRP-augmented scaffolds was demonstrated in 1 human study.Animal studies suggest that biologics possess potential as adjuncts to surgical treatment of osteochondral knee defects; however, clinical data remain limited.",0

It is often challenging for the surgeon to choose among a growing menu of treatment options. To ensure appropriate product selection, the surgeon must have a firm understanding of the evolving Food and Drug Administration regulatory pathways, insurance medical policies, and must also be well versed on basic science and clinical evidence in support of the product. Depending on the required Food and Drug Administration pathway, available products range from loosely regulated (animal studies and limited clinical data) to tightly controlled (phased randomized control studies). Challenges and limitations are incumbent with products brought to market through either pathway. Therefore, it is important to develop a personal system to evaluate each novel product—as new is not always better. In this article, we provide the framework for evaluation and integration of novel products into cartilage practice. Through case examples, we highlight pearls and pitfalls in the adoption of new technology from a variety of regulatory pathways. Finally, we provide an overview of existing cartilage treatment options and novel products in the approval “pipeline.”",0

Therefore, in this in vitro study, we evaluated the possible benefit of using minced cartilage embedded in a 3-dimensional culture scaffold and fixed with fibrin glue, in comparison with isolated chondrocytes in atelocollagen, to induce cell migration, proliferation, and matrix production, using cartilage from patients with knee joint osteoarthritis.Cartilage fragments were obtained from 7 female patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and embedded in atelocollagen gels. As a control, chondrocytes were isolated and embedded in gels in the same manner. These composites were cultured for 3 weeks, and cell proliferation and matrix production were evaluated using histology and immunochemistry.Histologically, minced cartilage showed cell migration from the cartilage fragments into the gel, with the Bern score and cell count in the minced cartilage group being significantly higher than those in the control group. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the number of Ki67-positive cells, the expression of LECT-1 and TGF-β, and the glycosaminoglycan content were significantly higher in the minced cartilage than in the control group. Minced cartilage exhibited superior cell migration, proliferation, and glycosaminoglycan content than isolated chondrocytes.Our findings support that minced cartilage has a favorable potential for cell proliferation and matrix production compared with the isolated chondrocytes after enzymatic treatment.",0

An osteochondral defect (diameter, 4 mm; depth, 1 mm) was created on the patellar groove of the femur in both legs. The defects were filled with a chondrocyte-seeded scaffold in the right knee and an empty scaffold in the left knee. Five rabbits each were euthanized at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and their knees were examined via macroscopic inspection, histological and biochemical analysis, and quantitative MRI (T2 mapping and dGEMRIC) to assess the state of tissue repair following allograft chondrocyte implantation with a three-dimensional scaffold for osteochondral lesions.Comparatively good regenerative cartilage was observed both macroscopically and histologically. In both chondrocyte-seeded and control knees, the T2 values of repair tissues were highest at 4 weeks and showed a tendency to decrease with time. ΔR1 values of dGEMRIC also tended to decrease with time in both groups, and the mean ΔR1 was significantly lower in the CS-scaffold group than in the control group at all time points. ΔR1 = 1/r (R1post - R1pre), where r is the relaxivity of Gd-DTPA(2-), R1 = 1/T1 (longitudinal relaxation time).T2 mapping and dGEMRIC were both effective for evaluating tissue repair after allograft chondrocyte implantation. ΔR1 values of dGEMRIC represented good correlation with histologically and biochemically even at early stages after the implantation.",0

Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) aims to restore the integrity of isolated cartilage lesions through the induction of hyaline-like cartilage formation. Although ACI has traditionally been used as a second-line treatment, recent evidence suggests that ACI should be considered as a first-line treatment option in certain patients. Recent controlled trials also suggest that there are improved clinical outcomes among those patients who undergo ACI over the mid-term and long-term compared with those treated with microfracture or osteochondral autograft/mosaicplasty, regardless of lesion size. Recent literature also indicates that arthroscopic, second-generation and third-generation techniques are associated with better outcomes and fewer complications than first-generation ACI. In summary, ACI is an effective tool for cartilage restoration that may be more efficacious and durable than other cartilage restoration techniques for appropriate candidates.",0

Damage can insidiously spread and lead to osteoarthritis with significant functional and socioeconomic consequences. Implants consisting of autologous chondrocytes or mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) seeded onto scaffolds have been suggested as promising therapies to restore these defects. However, the degree of integration between the implant and native cartilage still requires optimization. A PRISMA systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using five databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL) to identify studies that used autologous chondrocyte implants (ACI) or MSC implant therapies to repair chondral defects of the tibiofemoral joint. Data on the integration of the implant-cartilage interface, as well as outcomes of clinical scoring systems, were extracted. Most eligible studies investigated the use of ACI only. Our meta-analysis showed that, across a total of 200 patients, 64% (95% CI (51%, 75%)) achieved complete integration with native cartilage. In addition, a pooled improvement in the mean MOCART integration score was observed during post-operative follow-up (standardized mean difference: 1.16; 95% CI (0.07, 2.24), p = 0.04). All studies showed an improvement in the clinical scores. The use of a collagen-based scaffold was associated with better integration and clinical outcomes. This review demonstrated that cell-seeded scaffolds can achieve good quality integration in most patients, which improves over time and is associated with clinical improvements. A greater number of studies comparing these techniques to traditional cartilage repair methods, with more inclusion of MSC-seeded scaffolds, should allow for a standardized approach to cartilage regeneration to develop.",0

The most common treatments to repair chondral and osteochondral lesions are bone marrow stimulation, osteochondral autograft transplantation, autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis, and autologous chondrocyte implantation. We like to emphasize the difference between a chondral and an osteochondral lesion because the difference is sometimes lost in the literature. In the context of treatment of injuries of the knee joint cartilage, the second-generation autologous chondrocyte transplant is a consolidated surgical method alternative to other techniques. Our experience with the transplantation of chondrocytes has had exceptional clinical results. We report 2 complete cases of a group of 22 in knee and ankle. These 2 cases had histological and instrumental evaluation. We cannot express conclusions, but can only make considerations, stating that, with the clinical functional result being equal, we obtained an excellent macroscopic result in both cases of second look. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a multiple surgical procedure with expensive chondrocyte culture, but even with this limitation, we think that it must be the choice in treating chondral lesions, especially in young patients.",0

The distinction between local cartilage defects and large area degenerative cartilage lesions is very important for both prognosis and surgical therapy. The size and position of the lesion, the underlying pathomechanism and the age of the patient are very important factors which should be considered in the therapy algorithm for optimal cartilage defect restoration. Important cofactors such as stability, long leg axis and muscle balance should be taken into account. Current procedures for cartilage repair of the knee joint and their results are summarized in this article. In addition, the necessity of precise and comprehensive preoperative clinical and radiological diagnostics is displayed to be able to treat co-pathologies in order to enable a successful repair of the cartilage defect. Preoperative planning of cartilage-repair techniques usually includes xaEuroray images and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. If MRI is not available, an arthro-computed tomography could be an alternative. Modern and routinely used procedures for cartilage repair at the knee joint are microfracture, autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis, autologous chondrocyte transplantation, matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral transplantation. Successful surgical cartilage-repair surgeries require a correct and individualized indication, addressing of copathologies and a standardized rehabilitation that is adapted to the surgical procedure.

Many novel techniques exist to try and treat this challenging entity. Difficulties associated with treating OCLs include lesion location, size, chronicity, and problems associated with potential graft harvest sites. Matrix-associated stem cell transplantation (MAST) is one such treatment described for larger lesions \textbackslashtextgreater 15 mm(2) or failed alternative therapies. This cohort study describes a 3 year review of the outcomes of talar lesions treated with MAST. Methods A review of all patients treated with MAST by a single surgeon was conducted. Pre-operative radiographs, MRIs, and FAOS outcome questionnaire scores were reviewed. Intraoperative classification was undertaken to correlate with imaging. Post-operative outcomes included FAOS scores, return to sport, revision surgery/failure of treatment, and progression to ankle fusion. Results In this study, 38 OCLs in 32 patients were identified. Median patient age was 35 years of which (68.8%) were male. Median length of follow-up was 36.7 months (range 12-64 months). (83%) returned to playing sport. Twenty-three patients underwent MAST in the setting of a failed previous operative attempt, with just nine having MAST as a first option. Nine patients out of 32 had a further procedure. Improvements were seen in all domains of the FAOS (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05).

We used a commercial harvesting system to transfer an osteochondral plug into a cartilage defect involving the lunate facet of the distal radius. At final follow-up, 34 months after surgery, the patient was assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS) and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores and with a comprehensive physical examination. Magnetic resonance arthrogram was used to assess articular cartilage status. VAS pain score improved from 7 before surgery to 0.5 after surgery. Postoperative DASH score was 0.

A one-step arthroscopic technique is developed for cartilage repair, using a device to concentrate bone marrow-derived cells and collagen powder or hyaluronic acid membrane as scaffolds for cell support and platelet gel.The rationale of the ""one-step technique"" is to transplant the entire bone-marrow cellular pool instead of isolated and expanded mesenchymal stem cells allowing cells to be processed directly in the operating room, without the need for a laboratory phase. For an entirely arthroscopic implantation are employed a scaffold and the instrumentation previously applied for ACI; in addition to these devices, autologous platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is added in order to provide a supplement of growth factors.

Adipose-derived stem cells and possibly other adipose-based therapies have a greater chondrogenic potential than stem cells derived from bone marrow, and thus a lot of attention is being placed on them as potential regenerative agents in the treatment of knee OA. Several types of adipose-based therapies have good basic science and preclinical data supporting their translation to human therapeutic intervention. Cultured, adipose-derived stem cells appear to be good source of bioactive cells with convenient accessibility, relative abundance, and well-documented regenerative capacity. Non-culture expanded adipose-based therapy, in the forms of stromal vascular fraction and most recently micronized adipose tissue (MAT), have been utilized in patients to treat OA and other cartilage abnormalities with encouraging preliminary data. These adipose-based therapies have shown a lot of therapeutic potential; however, because of the regulatory restrictions on enzymatic isolation and cell expansion, only MAT is currently available in clinical practice in the United States.

Extracted data included cytologic analysis of PRP, study design, and results.Twenty-one studies (12 in vitro, 8 in vivo, one in vitro and in vivo) met the inclusion criteria. The effects of PRP in these studies included increasing chondrocyte and mesenchymal stem cell proliferation, proteoglycan deposition, and type II collagen deposition. PRP was also found to increase the cell viability of chondrocytes and the migration and chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and to inhibit the effect of catabolic cytokines. In vivo, PRP was used as an adjunct to concomitant surgical management, including microfracture surgery and implant, scaffold, and graft insertion. Not all studies concluded that PRP has a positive effect on cartilage repair.The current basic science evidence suggests that PRP has several potential effects on cartilage repair and osteoarthritis, and a proof of concept has been established.

Nine fresh cadavers were dissected. Autografts were implanted under arthroscopy using a retrograde osteochondral transplantation system, and their position was estimated using specific angular calibrators and later confirmed by software analysis of two photographs of the disarticulated ankle joint. In eight cases, the congruence between the surrounding articular cartilage and the cartilage of the graft was high, with differences measuring \textbackslashtextless 1 mm. There were no iatrogenic cartilage lesions of the tibial plafond and no fractures of the talus. All the autografts remained stable during full range of motion cycles of the ankle joint. One failure was reported. This cadaveric study showed that the retrograde osteochondral autograft transplantation technique in the talus is feasible.

Many of these problems occur in younger adult patients and can cause permanent joint pain and stiffness. Several treatment methods have been used to treat the symptomatic lesion, including arthroscopic debridement and microfracture, transfer of autologous osteoarticular tissue from the knee or talus (OATS), autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), frozen and fresh allograft transplantation. Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients underwent fresh talar allograft transplantation with internal fixation for an OLT. Fresh talar allograft transplantation involved arthrotomy of the ankle, often with malleolar osteotomy, and replacement of the talar dome defect with fresh talar allograft tissue and internal fixation. Thirteen of the 18 patients returned for clinical and radiographic examination in addition to completing two validated questionnaires. The other five patients did not return for followup evaluation. The 13 patients who were seen in followup had an average age of 30 (range, 15 to 44) years with a mean followup of 48 months. Results: There was a significant difference ( p &lt; 0.01) between the patients' preoperative and postoperative pain and activity abilities as measured with the Foot Function Index and AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot questionnaires.

In this study, we aim to determine current trends in surgical treatment for OCD lesions in the skeletally immature who have failed 6 months of nonoperative management by surveying a large cohort of orthopaedic surgeons.An electronic survey designed using REDCap to capture surgeon treatment preferences for OCD lesions was distributed to members of the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA). The survey inquired about treating physicians' training and demographics. It then offered a series of clinical vignettes alongside imaging describing patients with varying degrees of severity of OCD following nonoperative treatment. Surgeons were prompted to select from a variety of multiple-choice-based options for further patient management. Standard descriptive statistics were used to summarize and compare the responses.Of the 129 POSNA members completing the pediatric survey, 97.7% were attending level orthopaedic surgeons, the majority identifying with an academic institution and treating mostly skeletally immature patients. In the skeletally immature population, the majority would treat intact, stable OCD lesions with drilling in a retroarticular or transarticular manner. Preferred treatment for unstable, salvageable lesions was screw fixation using bioabsorble materials or metal with variable pitch with no bone graft. The majority of respondents would treat unstable, unsalvageable OCD lesions with chondroplasty and osteochondral transplant/transfer or microfracture/drilling.The POSNA membership appears to agree on principle in terms of treatment modalities for various stages of OCD lesions in the skeletally immature, whereas individual techniques of achieving these principles may vary. Members endorse drilling for stable intact lesions; fixation for unstable, salvageable lesions; and ""defect fill"" for unsalvageable lesions.OCD surgical treatment patterns can be used in future studies to determine which techniques are most effective for given indications, with the goal of designing a research-proven optimal treatment regimen for skeletally immature patients.",0

Osteochondral autograft and allograft reconstruction of these lesions has been used extensively; however, these techniques often require a more invasive surgical exposure, and restoring the natural articular surface radius of curvature can be challenging, particularly in larger lesions. Cell-based repair of these lesions, using autologous chondrocytes in conjunction with bone grafting, has been used with success, although this procedure requires the patient to undergo 2 operations, and access is often restricted due to the high associated costs. Comparable medium-term clinical outcomes have been shown with scaffold-associated mesenchymal stem cell grafting, and this cell-based procedure may also be performed arthroscopically to minimize patient morbidity. In cases of cartilage injury associated with bone loss, this procedure has great potential to repair osteochondral injury when used in conjunction with bone grafting. We present the one-step arthroscopic technique of biologic inlay osteochondral reconstruction in the knee, using an autologous bone graft and a hyaluronic acid-based scaffold embedded with bone marrow aspirate concentrate, to treat full-thickness cartilage lesions associated with significant subchondral bone loss.",0

Injury of cartilage often progresses from the articular surface to the subchondral bone, leading to pathogenesis of tissue degenerative diseases, such as osteoarthritis. Therapies to treat cartilage defects using autologous chondrocyte-based tissue engineering have been developed and used for more than 20 years; however, the challenge of chondrocyte expansion in vitro remains. A promising cell source, cartilage stem/progenitor cells (CSPCs), has attracted recent attention. Because their origin and identity are still unclear, the application potential of CSPCs is under active investigation. Here we have captured the emergence of a group of stem/progenitor cells derived from adult human chondrocytes, highlighted by dynamic changes in expression of the mature chondrocyte marker, COL2, and mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC) marker, CD146. These cells are termed chondrocyte-derived progenitor cells (CDPCs). The stem cell-like potency and differentiation status of CDPCs were determined by physical and biochemical cues during culture. A low-density, low-glucose 2-dimensional culture condition (2DLL) was critical for the emergence and proliferation enhancement of CDPCs. CDPCs showed similar phenotype as bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells but exhibited greater chondrogenic potential. Moreover, the 2DLL-cultured CDPCs proved efficient in cartilage formation both in vitro and in vivo and in repairing large knee cartilage defects (6–13 cm2) in 15 patients. These findings suggest a phenotype conversion between chondrocytes and CDPCs and provide conditions that promote the conversion. These insights expand our understanding of cartilage biology and may enhance the success of chondrocyte-based therapies. Significance Injury of cartilage, a non-self-repairing tissue, often progresses to pathogenesis of degenerative joint diseases, such as osteoarthritis. Although tissue-derived stem cells have been shown to contribute to tissue renewal and homeostasis, the derivation, biological function, and application potential of stem/progenitor cells found in adult human articular cartilage are incompletely understood. This study reports the derivation of a population of cartilage stem/progenitor cells from fully differentiated chondrocytes under specific culture conditions, which have the potential to reassume their chondrocytic phenotype for efficient cartilage regeneration. These findings support the possibility of using in vitro amplified chondrocyte-derived progenitor cells for joint cartilage repair.",0

The scaffolds were seeded with human fibroblasts (outside) and chondrocytes (inside) in a spatial separated mode similar to native tissue, in order to generate meniscus-like tissue in vitro. In chondrogenic culture in the presence of TGF-b3, cell-seeded constructs increased in cellularity and extracellular matrix (ECM) content. Histology and Immunohistochemistry confirmed maintenance of chondrocytic phenotype with higher levels of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) and collagen types I and II. Improved scaffold mechanical properties along with ECM alignment with time in culture suggest this multiporous silk construct as a useful micro-patterned template for directed tissue growth with respect to form and function of meniscus-like tissue.",0

Harnessing this potential for human articular cartilage repair remains challenging. Accessing bone marrow repair cells through marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture is readily achieved with generally good but inconsistent results. Animal and human studies show feasibility for ex vivo processing of bone marrow to isolate, concentrate, and culture mesenchymal stem cells. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to show consistent and clinically meaningful improvement using bone marrow cell preparations above what has been achieved with microfracture. Consequently, microfracture continues to be the simplest and most commonly used method to enhance repair of focal articular cartilage defects. Emerging preclinical work in the equine model suggests a role for enhancing marrow-stimulation techniques through the use of natural scaffolds such as autologous platelet enriched fibrin as well as optimization of joint biology through localized gene therapy to support cartilage repair. In contrast to joint replacement where inert materials of known mechanical properties are used, host biology determines the relative success, failure, and durability of cartilage repair. As such, development of personalized strategies to improve the quality and durability of bone marrow cell–based articular cartilage repair represent exciting new areas of inquiry. Continued advances in stem cell biology, scaffold technologies, and methods to delineate and enhance host biology, both systemically and within the joint, hold promise for harnessing the full power of bone marrow cells to facilitate cartilage repair and regeneration.",0

The mean pre- and postoperative VPS values were calculated to be 75.5 ± 12.32 (range 46-92) and 17.57 ± 10.21 (range 0-40), respectively ( p < 0.01). The mean pre- and postoperative Lysholm knee scores were 44.57 ± 9.35 (range 26-65) and 80 ± 6.9 (range 70-94), respectively ( p < 0.01), and the mean pre- and postoperative Kujala anterior knee pain scores were 48.21 ± 7.78 (range 38-68) and 78.42 ± 7.06 (range 70-96), respectively ( p < 0.01). MRI taken at year 1 postoperatively showed that the autograft bone tissue was sufficiently incorporated into the recipient site in all patients; an even articular surface was formed, but the thickness of the cartilage tissue was mostly uneven between the adjacency of the recipient site and the autograft, which caused no negative effect on clinical and functional outcomes.Despite the difference in thickness of the cartilage tissue between the recipient and the donor site, the AOT technique for the treatment of patellar osteochondral lesions resolves the symptoms of the patient and ensures an apparent functional and clinical improvement even if an articular surface could be created.",0

Various approaches have been proposed to treat these lesions; nevertheless, opinions on indications and clinical efficacy of these techniques are still controversial.To evaluate the outcome of osteochondral autografts for treatment of femoral condyle cartilage lesions at a medium-to long-term follow-up.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.We prospectively evaluated 30 patients (mean age, 29.3 years) with full-thickness knee chondral lesions (<2.5 cm(2)) treated with arthroscopic autologous osteochondral transplantation. Thirteen patients underwent previous surgery, while 17 patients were operated on for the first time. In 19 patients, associated procedures were performed. All patients were evaluated at 2- and 7-year follow-up. The International Cartilage Repair Society form, Tegner score, and magnetic resonance imaging were used for clinical evaluation.The International Cartilage Repair Society objective evaluation showed 76.7% of patients had good or excellent results at 7-year follow-up, and International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score significantly improved from preoperative (34.8) to 7-year follow-up (71.8). The Tegner evaluation showed a significant improvement after the surgery at 2- and 7-year follow-up (from 2.9 to 6.2 and 5.6, respectively); however, we noticed reduced sports activity from 2- to 7-year follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation showed good integration of the graft in the host bone and complete maintenance of the grafted cartilage in more than 60% of cases.The results of this technique at medium- to long-term follow-up are encouraging. This arthroscopic 1-step surgery appears to be a valid solution for treatment of small, grade III to IV cartilage defects.",0

After osteochondral grafts were performed, the animals were treated with PEMFs for 6 h/day or sham-treated. Six animals were sacrificed at 1 month. Fourteen animals were treated for 2 months and sacrificed at 6 months. At 1 month, the osteogenic activity at the transplant-host subchondral bone interface was increased in PEMF-treated animals compared to controls. Articular cartilage was healthy in controls and stimulated animals. At 6 months, complete resorption was observed in four control grafts only. Cyst-like resorption areas were more frequent within the graft of sham-treated animals versus PEMF-treated. The average volume of the cysts was not significantly different between the two groups; nevertheless, analysis of the variance of the volumes demonstrated a significant difference. The histological score showed no significant differences between controls and stimulated animals, but the percentage of surface covered by fibrous tissue was higher in the control group than in the stimulated one. Interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentration in the synovial fluid was significantly lower, and transforming growth factor-beta1 was significantly higher, in PEMF-treated animals compared to controls. One month after osteochondral graft implantation, we observed larger bone formation in PEMF-treated grafts which favors early graft stabilization. In the long term, PEMF exposure limited the bone resorption in subchondral bone; furthermore, the cytokine profile in the synovial fluid was indicative of a more favorable articular environment for the graft.",0

We investigated whether incorporation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into the collagen scaffold improves integration and repair of cartilage defects in a cynomolgus macaque model.Cynomolgus macaque bone marrow-derived MSCs were isolated and incorporated into type-I collagen gel. Full-thickness osteochondral defects (3 mm in diameter, 5 mm in depth) were created in the patellar groove of 36 knees of 18 macaques and were either left untreated (null group, n = 12), had collagen gel alone inserted (gel group, n = 12), or had collagen gel incorporating MSCs inserted (MSC group, n = 12). After 6, 12, and 24 weeks, the cartilage integration and tissue response were evaluated macroscopically and histologically (4 null, 4 gel, and 4 MSC knees at each time point).The gel group showed most cartilage-rich reparative tissue covering the defect, owing to formation of excessive cartilage extruding though the insufficient subchondral bone. Despite the fact that a lower amount of new cartilage was produced, the MSC group had better-quality cartilage with regular surface, seamless integration with neighboring naïve cartilage, and reconstruction of trabecular subchondral bone.Even with intensive investigation, MSC-based cell therapy has not yet been established in experimental cartilage repair. Our model using cynomolgus macaques had optimized conditions, and the method using MSCs is superior to other experimental settings, allowing the possibility that the procedure might be introduced to future clinical practice.",0

Many new procedures and techniques have been developed recently to address osteochondral lesions, indicating that no single procedure is accepted universally. Our treatment algorithm is based on the age of the patient, skeletal maturity, and the presence of adequate subchondral bone attached to the chondral lesion. Most nondisplaced lesions in the patient with open physes will heal with conservative treatment. The onset of skeletal maturity indicates a need for a more aggressive treatment approach. If adequate cortical bone is attached to the fragment, drilling of stable lesions, or drilling with fixation of unstable or loose fragments is appropriate. Autologous bone graft can be necessary to stimulate healing and properly reconstruct the subchondral bony contour. For failed fixation attempts or lesions not amenable to fixation, each treating surgeon must be proficient and comfortable with an articular surface reconstruction technique. The goal for the reconstructive procedure, to produce a smooth gliding articular surface of hyaline or hyaline-like cartilage, is possible using current techniques including mosaicplasty, osteochondral allograft transplantation, and autologous chondrocyte transplantation. Débridement, drilling, microfracture, and abrasion chondroplasty have been shown to result in fibrocartilage with inferior mechanical properties when compared with hyaline cartilage. No long-term studies have been published, however, to confirm the benefits of replacing osteochondral defects with hyaline cartilage rather than fibrocartilage. Although the results of many reconstructive procedures are quite encouraging with early follow up, the ultimate goal is to prevent long-term degenerative arthritis. Only well-designed prospective studies with long-term follow up will determine the adequacy of these procedures in reaching the ultimate goal. This treatment algorithm is based on the senior author's (WGC) experience with the complex dilemma of osteochondral lesions of the knee.",0

This study assessed the effectiveness of autologous bone-marrow stromal cells, which were embedded within a collagen scaffold, to repair a full-thickness articular cartilage defect in the medial femoral condyle of an athlete.A 31-year-old male judo player suffering from pain in the right knee was reviewed. A 20 x 30-mm full-thickness cartilage defect (International Cartilage Repair Society classification (ICRS) grade IV) was revealed in the weight-bearing area of the medial femoral condyle. With the informed consent of the patient, the defect was treated with autologous bone-marrow stromal cells. Bone marrow was aspirated from the iliac crest of the patient 4 weeks before surgery. After removing the erythrocytes, the remaining cells were expanded in culture. Adherent cells were collected and embedded within a collagen gel, which was transferred to the articular cartilage defect in the medial femoral condyle. The implant was covered with an autologous periosteal flap.Seven months after surgery, arthroscopy revealed the defect to be covered with smooth tissues. Histologically, the defect was filled with a hyaline-like type of cartilage tissue which stained positively with Safranin-O. One year after surgery, the clinical symptoms had improved significantly. The patient had reattained his previous activity level and experienced neither pain nor other complications.Our findings indicate that the transplantation of autologous bone-marrow stromal cells can promote the repair of large focal articular cartilage defects in young, active patients.",0

Incidence of cartilage injury rises when considering traumatic origin, especially when approaching significant ligamentous or meniscal pathology. Options for restoration span the gamut from benign neglect to open procedures that restore both cartilage and subchondral bone. The best choice of procedure largely depends on lesion size, depth, and location. Smaller lesions isolated to cartilage <2 cm<sup>2</sup> can be treated with marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture with or without biologic options (bone marrow aspirate concentrate or platelet-rich plasma with or without cartilage precursors or scaffolds). Microfracture alone in larger lesions has been reported to be less durable and it is therefore not recommended for larger lesions. Smaller lesions <2 cm<sup>2</sup> that include a subchondral injury can be treated with osteochondral autograft implantation, in which a core of cartilage and bone is transferred from a relative non-weightbearing surface to the lesion. Larger osteochondral lesions >2 cm<sup>2</sup> are better treated with osteochondral allograft transplantation, where osteochondral cores from a size-matched, fresh cadaver are matched to the patient's lesion. This option may require multiple cores to be placed in a ""snowman"" pattern; however, recent literature demonstrated that a single plug might produce better outcomes. Alternatively, for large chondral-only lesions, a resurfacing procedure may be chosen that may include biologic options. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), currently in its third iteration (matrix ACI [MACI]), is an excellent choice with good long-term durability. In addition, MACI may be used for chondral lesions in the patellofemoral joint where matching the native joint topology may be more difficult. If the patient has an underlying bone marrow lesion but an intact cartilage cap that appears healthy on arthroscopic examination, one may consider a core decompression and injection with biologics such as BMAC and bony scaffold with fibrin glue (also known as <i>bioplasty</i>). It is also critical that the surgeon address any concomitant knee pathology that would compromise cartilage restoration. This includes addressing malalignment with distal femoral, proximal tibial, or tibial tubercle osteotomy, significant meniscal deficiency with meniscal transplant, and any instability from lack of cruciate or collateral ligaments with ligament reconstruction.",0

An osteochondral defect (diameter, 4.8 mm; depth, 3 mm) was created in the trochlear groove of the knee using a drill. The defects were left empty in the control group and were filled with cylindrical plugs of allogeneic ADSCs extracted from adipose tissue in the experimental group. Macroscopic scoring, histologic scoring, and immunohistologic stainability of type II collagen were evaluated at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively.The macroscopic scores of the healing tissue in the experimental group were significantly greater than those in the control group at 12 weeks (P = .031). Histologically, safranin O staining was noted at 4 weeks and increased gradually over time in the experimental group. The modified International Cartilage Repair Society histologic score in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the controls at 8 and 12 weeks (14 vs 9 at 8 weeks [P = .008], 18 vs 10 at 12 weeks [P = .007]). The implanted tissue was positive for type II collagen, and stainability increased gradually over time.The 3-dimensional scaffold-free allogeneic ADSCs implanted into the osteochondral defect survived, adhered to the defect, increased the stainability of type II collagen gradually over time, and promoted histologic healing in a rabbit model.ADSC implantation designed to promote osteochondral healing may play an important role in osteochondral healing.",0

Herein, we evaluate the delivery of xenogeneic human MSCs (hMSCs) within an injectable ELR-based hydrogel carrier for osteochondral regeneration in rabbits. First, a critical-size osteochondral defect was created in the femora of the animals and subsequently filled with the ELR-based hydrogel alone or with embedded hMSCs. Regeneration outcomes were evaluated after three months by gross assessment, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, showing complete filling of the defect and the de novo formation of hyaline-like cartilage and subchondral bone in the hMSC-treated knees. Furthermore, histological sectioning and staining of every sample confirmed regeneration of the full cartilage thickness and early subchondral bone repair, which was more similar to the native cartilage in the case of the cell-loaded ELR-based hydrogel. Overall histological differences between the two groups were assessed semi-quantitatively using the Wakitani scale and found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). Immunofluorescence against a human mitochondrial antibody three months post-implantation showed that the hMSCs were integrated into the de novo formed tissue, thus suggesting their ability to overcome the interspecies barrier. Hence, we conclude that the use of xenogeneic MSCs embedded in an ELR-based hydrogel leads to the successful regeneration of hyaline cartilage in osteochondral lesions.",0

The aim of our study was to evaluate the chromosomal stability of human chondrocytes subjected to typical cell culture procedures needed for regenerative approaches in polymer-scaffold-assisted cartilage repair. Chondrocytes derived from post mortem donors and from donors scheduled for ACI were expanded, cryopreserved and re-arranged in polyglycolic acid (PGA)–fibrin scaffolds for tissue culture. Chondrocyte redifferentiation was analyzed by electron microscopy, histology and gene expression analysis. Karyotyping was performed using GTG banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization on a single cell basis. Chondrocytes showed de- and redifferentiation accompanied by the formation of extracellular matrix and induction of typical chondrocyte marker genes like type II collagen in PGA–fibrin scaffolds. Post mortem chondrocytes showed up to 1.7% structural and high numbers of numerical (up to 26.7%) chromosomal aberrations, while chondrocytes from living donors scheduled for ACI showed up to 1.8% structural and up to 1.3% numerical alterations. Cytogenetically, cell culture procedures and PGA–fibrin scaffolds did not significantly alter chromosomal integrity of the chondrocyte genome. Human chondrocytes derived from living donors subjected to regenerative medicine cell culture procedures like cell expansion, cryopreservation and culture in resorbable polymer-based scaffolds show normal chromosomal integrity and normal karyotypes.",0

Matrix-associated stem cell implants (MASI) represent a promising approach for repair of cartilage defects. However, limited survival of MASI creates a significant bottleneck for successful cartilage regeneration outcomes and functional reconstitution. We report an approach for noninvasive detection of stem cell apoptosis with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), based on a caspase-3-sensitive nanoaggregation MRI probe (C-SNAM). C-SNAM self-assembles into nanoparticles after hydrolysis by caspase-3, leading to 90% amplification of (1)H MR signal and prolonged in vivo retention. Following intra-articular injection, C-SNAM causes significant MR signal enhancement in apoptotic MASI compared to viable MASI. Our results indicate that C-SNAM functions as an imaging probe for stem cell apoptosis in MASI. This concept could be applied to a broad range of cell transplants and target sites.",0

MRI showed that cartilage repair filled more than 50 % of the initial defect in 9 patients. Standard radiographs revealed slight narrowing of the joint line. Overall, functional scores improved durably by 50 %, although activity level decreased substantially.

To critically understand the successful restoration of the defect, biomechanical and histological analysis of the implanted bone blocks is required. The aim of the study was to analyse the ability of the bone block technique to restore huge bone defects by mimicking the physiological subchondral zone.MethodsThe experiments were performed using lateral femoral condyles and iliac crest bone grafts from the same cadavers (n=6) preserved using the Thiel method. CT scans were made to evaluate bone pathology. Bone mineral density of all specimens was evaluated in the femoral head prior to testing. A series of tests were conducted for each pair of specimens. A static compression test was performed using an electro dynamic testing machine with maximal strength and failure behavior analyzed. Biomechanical tests were performed in the medial-lateral direction for iliac crest and for femoral condyles with and without removal of the cartilage layer. Histological analysis was performed on decalcified specimens for comparison of the condyle at lesion site and the graft.ResultsNo significant difference in failure load could be found for iliac crest (53.3-180.5N) and femoral condyle samples upon cartilage removal (38.5-175.1N) (n.s.). The femoral condyles with an intact cartilage layer showed significantly higher loads (118.3-260.4N) compared to the other groups indicating that native or regenerated cartilage can further increase the failure load (p\textbackslashtextless0.05). Bone mineral density significantly influenced failure load in all study groups (p\textbackslashtextless0.05). Histological similarity of the cancellous bone in the femoral condyle and in the iliac crest was observed. However, within the subchondral zone, there was a higher density of sponge like organized trabeculae in the bone samples from the iliac crest. Tide mark was only detected at the osteochondral interface in femoral condyles.ConclusionThis study demonstrated that, bone blocks derived from the iliac crest allow a biomechanical appropriate and stable restoration of huge bony defects by resembling the subchondral zone of the femoral condyle. Therefore, bone augmentation from the iliac crest combined with matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte transplantation seems to be a reasonable method to treat these challenging injuries.",0

We hypothesized that pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) would improve growth and healing of tissue-engineered cartilage grafts in a direction-dependent manner. PEMF stimulation of engineered cartilage constructs was first evaluated in vitro using passaged adult canine chondrocytes embedded in an agarose hydrogel scaffold. PEMF coils oriented parallel to the articular surface induced superior repair stiffness compared to both perpendicular PEMF (p = .026) and control (p = .012). This was correlated with increased glycosaminoglycan deposition in both parallel and perpendicular PEMF orientations compared to control (p = .010 and .028, respectively). Following in vitro optimization, the potential clinical translation of PEMF was evaluated in a preliminary in vivo preclinical adult canine model. Engineered osteochondral constructs (∅ 6 mm × 6 mm thick, devitalized bone base) were cultured to maturity and implanted into focal defects created in the stifle (knee) joint. To assess expedited early repair, animals were assessed after a 3-month recovery period, with microfracture repairs serving as an additional clinical control. In vivo, PEMF led to a greater likelihood of normal chondrocyte (odds ratio [OR]: 2.5, p = .051) and proteoglycan (OR: 5.0, p = .013) histological scores in engineered constructs. Interestingly, engineered constructs outperformed microfracture in clinical scoring, regardless of PEMF treatment (p < .05). Overall, the studies provided evidence that PEMF stimulation enhanced engineered cartilage growth and repair, demonstrating a potential low-cost, low-risk, noninvasive treatment modality for expediting early cartilage repair.",0

From the regulatory point of view, the ovine model is one of the suggested large animal models for pre-clinical studies. The aim of our study was to evaluate the in vitro re-differentiation capacity of expanded ovine chondrocytes in biomechanically characterized polyglycolic acid (PGA)/fibrin biomaterials for scaffold-assisted cartilage repair. Methods Ovine chondrocytes harvested from adult articular cartilage were expanded in monolayer and re-assembled three-dimensionally in PGA-fibrin scaffolds. De- and re-differentiation of ovine chondrocytes in PGA-fibrin scaffolds was assessed by histological and immuno-histochemical staining as well as by real-time gene expression analysis of typical cartilage marker molecules and the matrix-remodelling enzymes matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) -1, -2 and −13 as well as their inhibitors. PGA scaffolds characteristics including degradation and stiffness were analysed by electron microscopy and biomechanical testing. Results Histological, immuno-histochemical and gene expression analysis showed that dedifferentiated chondrocytes re-differentiate in PGA-fibrin scaffolds and form a cartilaginous matrix. Re-differentiation was accompanied by the induction of type II collagen and aggrecan, while MMP expression decreased in prolonged tissue culture. Electron microscopy and biomechanical tests revealed that the non-woven PGA scaffold shows a textile structure with high tensile strength of 3.6 N/mm 2 and a stiffness of up to 0.44 N/mm 2 , when combined with gel-like fibrin. Conclusion These data suggest that PGA-fibrin is suited as a mechanically stable support structure for scaffold-assisted chondrocyte grafts, initiating chondrogenic re-differentiation of expanded chondrocytes.",0

Current methods such as microfracture, osteoarticular autograft transfer system, mosaicplasty, and autologous chondrocyte implantation are somewhat successful in regenerating cartilage; however, they also have significant limitations. The future of fourth generation cartilage repair focuses on gene therapy, the use of stem cells (bone marrow, adipose, or muscle derived), and tissue engineering. Emerging techniques include creating elastin-like polymers derived from native elastin sequences to serve as biocompatible scaffolds; using hydrogels to obtain a homogeneous distribution of cells within a 3-dimensional matrix; and using nonviral gene delivery via nucleofection to allow mesenchymal stem cells the ability to express osteogenic growth factors. Although many of the techniques mentioned have yet to be used in a cartilage regeneration model, we have tried to anticipate how methods used in other specialties may facilitate improved cartilage repair.",0

In five sheep, a similar defect was filled with an osteochondral autograft, and the donor site was filled with a biphasic construct combining CaP granules and a chitosan/cellulosic polymer. Sheep were monitored daily for lameness. Stifle radiographs and MRI were evaluated at 20 weeks, prior to animals being humanely killed. Surgical sites were evaluated with histology, microcomputed tomography, and scanning electron microscopy.Clinical outcomes were satisfactory regardless of the tested biomaterials. All implants appeared in place on imaging studies. Osteointegration of prosthetic implants varied between sites, with limited ingrowth of new bone into the titanium structure. Autografts and biphasic constructs were consistently well integrated in subchondral bone. All autografts except one contained a cartilage surface, and all biphasic constructs except one partially restored hyaline cartilage surface.Biphasic constructs supported hyaline cartilage and subchondral bone regeneration, although restoration of the articular cartilage was incomplete.Biphasic constructs may provide an alternative treatment for osteochondral defects, offering a less invasive approach compared with autologous grafts and eliminating the requirement for a prosthetic implant.",0

Cartilage has a tissue-specific architecture, complicating recreation by synthetic biomaterials. A novel approach for reconstruction is the use of devitalised cartilage. Treatment with high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) achieves devitalisation while biomechanical properties are remained. Therefore, in the present study, cartilage was devitalised using HHP treatment and the potential for revitalisation with chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was investigated. The devitalisation of cartilage was performed by application of 480 MPa over 10 minutes. Effective cellular inactivation was demonstrated by the trypan blue exclusion test and DNA quantification. Histology and electron microscopy examinations showed undamaged cartilage structure after HHP treatment. For revitalisation chondrocytes and MSCs were cultured on devitalised cartilage without supplementation of chondrogenic growth factors. Both chondrocytes and MSCs significantly increased expression of cartilage-specific genes. ECM stainings showed neocartilage-like structure with positive AZAN staining as well as collagen type II and aggrecan deposition after three weeks of cultivation. Our results showed that HHP treatment caused devitalisation of cartilage tissue. ECM proteins were not influenced, thus, providing a scaffold for chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and chondrocytes.

We tested the hypothesis that in skeletally aged rabbit knees, microdrill holes can be stimulated to remodel the bone plate and induce a more integrated, voluminous and hyaline cartilage repair tissue when treated by subchondral chitosan/blood implants.New Zealand White rabbits (13 or 32 months old, N = 7) received two 1.5 mm diameter, 2 mm depth drill holes in each knee, either left to bleed as surgical controls or press-fit with a 10 kDa (distal hole: 10K) or 40 kDa (proximal hole: 40K) chitosan/blood implant with fluorescent chitosan tracer. Post-operative knee effusion was documented. Repair tissues at day 0 (N = 1) and day 70 post-surgery (N = 6) were analyzed by micro-computed tomography, and by histological scoring and histomorphometry (SafO, Col-2, and Col-1) at day 70.All chitosan implants were completely cleared after 70 days, without increasing transient post-operative knee effusion compared to controls. Proximal control holes had worse osteochondral repair than distal holes. Both implant formulations induced bone remodeling and improved lateral integration of the bone plate at the hole edge. The 40K implant inhibited further bone repair inside 50% of the proximal holes, while the 10K implant specifically induced a ""wound bloom"" reaction, characterized by decreased bone plate density in a limited zone beyond the initial hole edge, and increased woven bone (WB) plate repair inside the initial hole (P = 0.016), which was accompanied by a more voluminous and hyaline cartilage repair (P < 0.05 vs control defects).In a challenging aged rabbit model, bone marrow-derived hyaline cartilage repair can be promoted by treating acute drill holes with a biodegradable subchondral implant that elicits bone plate resorption followed by anabolic WB repair within a 70-day repair period.",0

A variety of surgical techniques have been developed. However, the optimal surgical technique is still controversial. We present a novel technique in which autologous bone grafting is combined with gel-type autologous chondrocyte implantation (GACI).Isolated severe osteochondral defects of the medial or lateral femoral condyle were treated by a two-step procedure. Firstly, chondrocytes were harvested during arthroscopy and cultured for 6 weeks. Secondly, a full thickness corticospongious autologuos bone graft, harvested from the medial or lateral femur condyle, is impacted in the defect and covered by GACI. The fibrin gel fills up to the exact shape of the chondral lesion and polymerizes within 3 min after application.From 2009 to 2011, 9 patients, median age 35 years (range 23–47), were treated by the combined autologous bone grafting and GACI technique. Median defect size was 7.1 cm2 (range 2.5–12.0), and median depth of the lesion was 0.9 cm (range 0.8–1.2). Median follow-up was 9 months (range 6–12 months). Six patients were available for 12-month follow-up. The mean IKDC score showed a 6-month improvement from 35 (SD ± 16) to 51 (SD ± 18) (n = 9; p = 0.01), and a 1-year improvement from 35 (SD ± 16) to 57 (SD ± 20) (n = 6; p = 0.03). The mean KOOS improved from 44 (SD ± 16) to 62 (SD ± 19) (n = 9; p = 0.07) at 6-month follow-up and from 44 (SD ± 16) to 65 (SD ± 24) (n = 6; p = 0.1) at 12-month follow-up. There was one failure that needed conversion to a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.Combined autologous bone grafting and GACI may offer an alternative surgical option for severe and unstable osteochondral defects of the knee.",0

The MACI implant is fixed with fibrin glue, and little or no suturing is necessary. The procedure can be performed arthroscopically or by miniarthrotomy.

In this Technical Note, we describe a modification of the NAMIC procedure using mosaicplasty trephines to prepare the lesion surface and to shape collagen implants in an all-arthroscopic approach (A-NAMIC). This technique is indicated for the treatment of International Cartilage Repair Society grade III to IV knee chondral lesions of ≤4 cm2. After damaged cartilage is debrided, trephines are used to create a flat, circular lesion surfaces. Subsequently, BMS is performed with nanofracture, eliciting reproducible and stop-controlled subchondral bone perforations of 9-mm depth and 1-mm width. The collagen membrane is then cut to size with the trephine, placed over the prepared defect, and secured with fibrin glue, preventing loss of regenerating cells and growth factors to the joint space. Using trephines allows the rapid and precise creation of smooth defect surfaces with known dimensions, ensuring optimal lesion coverage. Additionally, nanofracture reduces trabecular compaction and allows for a deeper access to subchondral bone in comparison with conventional microfracture, improving lesion filling and production of cartilage with higher hyaline content.",0

Retro-articular and trans-articular drilling of OCD lesions has up to a 33 % failure rate based on complete radiographic healing. Healing may be improved with the delivery of pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells into the lesion. We describe a technically simple procedure for retro-articular drilling with the addition of percutaneous iliac crest bone graft placement for stable juvenile OCD lesions of the knee. By using a bone marrow biopsy needle, the bone grafting can be performed in a reproducible manner and in shorter time than in previously described techniques.

As demonstrated in the past, adult stem cells retain promising clonogenicity. Therefore, we conducted this study to elucidate the effects of cultured autologous chondrogenic satellite cells (CACSCs) compared with subchondral drilling (SCD) for the repair of full-thickness articular cartilage defects.We examined CACSCs isolated from the knee of rabbits using flow cytometry for the expression of stemness and chondrocyte-specific factors. Subsequently, we created a full-thickness cartilage defect model with a diameter of 3 mm and depth of 2 mm on the articular surface of trochlear grooves in the left knee of 24 New Zealand white rabbits. Then we drilled subchondrally through the defect in all animals and stuffed the defects with 10-μg/cm(2) collagen scaffolds. In the treatment group, we instilled CACSCs at 5 × 10(6) cells/mL in the collagen scaffold and collected samples on days 15, 30, and 45.The CACSCs revealed significant expression of CD106, CD44, collagen type 2, and aggrecan. In conjunction with SCD, CACSCs improved healing of the articular cartilage defect, as evidenced by the formation of hyaline-like tissue grossly and histologically. The healed tissue also revealed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the expression of collagen type 2 and aggrecan (by real-time polymerase chain reaction) during the experiment.In conjunction with SCD, CACSCs may be considered to improve articular cartilage damage.",0

Methods The study used magnetic resonance imaging data as the basis for construction of the titanium implant using a three-dimensional printing technique. This was then placed on the medial condyle of the knee joint in eight sheep and left in place in vivo over a period of six months. Following euthanasia, the local biological response was analyzed using micro-computed tomography, light microscopy and histological evaluation (International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score). The variables were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model. Odds ratios were given with 95% confidence intervals. Results The osseointegration rate was 62.1% (SD 3.9%). All implants were prone to the neighboring cartilage bed (4.4–1096.1 μm). Using the IRCS score, the elements ‘surface’, ‘matrix’, ‘cell distribution’ and ‘cell population’ all showed pathological changes on the operated side, although these did not correlate with implant elevation. On average, a difference of 0.7 mm (± 2 mm) was found between the digitally planned implant and the real implant. Conclusions As a result of imprecise segmentation and difficult preparation conditions at the prosthesis bed, as well as changes at the surface of the implant over the operational lifetime of the prosthesis, it must be stated that the approach implemented here of using a customized implant for the treatment of focal full-thickness cartilage defects at the knee did not meet our expectations.",0

Numerous studies have also shown enhanced repair when BMDMSCs, scaffolds, and growth factors are placed into chondral defects. Platelets provide a rich milieu of growth factors and, along with fibrin, are readily available for clinical use. The objective of this study was to determine if the addition of BMDMSCs to an autologous platelet-enriched fibrin (APEF) scaffold enhances chondral repair compared with APEF alone.A 15-mm-diameter full-thickness chondral defect was created on the lateral trochlear ridge of both stifle joints of twelve adult horses. In each animal, one defect was randomly assigned to receive APEF+BMDMSCs and the contralateral defect received APEF alone. Repair tissues were evaluated one year later with arthroscopy, histological examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), and biomechanical testing.The arthroscopic findings, MRI T2 map, histological scores, structural stiffness, and material stiffness were similar (p > 0.05) between the APEF and APEF+BMDMSC-treated repairs at one year. Ectopic bone was observed within the repair tissue in four of twelve APEF+BMDMSC-treated defects. Defects repaired with APEF alone had less trabecular bone edema (as seen on MRI) compared with defects repaired with APEF+BMDMSCs. Micro-CT analysis showed thinner repair tissue in defects repaired with APEF+BMDMSCs than in those treated with APEF alone (p < 0.05).APEF alone resulted in thicker repair tissue than was seen with APEF+BMDMSCs. The addition of BMDMSCs to APEF did not enhance cartilage repair and stimulated bone formation in some cartilage defects.APEF supported repair of critical-size full-thickness chondral defects in horses, which was not improved by the addition of BMDMSCs. This work supports further investigation to determine whether APEF enhances cartilage repair in humans.",0

In the present study, we established a hybrid scaffold to codeliver SMSCs and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), which can integrate the scaffolds, the growth factor, and the autogenous cells within rabbit cartilage defects. A chitosan hydrogel and a decellularized bone matrix were used to fabricate the gel-solid duplex phase biomaterials, which were proven to retain more cells, promote tissue integration, and provide mechanical support. In vitro experiments demonstrated that this hybrid scaffold could release TGF-β in a controlled biphasic pattern, which can promote cell proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation of loaded rabbit SMSCs. For in vivo experiments, we filled cartilage defects with the hybrid materials, delivering autogenous SMSCs and TGF-β simultaneously via chitosan's sol-gel transition. Histological analysis, magnetic resonance imaging, and nanoindentation assessment indicated superior cartilage regeneration using this codelivery system compared with that from routine microfracture or control delivery scaffolds. Beyond cartilage regeneration, the easy preparation, favorable biophysical properties, and controlled release ability make this codelivery system applicable to transport other tissue-specific cells or biofactors for tissue engineering.",0

Cell therapy, such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), is a widespread option to treat larger cartilage defects still lacking standardization of in vitro cell culture parameters. We hypothesize that mRNA expression of cytokines and proteases before and after ACI is influenced by in vitro parameters: cell-passage, cell-density and membrane-holding time. Knee joint articular chondrocytes, harvested from rabbits (n = 60), were cultured/processed under varying conditions: after three different cell-passages (P1, P3, and P5), cells were seeded on 3D collagen matrices (approximately 25 mm3) at three different densities (2 × 105/matrix, 1 × 106/matrix, and 3 × 106/matrix) combined with two different membrane-holding times (5 h and two weeks) prior autologous transplantation. Those combinations resulted in 18 different in vivo experimental groups. Two defects/knee/animal were created in the trochlear groove (defect dimension: ∅ 4 mm × 2 mm). Four identical cell-seeded matrices (CSM) were assembled and grouped in two pairs: One pair giving pre-operative in vitro data (CSM-i), the other pair was implanted in vivo and harvested 12 weeks post-implantation (CSM-e). CSMs were analyzed for TNF-α, IL-1β, MMP-1, and MMP-3 via qPCR. CSM-i showed higher expression of IL-1β, MMP-1, and MMP-3 compared to CSM-e. TNF-α expression was higher in CSM-e. Linearity between CSM-i and CSM-e values was found, except for TNF-α. IL-1β expression was higher in CSM-i at higher passage and longer membrane-holding time. IL-1β expression decreased with prolonged membrane-holding time in CSM-e. For TNF-α, the reverse was true. Lower cell-passages and lower membrane-holding time resulted in stronger TNF-α expression. Prolonged membrane-holding time resulted in increased MMP levels among CSM-i and CSM-e. Cellular density was of no significant effect. We demonstrated cytokine and MMP expression levels to be directly influenced by in vitro culture settings in ACI. Linearity of expression-patterns between CSM-i and CSM-e may predict ACI regeneration outcome in vivo. Cytokine/protease interaction within the regenerate tissue could be guided via adjusting in vitro culture parameters, of which membrane-holding time resulted the most relevant one.",0

To overcome mentioned dilemmas, a simulation of the articular cartilage microenvironment was constructed by primary articular cartilage cells (pACs) and acellular cartilage extracellular matrix- (ACECM-) oriented scaffold cocultured with human umbilical cord Wharton’s jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hWJMSCs) in vitro. The coculture groups showed more affluent cartilage special matrix ingredients including collagen II and aggrecan based on the results of histological staining and western blotting and cut down as many pACs as possible. The RT-PCR and cell viability experiments also demonstrated that hWJMSCs were successfully induced to differentiate into chondrocytes when cultured in the simulated cartilage microenvironment, as confirmed by the significant upregulation of collagen II and aggrecan, while the cell proliferation activity of pACs was significantly improved by cell-cell interactions. Therefore, compared with monoculture and chondrogenic induction of inducers, coculture providing a simulated native articular microenvironment was a potential and temperate way to regulate the biological behaviors of pACs and hWJMSCs to regenerate the hyaline articular cartilage.",0

Importantly, untreated lesions lead to a high rate of osteoarthritis. The current strategies to repair these defects include osteochondral autograft transplantation or “sandwich” strategies combining bone autografts with autologous chondrocyte implantation, with poorly documented long-term outcomes. In this study, we first investigated the capacity of juvenile osteochondral grafts (OCGs) to repair osteochondral defects in skeletally mature rats. With this regenerative model in view, we produced a new biological, bilayered and scaffold-free Tissue Engineered construct (bTEC) for the repair of a deep osteochondral defect of the rat knee. Methods Cylindrical OCGs were excised from the femoral intercondylar groove of the knee of skeletally immature rats (5 weeks) and transplanted into osteochondral defects created in skeletally mature rats (11 weeks). To create bTECs, micromasses (μMasses) of human periosteum-derived progenitor cells (hPDCs) and human articular chondrocytes (hACs) were produced in vitro using previously optimized chemically defined medium formulations containing growth and differentiation factors including bone morphogenetic proteins. These two μMass types were subsequently implanted as bilayered constructs into osteochondral defects in nude rats. At 4 and 16 weeks after surgery, the knees were collected and processed for subsequent 3D imaging analysis and histological evaluation. Micro-computed tomography (μCT), H&E, and Safranin O staining were used to evaluate the degree and quality of tissue repair. Results The osteochondral unit of the knee joint in 5 weeks old rats exhibits an immature phenotype, displaying active subchondral bone formation through endochondral ossification and the absence of a tidemark. When transplanted into skeletally mature animals, the immature OCGs resumed their maturation process, i.e., formed new subchondral bone, established the tidemark, and maintained their Safranin O-positive hyaline cartilage at 16 weeks after transplantation. The bTECs (hPDCs + hACs) could partially recapitulate the biology as seen with the immature OCGs, including the formation of the joint surface architecture with typical zonation, ranging from non-mineralized hyaline cartilage in the superficial layers to a progressively mineralized matrix at the interface with a new subchondral bone plate. Conclusions Cell-based TE constructs mimicking immature OCGs and displaying a hierarchically organized structure comprising of different tissue forming units seem an attractive strategy to treat deep osteochondral defects of the knee.",0

Third-generation techniques (ACI3) are now available that deliver autologous cultured chondrocytes into the defect using cell scaffolds. The successful outcomes of these techniques have some dependency on presurgical and postsurgical patient rehabilitation. Objectives: To determine if the standard of reporting for rehabilitation has improved in ACI3 studies; previous reviews in this field recommended describing the detail of this rehabilitation and patient compliance as integral elements. Evidence Acquisition: A computerized search was performed in March 2013. Criteria for inclusion were any studies that evaluated or described the process of ACI3 in the knee and subsequent rehabilitation. The modified Coleman Methodology Score (CMS) was used to rate the standard of reporting of rehabilitation and surgical procedures; review articles were also evaluated for quality using the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT). Mean scores, odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and Mann-Whitney U statistics were calculated. Evidence Synthesis: An improvement in mean CMS was seen compared with previous reviews, but rehabilitation reporting scores were lower than their surgical equivalent; significant association was seen between studies with rehabilitator involvement and high scores in the individual CMS rehabilitation element. Predominant SORT scores of 2A indicated medium strength of recommendation. Conclusions: The CMS provides a general overview of methodological quality, but a more specialized tool to report on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the rehabilitation process would help raise the standards. It is recommended that rehabilitation therapists be included as key members of research teams and be involved in the design, implementation, and reporting of future studies.",0

Hounsfield unit (HU) readings were obtained at the synthetic implant, transplanted autograft plug, soft-tissue, cancellous bone, and cortical bone sites. The implant site material was graded by an established ossification quality score (range, 1 to 4).Nine patients underwent CT scans at intervals ranging from 2 to 63 months after surgery. This sequence of images tracked the potential development of bone ingrowth activity. Postoperative imaging confirmed complete autograft bone plug healing. The synthetic implant site CT scans showed a drop in density from 84 HU at 4 months to 19 HU by 13 months (fibrous scar density). The ossification quality score for all synthetic implants was 1 (tract filled with soft-tissue density) instead of 4 (cancellous bone). The transplanted autograft plug densities were consistent with and completely incorporated into the adjacent cancellous bone.The synthetic multiphase implant showed no evidence of bone ingrowth, osteoconductivity, or ossification. The implant density declined over time to that of fibrous scar. This synthetic plug does not provide subchondral structural support for any tissue that grows over it. This study does not support the use of this implant for the primary repair of articular cartilage lesions.Level IV, therapeutic case series.",0

We synthesized a PVA-poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) hydrogel formulation and determined its ability to function as a treatment option for condylar osteochondral (OC) defects in a New Zealand white rabbit (NZWR) model for 12 weeks and 24 weeks. In addition to hydrogel OC implants, tensile bar-shaped hydrogels were also implanted subcutaneously to evaluate changes in mechanical properties as a function of in vivo duration. There were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in the water content measured in the OC hydrogel implant that was harvested after 12 weeks and 24 weeks, and non-implanted controls. There were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in the break stress, strain at break or modulus of the tensile bars either between groups. Histological analysis of the OC defect, synovial capsule and fibrous tissue around the tensile bars determined hydrogel biocompatibility. Twelve-week hydrogels were found to be in situ flush with the articular cartilage; meniscal tissue demonstrated an intact surface. Twenty-four week hydrogels protruded from the defect site due to lack of integration with subchondral tissue, causing fibrillation to the meniscal surface. Condylar micro-CT scans ruled out osteolysis and bone cysts of the subchondral bone, and no PVA-PAAc hydrogel contents were found in the synovial fluid. The PVA-PAAc hydrogel was determined to be fully biocompatible, maintained its properties over time, and performed well at the 12 week time point. Physical fixation of the PVA-PAAc hydrogel to the subchondral bone is required to ensure long-term performance of hydrogel plugs for OC defect repair.",0

The MRI examinations were performed 12 and 24 months after surgery. A paired t-test was applied to compare pre- and post-operative clinical findings (VAS and AOFAS) and Magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score changes in the follow-up. To assess the correlation between variation of AOFAS and MOCART scores, the Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated.No complications after surgery were encountered. From pre-operative to post-operative values, there was a significant (P < 0.001) reduction of mean VAS pain score (6.3 ± 0.9,range: 4-8 and 2.9 ± 1.8,range: 0-6, respectively) and increase of AOFAS score (60.2 ± 7.8,range: 50-74 and 77.4 ± 16.2,range: 50-100, respectively). Among 16 patients, six (37%) were not satisfied at the end of follow-up, six (37%) were moderately satisfied and four (25%) were highly satisfied. The treatment was considered failed in five out of 16 patients (31%). Among them, four (25%) required re-interventions with implantation of ankle prostheses, whereas one patient was treated with a further AMIC technique combined with autologous bone graft and platelet-rich plasma.

However, no correlation was seen between AOFAS and MOCART changes (r = 0.215, p = 0.609).The high rates of treatment failure encountered in our study using MaioRegen need to be confirmed by larger studies and should induce the scientific community questioning the reliability of this biomimetic scaffold for the treatment of OLTs.",0

Hence, in the present study, we evaluated the potential of this expedited tissue engineering approach for regenerating osteochondral defects in rabbits.Autologous muscle tissue grafts from female White New Zealand rabbits were directly transduced with an adenoviral BMP-2 vector or remained unmodified. Osteochondral defects in the medial condyle of rabbit knees were treated with either BMP-2 activated muscle tissue implants or unmodified muscle tissue or remained empty. After 13 weeks, repair of osteochondral defects was examined by biomechanical indentation testing and by histology/imunohistochemistry applying an extended O'Driscoll scoring system and histomorphometry.Biomechanical investigations revealed a trend towards slightly improved mechanical properties of the group receiving BMP-2 activated muscle tissue compared to unmodified muscle treatment and empty defect controls. However, a statistically significant difference was noted only between BMP-2 muscle and unmodified muscle treatment. Also, histological evaluation resulted in slightly higher histological scores and improved collagen I/II ratio without statistical significance in the BMP-2 treatment group. Histomorphometry indicated enhanced repair of subchondral bone after treatment with BMP-2 muscle, with a significantly larger bone area compared to untreated defects.Gene activated muscle tissue grafts showed potential for osteochondral defect repair. There is room for improvement via the use of appropriate growth factor combinations.",0

EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Knowledge databases were screened for the use of cBMA in the repair of cartilage, bone, and tendon repair. We extracted data on tissue type, cBMA preparation, cBMA concentration, study methods, outcomes, and level of evidence and reported the results in tables and text.A total of 36 studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in this review. Thirty-one of 36 (86%) studies reported the method of centrifugation and preparation of cBMA with 15 (42%) studies reporting either a cell concentration or an increase from baseline. Variation of cBMA application was seen amongst the studies evaluated. Twenty-one of 36 (58%) were level of evidence IV, 12/36 (33%) were level of evidence III, and 3/36 (8%) were level of evidence II. Studies evaluated full thickness chondral lesions (7 studies), osteochondral lesions (10 studies), osteoarthritis (5 studies), nonunion or fracture (9 studies), or tendon injuries (5 studies). Significant clinical improvement with the presence of hyaline-like values and lower incidence of fibrocartilage on T2 mapping was found in patients receiving cBMA in the treatment of cartilaginous lesions. Bone consolidation and time to bone union was improved in patients receiving cBMA. Enhanced healing rates, improved quality of the repair surface on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, and a decreased risk of re-rupture was demonstrated in patients receiving cBMA as an adjunctive treatment in tendon repair.The current literature demonstrates the potential benefits of utilizing cBMA for the repair of cartilaginous lesions, bony defects, and tendon injuries in the clinical setting. This study also demonstrates discrepancies between the literature with regards to various methods of centrifugation, variable cell count concentrations, and lack of standardized outcome measures. Future studies should attempt to examine the integral factors necessary for tissue regeneration and renewal including stem cells, growth factors and a biologic scaffold.",0

During the procedure the subchondral bone is penetrated, allowing bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to migrate towards the defect site and form new cartilage tissue. Microfracture surgery generally results in the formation of mechanically inferior fibrocartilage. As a result, this technique offers only temporary clinical improvement. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine may improve the outcome of microfracture surgery. Filling the subchondral defect with a biomaterial may provide a template for the formation of new hyaline cartilage tissue. In this study, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess the current evidence for the efficacy of cartilage regeneration in preclinical models using acellular biomaterials implanted after marrow stimulating techniques (microfracturing and subchondral drilling) compared to the natural healing response of defects. The review aims to provide new insights into the most effective biomaterials, to provide an overview of currently existing knowledge, and to identify potential lacunae in current studies to direct future research. A comprehensive search was systematically performed in PubMed and EMBASE (via OvidSP) using search terms related to tissue engineering, cartilage and animals. Primary studies in which acellular biomaterials were implanted in osteochondral defects in the knee or ankle joint in healthy animals were included and study characteristics tabulated (283 studies out of 6,688 studies found). For studies comparing non-treated empty defects to defects containing implanted biomaterials and using semi-quantitative histology as outcome measure, the risk of bias (135 studies) was assessed and outcome data were collected for meta-analysis (151 studies). Random-effects meta-analyses were performed, using cartilage regeneration as outcome measure on an absolute 0-100% scale. Implantation of acellular biomaterials significantly improved cartilage regeneration by 15.6% compared to non-treated empty defect controls. The addition of biologics to biomaterials significantly improved cartilage regeneration by 7.6% compared to control biomaterials. No significant differences were found between biomaterials from natural or synthetic origin or between scaffolds, hydrogels and blends. No noticeable differences were found in outcome between animal models. The risk of bias assessment indicated poor reporting for the majority of studies, impeding an assessment of the actual risk of bias. In conclusion, implantation of biomaterials in osteochondral defects improves cartilage regeneration compared to natural healing, which is further improved by the incorporation of biologics.",0

Counting windows were systematically selected and converted into image files (40-50 per defect). The quantification was performed by two-step point counting: (1) calculation of defect volume and (2) quantitative analysis of tissue composition. Step 2 was performed by assigning each point to one of the following categories based on validated and easy distinguishable morphological characteristics: (1) hyaline cartilage (rounded cells in lacunae in hyaline matrix), (2) fibrocartilage (rounded cells in lacunae in fibrous matrix), (3) fibrous tissue (elongated cells in fibrous tissue), (4) bone, (5) scaffold material, and (6) others. The ability to discriminate between the tissue types was determined using conventional or polarized light microscopy, and the interobserver variability was evaluated.We describe the application of the stereological method. In the example, we assessed the defect repair tissue volume to be 4.4 mm(3) (CE = 0.01). The tissue fractions were subsequently evaluated. Polarized light illumination of the slides improved discrimination between hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage and increased the interobserver agreement compared with conventional transmitted light.We have applied a design-unbiased method for quantitative evaluation of cartilage repair, and we propose this algorithm as a natural supplement to existing descriptive semiquantitative scoring systems. We also propose that polarized light is effective for discrimination between hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage.",0

Symptomatic grade III/IV damage requires surgical treatment. There are special challenges involved in cartilage damage in the patellofemoral joint as the complicated biomechanics of the joint is often combined with dysplasia. All tissue regeneration measures are based on the recruitment of cells. The synovial cells available in the joint can be differentiated to fibrous cartilage under certain mechanical conditions; however, they cannot sufficiently fill in defects. Also the use of bone marrow cells for cartilage reconstruction only creates mechanically inferior fibrous cartilage (Pridie drillings, microfracture, AMIC). Presently only cultivated, autologous chondrocytes from the lab are available for a biomechanically high-quality reconstruction of the cartilage layer.The application of mesenchymal stem cells is a subject of extensive international research. However, the first experimental studies, after initial formation of cartilage, disappointingly show significant ossification. Essential conditions for a successful treatment of patellofemoral cartilage damage are the diagnosis of accompanying pathological conditions, selection of the right cartilage-regenerating procedure, sufficient removal of the basic pathological defect, and implementation of standardized rehabilitation.",0

Due to the lack of donor-site morbidity and the single-stage procedure cell-free scaffolds are an interesting alternative to cell-based procedures. But as currently mid- and long-term data are lacking, the aim of the present study was to present mid-term clinical, radiological and histological results of a cell-free collagen type I scaffolds for cartilage repair.Materials and methodsTwenty-eight patients were followed prospectively. Clinical evaluation using patient-reported outcome measures (KOOS, IKDC; VAS for pain, Tegner score for activity) as well as radiologic evaluation of the repair tissue (MOCART) was performed at 1year, 2years and 5years. Histologic evaluation of the repair tissue was done in case of revision surgery using the ICRS II score for human cartilage repair.ResultsIn these large cartilage defects with a mean defect size of 3.71.9cm(2), clinical failure necessitating revision surgery was seen in 5 of 28 patients (18%). While the remaining patients showed good-to-excellent clinical results (KOOS, IKDC, VAS, Tegner), the radiologic appearance of the repair tissue showed a reduction of the MOCART score between the 2- and 5-year follow-up. Histologic evaluation of the repair tissue showed a cartilage-like appearance with no signs of inflammation or cell death but an overall medium tissue quality according to the ICRS II Score.Conclusion p id=Par4 The use of this cell-free collagen type I scaffold for large defects showed increased wear of the repair tissue and clinical failure in 18% of cases at 5-year follow-up.",0

Autologous cell-based cartilage repair, for example, autologous chondrocyte implantation, is limited by the need for ex vivo chondrocyte expansion and donor site morbidity. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), owing to their relative ease of isolation, higher replication activity, and chondrogenic potential, represent an alternative reparative cell type. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous, growth factor-rich biologic preparation that has recently received increasing attention and use as a therapeutic adjunct for the treatment of degenerative joint diseases, and there is evidence suggesting that PRP acts by promoting stem cell proliferation and tissue healing. In this study, we have examined the effect of PRP treatment on chondrogenic differentiation of adult human MSCs derived from infrapatellar fat pad-adipose stem cells (IFP-ASCs) and bone marrow (BM-MSCs). Both cell types were placed in high-density pellet culture and hydrogel-encapsulated culture under chondrogenic conditions. Our results showed that PRP did not improve IFP-ASC or BM-MSC chondrogenesis. In general, chondrogenesis was inhibited with increasing PRP concentrations and duration of exposure, on the basis of histological, biochemical, and gene expression analyses. Taken together, these findings suggest that although PRP is reported to be beneficial in terms of pain relief and joint function improvement, its mechanism of action is unlikely to directly involve enhancement of MSC-mediated hyaline cartilage formation.",0

To observe the efficacy of Alg-Gel-ADSCs MSs in repairing articular cartilage defects in SD rats.ADSCs were isolated and characterized by performing induced differentiation and flow cytometry assays. Alginate-gelatine microspheres with different gelatine concentrations were manufactured by electrospraying, and the appropriate alginate-gelatine concentration and ratio were determined by evaluating microsphere formation. Alg-Gel-ADSCs MSs were compared with Alg-ADSCs MSs through the induction of chondrogenic differentiation and culture. Their feasibility for cartilage tissue engineering was analysed by performing Live/Dead staining, cell proliferation analysis, toluidine blue staining and a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content analysis. Alg-Gel-ADSCs MSs were implanted in the cartilage defects of SD rats, and the cartilage repair effect was evaluated at different time points. The evaluation included gross observations and histological evaluations, fluorescence imaging tracking, immunohistochemical staining, microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and a CatWalk evaluation.The isolated ADSCs showed multidirectional differentiation and were used for cartilage tissue engineering. Using 1.5 w:v% alginate and 0.5 w:v% gelatine (Type B), we successfully prepared nearly spherical microspheres. Compared with alginate microspheres, alginate gel increased the viability of ADSCs and promoted the proliferation and chondrogenesis of ADSCs. In our experiments on knee cartilage defects in SD rats in vivo, the Alg-Gel-ADSCs MSs showed superior cartilage repair in cell resides, histology evaluation, micro-CT imaging and gait analysis.Microspheres composed of 1.5 w:v% alginate-0.5 w:v% gelatine increase the viability of ADSCs and supported their proliferation and deposition of cartilage matrix components. ADSCs embedded in 1.5 w:v% alginate-0.5 w:v% gelatine microspheres show superior repair efficacy and prospective applications in cartilage tissue repair.In this study, injectable adipose-derived stem cells-embedded alginate-gelatin microspheres (Alg-Gel-ADSCs MSs) were prepared by the electrospray . Compared with the traditional alginate microspheres, its support ability for ADSCs is better and shows a better repair effect.

The forces were recorded for an intact femoral condyle, as well as a standardized cartilage defect of 25 × 20 mm, after matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation (m-ACI) (BioSeed C; Biotissue Technologies, Freiburg, Germany), fixed by use of a conventional suture technique and pin fixation with a biodegradable pin perpendicular and 30° tilted to the matrix surface.In knees with cartilage defects, the peak compression forces (mean, 824 kPa) were significantly increased compared with the intact knee joint (564 kPa). After m-ACI implantation with a chondral suture (581.3 kPa) and perpendicular pin fixation, the joint compression forces of the cartilage defect were significantly decreased (630.7 kPa). There were no significant differences compared with the intact knee. After 30° tilted pin insertion, mean joint compression forces were significantly increased (1,740 kPa).This study shows that after chondral suture and perpendicular pin fixation, there are no increased compression forces in the knee joint in comparison to an intact knee. Thirty degree tilted pin insertion contributes to increased joint compression forces.A tilted insertion during pin fixation in m-ACI should be avoided because it may lead to increased joint compression forces, especially after cartilage defect lesions on the tibial side.",0

In 6 adult Goettinger minipigs, three full-thickness chondral defects were created in the trochlear groove of one knee of the hind leg. These defects were treated with a cell-free collagen type-I gel plug of 8, 10, or 12 mm diameter. All animals were allowed unlimited weight bearing. After 1 year, the animals were killed. Immediately after recovery, a non-destructive biomechanical testing was performed. The repair tissue quality was evaluated immunohistologically, collagen type-II protein was quantified, and a semiquantitative score (O'Driscoll score) was calculated. After 1 year, a high number of cells migrated into the initially cell-free collagen gel plugs and a hyaline-like repair tissue had been created. The O'Driscoll scores were: 8 mm, 21.2 (SD, 2.8); 10 mm, 21.5 (SD, 1.6); and 12 mm, 22.3 (SD, 1.0). The determination of the e-modulus, creep and relaxation revealed that mechanical properties of the two smaller defects were closer to unaffected hyaline cartilage. As cell-free collagen type-I gel plugs of all three different sizes created hyaline-like repair tissue, this system seems suitable for the treatment of even larger defects.",0

Two cylindrical OC defects (7 mm diameter, full cartilage thickness and 1mm into subchondral bone) were surgically created in the right stifle: one in the medial femoral condyle (MFC) and the other in the trochlear groove (TG). The implant matrices (non-woven or foam) were secured in the defect using a bottom anchored fixation device (FD). The contralateral left stifles served as time zero controls. At the day of necropsy, implants were placed at both defect sites (MFC and TG) on the normal left stifles. Following necropsy, the ex vivo goat stifles (intact and encapsulated) were disarticulated. Within 24 h postnecropsy, MR scans of the stifles along the mid-sagittal plane of the OC defect were acquired at 8 T and 1.5 T. MR relaxation times, T1 and T2, were measured at the region of repair tissue (RT) and adjacent native cartilage. Immediately after MR imaging, the stifles were dissected, grossly examined, and a sagittal OC block corresponding to the MR region of interest was prepared for formalin fixation.The high-resolution MR images enabled visualization of cartilage and bone integrity surrounding the implant as well as delineating the margins of RT/implant matrix and the FD. On spin echo sequence, the RT variably appeared as high, intermediate or low MR signal intensity; whereas, the FD always appeared as low signal intensity. In general, the MR signal intensity of 8-week RT was slightly higher compared to 16-week RT; however, there was no difference in RT morphology of stifles implanted with the non-woven matrix or foam matrix. Subchondral sclerosis appeared as low signal intensity. The 8 T MR images showed better delineation of the stifle tissues compared to the images acquired at 1.5 T. The T2 relaxation time of the RT appears to indicate (inconclusive due to small number of samples) a slight variation in the RT type between 8 weeks and 16 weeks. At both study times, the defects grossly appeared whitish to reddish but did not have the characteristic hyaline appearance typical of articular cartilage (AC). The gross appearance of the MFC and TG RT differed, which was predominantly mottled and recessed with fissuring of adjacent native AC in the MFC. Histologically, the RT of both 8-week and 16-week postsurgical defects predominantly comprised fibrovascular connective tissue with only few samples showing the presence of fibrocartilaginous and/or hypertrophic chondrocytes within the defect RT at 8 weeks. Also, compared to 8-week, the 16-week RT appeared to be more fibrotic.Using 8 T scanner, high-resolution MR images of ex vivo encapsulated goat stifles confirmed the capability of high-field MR imaging to distinguish the defect RT from the FD and adjacent joint tissues. The extent of OC repair and adjacent bone lesions (at 8 weeks and 16 weeks) observed in the MR images compared well with those observed on the corresponding histological sections.",0

Therapy of this condition is a topic of constant debate and a variety of chondral repair strategies are currently used. One strategy involves implantation of a cell-free matrix of type I collagen (COL1), to provide a scaffold for chondrocyte migration and proliferation and extracellular matrix production. Although several studies have suggested that chondrocytes can move, to the best of our knowledge there is still no proof of chondrocyte occurrence in a former cell-free scaffold for articular cartilage repair in humans.An 18-year-old male patient underwent arthroscopic surgery of the knee for patellar instability and a chondral defect of the femoral condyle. Clinical outcome scores were recorded pre-operatively, after 6 weeks and after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. MRI was recorded after 6 weeks and after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months postoperatively. At 42 months after implantation of a cell-free type I collagen matrix and reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament, the patient was again treated arthroscopically for a tear of the medial meniscus of the same knee. A biopsy of the previous chondral defect was taken during arthroscopy for histological examination.In addition to good clinical and radiological results reported for cell-free scaffolds for cartilage repair in several other studies, transformation of the scaffold could be observed during re-arthroscopy for the meniscal tear. Histological examination of the specimen revealed articular cartilage with vital chondrocytes and a strong staining reaction for type II collagen (COL II), but no reaction for type I collagen staining. This might indicate a complete transformation of the scaffold and supports the theory that cell free scaffolds could support cell migration. Although the cell source remains unclear, migrating chondrocytes from the periphery remain a possibility.",0
868,https://openalex.org/W1561858686,https://doi.org/10.1186/ar1709,,"Autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) has been shown, in long-term follow-up studies, to be a promising treatment for the repair of isolated cartilage lesions. The method is based on an implantation of in vitro expanded chondrocytes originating from a small cartilage biopsy harvested from a non-weight-bearing area within the joint. In patients with osteoarthritis (OA), there is a need for the resurfacing of large areas, which could potentially be made by using a scaffold in combination with culture-expanded cells. As a first step towards a cell-based therapy for OA, we therefore investigated the expansion and redifferentiation potential in vitro of chondrocytes isolated from patients undergoing total knee replacement. The results demonstrate that OA chondrocytes have a good proliferation potential and are able to redifferentiate in a three-dimensional pellet model. During the redifferentiation, the OA cells expressed increasing amounts of DNA and proteoglycans, and at day 14 the cells from all donors contained type II collagen-rich matrix. The accumulation of proteoglycans was in comparable amounts to those from ACT donors, whereas total collagen was significantly lower in all of the redifferentiated OA chondrocytes. When the OA chondrocytes were loaded into a scaffold based on hyaluronic acid, they bound to the scaffold and produced cartilage-specific matrix proteins. Thus, autologous chondrocytes are a potential source for the biological treatment of OA patients but the limited collagen synthesis of the OA chondrocytes needs to be further explained.",0

The interventional procedures that have been developed for the repair of such lesions include abrasion, microfracture, autologous osteochondral transplantation, allograft transplantation, and autologous chondrocyte implantation. An accurate imaging assessment of the repair tissue is necessary in order to objectively evaluate the postoperative outcome. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and arthroscopy provide complementary information and are especially useful for follow-up evaluation of cartilage repair in the knee and ankle. Standard MR imaging techniques may be used postoperatively to evaluate the success of implantation and the state of cartilage healing. Newer matrix assessment techniques, which include delayed gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging and mapping of T1rho and T2 values, may provide useful supplemental information about the histologic and biochemical contents of reparative tissue. The normal postoperative appearance of the joints after cartilage repair varies according to the surgical technique used and the stage of healing. To identify potential complications, it is important to be familiar with the various repair procedures and the characteristic MR imaging features of the repair tissue at various postoperative intervals.",0

Techniques 1 (pin) and 2 (transosseous anchoring) can be used arthroscopically.Maximum load and yield load were significantly higher in the group 1 (pin fixation) and group 2 (transosseous anchoring) compared to group 3 (conventional suture). Stiffness was significantly higher in group 1 than in groups 2 or 3.Our biomechanical data show that two fixation techniques (pin fixation and transosseous anchoring) have a higher ultimate load, yield load, and stiffness than the conventional suture technique at time point zero. However, these data can be interpreted only with the Bioceed-C matrix (BioTissue Technologies GmbH, Freiburg, Germany).Our biomechanical data show outstanding fixation strength with arthroscopic techniques that use Bioceed-C matrix scaffolds during autologous chondrocyte transplantation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological response to this procedure. Design Patients presenting with symptomatic mono- or bicompartmental arthrosis and varus malalignment underwent IA and concurrent medial open wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO). A subset of patients required hardware removal and consented to second-look arthroscopy without biopsy allowing for assessment of IA components and compartment-specific findings related to implant fixation, cartilage flow, propagation of lesions, and opposing tibial surfaces. Results In a series of 41 knees (35 patients) treated with combined IA and HTO (mean varus &gt;7°), 26 knees (23 patients, 18 male, 5 female) with a mean age of 52 years (range = 43-67) required HTO plate removal. Concurrent second look arthroscopy was performed at a mean of 14 months (range = 12-19) following the index procedure. On probing, all arthroplasty components showed solid fixation without gap formation. On the medial femoral condyle, 15 mm implants ( n = 14) showed a peripheral cartilage flow of 12% (range = 5% to 25%), 20 mm implants ( n = 12) of 9% (range 5% to 15%), and trochlear implants ( n = 12) of 20% (range 10% to 40%). No progressive deterioration of the index defects or progression of tibial and retropatellar grades were seen. Conclusion Joint surface reconstruction using IA showed stable fixation with peripheral cartilage coverage ranging from 9% to 20% and no further chondral damage on opposing surfaces. Future clinical effectiveness studies are required to support the positive biological integration.",0

Studies reported on patient clinical scores such as Hospital for Special Surgery score, Knee Society Score (knee and function score), and Lysholm score. Reoperation and failure rates were recorded for each study. Modified Coleman Methodology Scores assessed study methodological quality.Five studies with a total of 291 patients (55% male, 45% female) and average age of 34.8 years (range, 15 to 69 years) were included. Of all lesions, 67% were on the femoral condyles, 29% on the tibial plateau, and 4% were patellofemoral. All scores (Knee Society Function Score, Knee Society Knee Score, and Lysholm score) have significant mean improvement from preoperative to final follow-up. The mean postoperative Hospital for Special Surgery score was 84.1. The mean failure rate was 25% at 12.3 years with a reoperation rate of 36%. A total of 72% of the failures were conversion to total (68%) or unicompartmental (4%) knee arthroplasty and 28% involved graft removal, graft fixation, and graft revision. Patellofemoral lesions (83%) had a significantly higher reoperation rate than lesions involving the tibial plateau or the femoral condyles (34%, P = .01).Overall, OCA demonstrated significant improvements in clinical outcome scores and good durability with successful outcomes in 75% of the patients at 12.3 years after surgery. Patellofemoral lesions are associated with decreased clinical improvement and more frequent reoperations. The orthopaedic literature is limited by heterogeneity in surgical technique, lesion and patient characteristics, and reporting of nonstandardized outcome measures.Level IV, systematic review of Level II and IV studies.",0

Hypothesis Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound accelerates healing of bone-to-tendon junction repair by promoting osteogenesis and tissue remodeling at the healing junction. Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Methods Standard partial patellectomy was conducted in forty-eight 18-week-old rabbits divided into an ultrasound treatment and control group. Daily ultrasound was delivered 3 days after surgery onto the patellar tendon–patella healing junction and continuously up to weeks 2, 4, 8, and 16 postoperatively, when the patella–patellar tendon complexes were harvested for radiographic, histologic, and biomechanical evaluations. Results Radiographic measurements showed significantly more newly formed bone at the patellar tendon–patella healing junction in the ultrasound group compared with the controls at week 8 (4.91 ± 2.74 mm 2 vs 2.50 ± 1.83 mm 2 , P &lt; .05) and week 16 (7.22 ± 2.34 mm 2 vs 4.61 ± 2.22 mm 2 , P &lt; .05) after partial patellectomy. Histologically, the ultrasound group at weeks 8 and 16 showed improved tissue integration, characterized by trabecular bone expansion from the remaining patella and regeneration of fibrocartilage layer at the patellar tendon–patella healing junction. Fluorescence microscopy revealed earlier bone formation in the ultrasound group when compared with the controls at week 8 (1.78 ± 0.32 vs 1.23 ± 0.43, P &lt; .01) and week 16 (2.10 ± 0.67 vs 1.29 ± 0.35, P &lt; .01). Mechanical testing showed significantly higher failure load and ultimate strength in the ultrasound group (300.2 ± 61.7 N and 7.10 ± 1.29 MPa, respectively) as compared with controls (222.3 ± 65.1 N and 5.26 ± 1.36 MPa, respectively) at week 16 (P &lt; .05 for both). Conclusion Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound was able to accelerate bone-to-tendon junction repair. Clinical Relevance These results may help establish treatment efficacy for accelerating bone-to-tendon junction repair and facilitating earlier rehabilitation.",0

OCD is seen in children and adolescents with open growth plates (juvenile OCD) and adults with closed growth plates (adult OCD). The etiology of OCD lesions remains unclear and is characterized by an aseptic necrosis in the subchondral bone area. Mechanical factors seem to play an important role. Clinical symptoms are unspecific. Thus, imaging techniques are most important. Regarding treatment, a tremendous number of publications exist. Spontaneous healing is expected unless there is an unstable fragment, and treatment involves rest and different degrees of immobilization until healing. Patients with open physes and low-grade lesions have good results with conservative therapy. When surgery is necessary, the procedure depends on the stage and on the state of the cartilage. With intact cartilage, retrograde procedures are favorable. When the cartilage is damaged, several techniques can be used. While techniques such as drilling and microfracturing produce reparative cartilage, other techniques reconstruct the defect with additional osteochondral grafts or cell-based procedures such as chondrocyte transplantation. There is a tendency toward better results when using procedures that reconstruct the bone and the cartilage and there is also a trend toward better long-term results when comorbidities are treated. Severe grades of osteoarthrosis are rare.",0

Repair strategies vary widely, including microfracture, autologous or allogenic tissue implantation, and in vitro engineered tissues of autologous origin. However, unlike the advances that have been made over more than two decades with more complex organs, including vascular, cardiac or bone tissues, similar advances in tissue engineering for cartilage repair are lacking. Although the inherent characteristics of cartilage tissue, such as the lack of vascularity and low cellular diversity, suggest that it would be one of the more simple tissues to be engineered, its functional weight-bearing role and implant viability and adaptation make this type of repair more complex. Over the last decade several therapeutic approaches and innovative techniques show promise for lasting and functional regeneration of hyaline cartilage.

However, pannus-like tissue has also been found in osteoarthritis (OA). Our previous study showed that pannus-like tissue in OA (OA pannus) was frequently found in human OA samples. The purpose of the study is to investigate the development and the characteristics of OA pannus in a rat OA model. Design Ligaments of the knee joint were transected in Wister rats to induce OA. The knee joints were removed at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6, and subjected to histological study. Samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Safranin-O and immuno-stained for vimentin, CD34, type II collagen and MMP-3. The whole knee joint of OA rats was implanted in SCID mice and kept for a further 3 weeks. Then the histological findings were evaluated in HE sections. Result OA pannus appeared at week 2 and extend over the articular surface. OA pannus cells were positive for vimentin and/or CD34. At week 6, a part of articular surface was restored with matrix. OA pannus cells expressed MMP-3 as well as type II collagen. Histological study of rat OA knees implanted in SCID mice showed that OA pannus cells filled the joint space and invaded articular cartilage. Conclusions The presence of OA pannus was found in a rat OA model and its features were similar to those in human OA. OA pannus had both catabolic and reparative features, and the latter feature were speculated to be dominant in the later phase of the disease under a certain environmental condition.",0

However, achieving a satisfying level of cell redifferentiation following expansion remains challenging. Hydrogels and perfusion bioreactors are known to exert beneficial cues on chondrocytes; however, the effect of a combined approach on the quality of cartilage matrix deposited by cells is not fully understood. Here, we combined soluble factors (BMP-2, Insulin, and Triiodothyronine, that is, BIT), fibrin hydrogel, direct perfusion and human articular chondrocytes (HACs) to engineer large cartilage tissues. Following cell expansion, cells were embedded in fibrin gels and cultivated under either static or perfusion conditions. The nature of the matrix synthesized was assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The stability of cartilage grafts and integration with native tissue were also investigated by subcutaneous implantation of human osteochondral cylinders in nude mice. Perfusion preconditioning improved matrix quality and spatial distribution. Specifically, perfusion preconditioning resulted in a matrix rich in type II collagen but not in type I collagen, indicating the reconstruction of hyaline cartilage. Remarkably, the production of type VI collagen, the main component of the pericellular matrix, was also increased, indicating that chondrocytes were connecting to the hyaline matrix they produced.",0

The purpose of this study was to document methods for evaluating concomitant procedures of the knee when performed with articular cartilage restoration techniques, and to review their reported findings in high-impact clinical orthopedic studies. We hypothesized that there are substantial inconsistencies in reporting clinical outcomes associated with concomitant procedures relative to outcomes related to isolated cartilage repair.A total of 133 clinical studies on articular cartilage repair of the knee were identified from 6 high-impact orthopedic journals between 2011 and 2017. Studies were included if they were primary research articles reporting clinical outcomes data following surgical treatment of articular cartilage lesions with a minimum sample size of 5 patients. Studies were excluded if they were review articles, meta-analyses, and articles reporting only nonclinical outcomes (e.g., imaging, histology). A full-text review was then used to evaluate details regarding study methodology and reporting on the following variables: primary cartilage repair procedure, and the utilization of concomitant procedures to address additional patient comorbidities, including malalignment, meniscus pathology, and ligamentous instability. Each study was additionally reviewed to document variation in clinical outcomes reporting in patients that had these comorbidities addressed at the time of surgery.All studies reported on the type of primary cartilage repair procedure, with autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) noted in 43% of studies, microfracture (MF) reported in 16.5%, osteochondral allograft (OCA) in 15%, and osteochondral autograft transplant (OAT) in 8.2%. Regarding concomitant pathology, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (24.8%) and meniscus repair (23.3%) were the most commonly addressed patient comorbidities. A total of 56 studies (42.1%) excluded patients with malalignment, meniscus injury, and ligamentous instability. For studies that addressed concomitant pathology, 72.7% reported clinical outcomes separately from the cohort treated with only cartilage repair. A total of 16.5% of studies neither excluded nor addressed concomitant pathologies. There was a significant amount of variation in the patient reported outcome scores used among the studies, with the majority of studies reporting International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) in 47.2% and 43.6% of articles, respectively.In this study on knee cartilage restoration, recognition and management of concomitant pathology is inadequately reported in approximately 28% of studies. Only 30% of articles reported adequate treatment of concomitant ailments while scoring their outcomes using one of a potential 18 different scoring systems. These findings highlight the need for more standardized methods to be applied in future research with regard to inclusion, exclusion, and scoring concomitant pathologies with regard to treatment of cartilage defects in the knee.",0
887,https://openalex.org/W2440499723,,Has the Standard of the Reporting of Rehabilitation Improved in Articular Cartilage Repair Studies Involving Third-Generation Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation in the Knee? A Systematic Review.,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a tissue-engineered surgical technique initially developed for articular cartilage repair of isolated chondral lesions of the knee. Third generation techniques (ACI3) are now available that deliver autologous cultured chondrocytes into the defect using cell scaffolds. The successful outcomes of these techniques have some dependency on the pre and post-surgical patient rehabilitation.To determine if the standard of reporting for rehabilitation has improved in ACI3 studies; previous reviews in this field recommended describing the detail of this rehabilitation and patient compliance as integral elements.A computerized search was performed in March 2013. Criteria for inclusion were any studies that evaluated or described the process of ACI3 in the knee and subsequent rehabilitation. The modified Coleman Methodology Score (CMS) was used to rate the standard of reporting of rehabilitation and surgical procedures; review articles were also evaluated for quality using the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT). Mean scores, odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals and Mann-Whitney U statistics were calculated.An improvement in mean CMS was seen compared to previous reviews but rehabilitation reporting scores were lower than their surgical equivalent; significant association was seen between those studies with rehabilitator involvement and high scores in the individual CMS rehabilitation element. Predominant SORT scores of 2A indicated medium strength of recommendation.The CMS provides a general overview of methodological quality but a more specialised tool to report on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the rehabilitation process would assist in raising the standards. It is recommended that rehabilitation therapists are included as key members of research teams and are involved in the design, implementation and reporting of future studies.",0

We hypothesized that conventionally passaged SDSCs can be engineered in vitro into cartilage tissue constructs and the engineered premature tissue can be implanted to repair allogeneic full-thickness femoral condyle cartilage defects without immune rejection.Synovial tissue was harvested from rabbit knee joints. Passage 3 SDSCs were mixed with fibrin glue and seeded into non-woven polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh. After 1-month incubation with growth factor cocktails, the premature tissue was implanted into rabbit knees to repair osteochondral defects with Collagraft as a bone substitute in the Construct group. Fibrin glue-saturated PGA/Collagraft composites were used as a Scaffold group. The defect was left untreated as an Empty group.SDSCs were engineered in rotating bioreactor systems into premature cartilage, which displayed the expression of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG), collagen II, collagen I, and macrophages. Six months after implantation with premature tissue, cartilage defects were full of smooth hyaline-like cartilage with no detectable collagen I and macrophages but a high expression of collagen II and GAG, which were also integrated with the surrounding native cartilage. The Scaffold and Empty groups were resurfaced with fibrous-like and fibrocartilage tissue, respectively.Allogeneic SDSC-based premature tissue constructs are a promising stem cell-based approach for cartilage defects. Although in vitro data suggest that contaminated macrophages affected the quality of SDSC-based premature cartilage, effects of macrophages on in vivo tissue regeneration and integration necessitate further investigation.",0

Current treatment methods such as microfracture result in less resilient fibrocartilage with eventual failure; autografting can cause donor site morbidity and poor integration. To overcome drawbacks in treatment, tissue engineers can design cell-instructive biomimetic scaffolds using biocompatible materials as alternate therapies for osteochondral defects. Nanofibrous poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA) scaffolds of uniform, spherical, interconnected and well-defined pore sizes that are fabricated using a thermally-induced phase separation and sugar porogen template method create an extracellular matrix-like environment which facilitates cell adhesion and proliferation. Herein we report that chondrogenesis and endochondral ossification of rabbit and human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be controlled by scaffold pore architecture, particularly pore size. Small-pore scaffolds support enhanced chondrogenic differentiation in vitro and cartilage formation in vivo compared to large-pore scaffolds. Endochondral ossification is prevented in scaffolds with very small pore sizes; pore interconnectivity is critical to promote capillary ingrowth for mature bone formation. These results provide a novel strategy to control tissue regenerative processes by tunable architecture of macroporous nanofibrous scaffolds. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Progress in understanding the relationship between cell fate and architectural features of tissue engineering scaffolds is critical for engineering physiologically functional tissues. Sugar porogen template scaffolds have uniform, spherical, highly interconnected macropores. Tunable pore-size guides the fate of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) towards chondrogenesis and endochondral ossification, and is a critical design parameter to mediate neotissue vascularization. Preventing vascularization favors a chondrogenic cell fate while allowing vascularization results in endochondral ossification and mineralized bone formation. These results provide a novel strategy to control tissue regenerative processes by tunable architecture of macroporous nanofibrous scaffolds.",0

The type of study was case series. From October 1990 to June 1995, eight cases underwent allogenic or autogenic meniscus transplantations for articular cartilage defects, and seven cases were available for follow-up evaluations. The age at surgery ranged from 14 to 42 years of age (average 22.5). In one case, transplantation of tissue-engineered cartilage was performed due to pain 5 years after surgery. The other six cases were followed up for 8-13 years (average 10.1). The size of the cartilage defect ranged from 1.0 to 6.3 cm2 (average 2.8 cm2). Patients were evaluated with the Lysholm score and MR images. We also performed arthroscopic examinations in three cases at the final evaluation. This study leads to the conclusion that meniscus transplantation for articular cartilage damage is not comparable to autologous chondrocyte transplantation.

Autologous OC mosaicplasty has proven to be a valid therapeutic option but donor site morbidity and the lack of long-term functionality remain sources of concern. OC tissue engineering has shown an increasing development to provide suitable strategies for the regeneration of damaged cartilage and underlying subchondral bone tissue. The use of two scaffolds with optimized properties for bone and cartilage architectures combined at the time of implantation as a multilayered structure was one of the first approaches for OC large defects regeneration. Last decade strategies using a bony-like scaffold supporting a cell layer for cartilage phase were introduced. Beyond the approaches already mentioned, three other strategies were reported for OCD regeneration. One methodology was the use of two different layers with a compact interface to create an integrated bilayered scaffold before cell seeding. A second strategy was the use of a single continuous structure but with different features in each layer. The last one was the combination of hydrogel phases creating this way the possibility to have injectable systems. These promising strategies for the regeneration of complex OCDs comprise the use of different biomaterials, growth factors, and cells alone or in combination, but the ideal solution is still to be found. The interface's mechanical properties have to be optimized. A different problem is related with the cell culture method within the 3D bilayered structures with heterogeneous properties. With the increasing demand of these stratified 3D structures new cell culture systems are required. Moreover these structures present the potential to be used as in vitro models, which is a need also because of the pressure resulting from the 3R's principle implementation that is now occurring. Regarding this, adapted bioreactors are being developed, but more efforts are required to target this scientific demand.",0

However, achieving reconstitution of actual physiologically relevant, appropriately-laminated cartilage in situ that would be applicable to conditions, such as arthritis and cartilage degeneration remains elusive.

Gene therapy involves the introduction of genetic information in the injured tissue to help that tissue to heal and, possibly, regenerate. Cell therapies used in clinical practice are based on the transplantation of adult human cells, which can be at different stages of differentiation. Currently, the stromal vascular fraction, containing stem cells and other niche components, has been injected in the articular cartilage of the knee or delivered via arthroscopy. Bone marrow concentrate (BMC) has been used to manage focal chondral defects via arthroscopy with promising clinical results. In addition, purified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been injected or delivered as an adjuvant to arthroscopic microfractures, and patients have shown improved clinical outcomes. Laboratory-expanded MSCs injected in osteoarthritis moderately improved pain and functional outcomes. MSC treatment in the form of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) or BMC or laboratory expanded adhesive cells (bone marrow and adipose derived stem cells, BM-MSCs and ADSCs) has been proven to be safe. Despite their safety, expensive regulatory complexities required to implement cell-based therapies make these treatments unavailable for most patients.

Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and human chondrocytes were seeded on solid and pre-solid atelocollagen scaffolds. Cell-scaffold constructs were cultured for 7 days and then prepared for histological analyses. Arthroscopic ACIC was performed in five patients affected by chondral lesions of the talus; they were clinically evaluated with AOFAS, VAS and Tegner score before and then after 6 months from surgery. In vitro results showed that both bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocytes were able to efficiently colonize the whole construct, from the surface to the core, only when seeded on the pre-solid atelocollagen scaffold, but not on its solid form. No adverse events were observed in the patients treated with the ACIC technique; a significant improvement in VAS pain scale and in AOFAS score was found at 6 months follow up. Injectable atelocollagen can be considered a feasible scaffold for cartilage repair treatment, in particular if used in its pre-solid form. ACIC leads to good clinical results in the treatment for chondral lesions of the talus even if longer follow-up and a higher number of patients are necessary to confirm these data. IV.",0

Since the number of progenitors in Mfx is low and may further decrease with age, aim of our study was to analyze the chondrogenic potential of freeze-dried polyglycolic acid-hyaluronan (PGA-HA) implants preloaded with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro and in a rabbit articular cartilage defect model. Human bone marrow-derived MSC from iliac crest were cultured in freeze-dried PGA-HA implants for chondrogenic differentiation. In a pilot study, implants were loaded with autologous rabbit MSC and used to cover 5 mm × 6 mm full-thickness femoral articular cartilage defects (n = 4). Untreated defects (n = 3) served as controls. Gene expression analysis and histology showed induction of typical chondrogenic marker genes like type II collagen and formation of hyaline-like cartilaginous tissue in MSC-laden PGA-HA implants. Histological evaluation of rabbit repair tissue formation after 30 and 45 days showed formation of repair tissue, rich in chondrocytic cells and of a hyaline-like appearance. Controls showed no articular resurfacing, tissue repair in the subchondral zone and fibrin formation. These results suggest that MSC-laden PGA-HA scaffolds have chondrogenic potential and are a promising option for stem cell-mediated cartilage regeneration. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

All documented autologous chondrocyte implantation, autologous osteochondral transfer, osteochondral allograft transplantation, and marrow stimulation techniques (MSTs) procedures were analyzed. Analysis was performed to describe trends in annual incidence, types of complications, concomitant procedures, and geographical differences in incidence of advanced cartilage procedures.From 2003 to 2015, a total of 2,827 surgeons submitted 7,522 cartilage restoration procedures, with 7,060 cases documented as MST (80.01%). The number of cartilage cases decreased significantly from 2003 to in 2015 (P <.001), with MST having the largest decline (P < .001). The incidence of open osteochondral allograft transplantation (odds ratio = 1.35; P = .023) and open autologous osteochondral transfer (odds ratio = 0.84; P = .004) increased over the study period. Overall, the majority of patients (57.0%) were male; however, female patients were on average significantly older than male patients (P < .001). Cartilage procedures were performed concomitantly with a realignment osteotomy procedure in 1.7% of cases. The incidence of surgical complications increased throughout the study period from 2.9% in 2003 to 9.5% in 2015 (P < .001).Cartilage restoration procedures, specifically MSTs, are being decreasingly performed among recently trained orthopaedic surgeons. In contrast, complication rates have been increasing since 2003, demonstrating a possible paradigm shift toward more complex cartilage procedures, specifically osteochondral grafting procedures.This study demonstrates a significant decline in the use of MSTs by recently trained orthopaedic surgeons. In addition, an increase in several more complex cartilage restoration procedures was found. Taken in sum, these changes may reflect a shift in residency and fellowship training away from marrow stimulation procedures that elicit a fibrocartilage reparative tissue and toward more complex procedures that provide a more hyaline-like articular cartilage surface.",0

The aim of this study is to assess the outcome of patients treated with differentiated to chondrocytes bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) cultured on a collagen type I/III (Chondro-Gide®) scaffold. The secondary aim was to confirm the absence of adverse events. Methods Fifteen patients (19 knees) with symptomatic full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee were enrolled. Bone marrow was harvested from the iliac crest, BM-MSCs were prepared, and expanded cells were grown in a standard medium or in a standard culture medium containing TGF-β. BM-MSCs differentiated to chondrocytes were seeded in a porcine collagen type I/III scaffold (Chondro-Gide®) and cultured in TGF-β containing media. After 4 weeks, the membrane was sutured on the cartilage defect. All patients underwent plain radiographs (antero-posterior, lateral, and axial view of the patella) and MRI of the affected knee. The Oxford knee score, the Lyhsolm scale, and the VAS score were administered to all patients. At final follow-up a MRI for the study of articular cartilage was undertaken. Results The mean size of the cartilage lesions was 20 × 17 mm (range, 15 × 10 mm–30 × 30 mm). At final follow-up, the median Oxford knee score and Lyhsolm scale scores significantly improved from 29 (range 12–39; SD 7.39) to 45 (range 24–48; SD 5.6) and from 55.5 (range 25–81; SD 17.7) to 94.5 (58–100; SD 10.8), respectively. Pain, according to the VAS score, significantly improved. Sixty percent of patients reported their satisfaction as excellent, 20% as good, 14% as fair, and 1 patient as poor. Conclusion The treatment of full-thickness chondral injuries of the knee with differentiated to chondrocytes BM-MSCs and Chondro-Gide® scaffold showed encouraging outcomes. Further studies involving more patients, and with longer follow-up, are required to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and the long-term results.",0

Due to the bradytrophic character of hyaline cartilage, these lesions are hardly repaired by the organism. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) was established for restoring isolated structural cartilage defects in knee joints. However, results are not always convincing. Human chondrocytes from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were cultured in monolayer followed by condensing single chondrocytes to spheroids (chondrospheres®). The integrative capacity of chondrospheres was examined by implanting them into lesions in human articular cartilage specimens and co-implanting them into SCID mice. Mice were sacrificed after 4, 12 and 24 weeks. HE and safranin O staining as well as immunohistochemistry using anti-S100, anti-collagen I and II antibodies were performed and analyzed using semiquantitative scores. Integration of the chondrospheres with the (native) cartilage matrix was analyzed by determining the percentage of adhering surface. With respect to long-term stability, the chondrocytes within chondrospheres showed a typical chondrocytic morphology. Immunohistochemically, a high collagen II production was detected. Over a time period of 24 weeks, an increasing content of collagen type II, glycosaminoglycans and collagenous fibers were found. Importantly, the newly synthesized cartilaginous matrix integrated continuously with the native cartilage lesion border. In conclusion, the presented data demonstrate that chondrospheres are able to restore and conserve their phenotype for at least 24 weeks under in vivo conditions. Moreover, chondrospheres adhere to full-thickness cartilage defects and appear to produce a cartilaginous extracellular matrix which fuses with native cartilage thus generating an autologous cartilage-like repair tissue.",0

Methods A systematic electronic search of the PubMed database and the Cochrane Library was performed in April 2017 to identify studies that reported clinical or radiographic outcome of focal metallic inlay resurfacing prosthesis for the treatment of isolated cartilage defects of the femoral condyles. Included studies were abstracted regarding study characteristics, patient demographics, prosthetic device and location, indications and contraindications, and outcome measures. Outcome of interest included functional outcome scores, radiographic measures, complications, re-operations, and conversion to arthroplasty. The methodologic quality of the included studies was assessed with the Coleman Methodology Score. Results Six studies with a total of 186 patients met the inclusion criteria. Five studies were level IV evidence, and one was level III. The methodologic quality of the included studies was good, with a mean Coleman Methodology Score of 78. Two different implants were used: the HemiCAP (R) (five studies; 66% of study group) and UniCAP (R) (one study; 34%) implant. The mean age was 46-54 years, and the mean follow-up was 24 months to 7 years. Pre- and post-operative outcome scores were compared in all six studies, and five studies reported significant improvements at the final follow-up for all scores (objective und functional KSS, KOOS, WOMAC, Tegner, HSS Knee and Function score, SF-36 and SF-12 physical component score) except for the SF-36 and SF-12 mental component score. Progression of osteoarthritis was analysed using the Kellgren-Lawrence grading in three studies (30% of study group), with two studies reporting significant progression. The OARSI grading system was analysed in one study with no significant progression. The overall conversion rate to arthroplasty was 22% with considerable differences between the two implants: 9% for HemiCAP (R) and 47% for UniCAP (R). Conclusions Focal metallic inlay resurfacing prosthesis seems to be a viable option for a carefully selected group of patients. Significant improvement in knee function and pain was observed in most patients. Uncertainty remains with regard to progression of osteoarthritis because of conflicting results and inconsistent reporting. One out of five patients has to be converted to arthroplasty after an average of 4 years. However, compared to the UniCAP (R) implant, considerable lower conversion rates were reported for the smaller HemiCAP (R) implant.",0

However, allografts and synthetic implants have major drawbacks such as the limited supply of grafts and lack of integration into host tissue, respectively. In this study, we investigated the effects of conditioned medium (CM) from meniscal fibrochondrocytes and TGF-β3 on tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (T-MSCs) for meniscus tissue engineering. CM-expanded T-MSCs were encapsulated in riboflavin-induced photocrosslinked collagen-hyaluronic acid (COL-RF-HA) hydrogels and cultured in chondrogenic medium containing TGF-β3. In vitro results indicate that CM-expanded cells followed by TGF-β3 exposure stimulated the expression of fibrocartilage-related genes (COL2, SOX9, ACAN, COL1) and production of extracellular matrix components. Histological assessment of in vitro and subcutaneously implanted in vivo constructs demonstrated that CM-expanded cells followed by TGF-β3 exposure resulted in highest cell proliferation, GAG accumulation, and collagen deposition. Furthermore, when implanted into meniscus defect model, CM treatment amplified the potential of TGF-β3 and induced complete regeneration.Conditioned medium derived from chondrocytes have been reported to effectively prime mesenchymal stem cells toward chondrogenic lineage. Type I collagen is the main component of meniscus extracellular matrix and hyaluronic acid is known to promote meniscus regeneration. In this manuscript, we investigated the effects of conditioned medium (CM) and transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3) on tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (T-MSCs) encapsulated in riboflavin-induced photocrosslinked collagen-hyaluronic acid (COL-RF-HA) hydrogel. We employed a novel source of conditioned medium, derived from meniscal fibrochondrocytes. Our in vitro and in vivo results collectively illustrate that CM-expanded cells followed by TGF-β3 exposure have the best potential for meniscus regeneration. This manuscript highlights a novel stem cell commitment strategy combined with biomaterials designs for meniscus regeneration.",0
924,https://openalex.org/W2395768793,,Transplantation of deep frozen menisci,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Subtotal or total meniscectomy will increase weight-bearing per square unit of the cartilage surface approximately threeand- half-times. A long-term overloading of cartilage is clinically manifested by pain, swelling and a rapid onset of early arthritic lesions discernible on radiograms. One of the options for the treatment of degenerative changes in the joint is meniscal transplant. The authors present their first experience with the transplantation of deep frozen meniscal tissue in the Czech Republic. MATERIAL By September 2006, we had treated 26 patients with clinical problems following subtotal or total meniscectomy. The patients, 15 women and 11 men, were between 24 and 46 years of age. Eighteen patients underwent transplantation of the medial meniscus and eight received a lateral meniscal transplant. Concomitant repair of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) was indicated in 11 patients, of whom 10 were treated with semitendinosus tendon graft and one with patellar ligament allograft. One patient with a lateral meniscal transplant and ACL reconstruction also had suture of the medial meniscus for a previously sustained injury. In 16 patients, chondromalacia was at the level of Outerbridge grade II and, only in five patients, the finding was Outerbridge grade I. Five patients with grade III chondromalacia were treated using the microfracture technique. Valgus or varus osteotomy was not indicated at all. METHODS The goal of meniscal transplant surgery is: 1) to relieve pain after meniscectomy; 2) to prevent degenerative changes of cartilage; 3) to eliminate or reduce the risk of development of osteoarthritic lesions; 4) to restore normal mechanics of the knee joint. Patient selection is important and it is necessary to take into consideration: 1) level of cartilage degenerative changes; 2) knee alignment; 3) knee joint stability; 4) graft size. In patients with instability of the knee and indications for meniscal graft, it is necessary to stabilize the joint by ligament reconstruciton prior to transplantation; in the case of malalignment corrective osteotomy is required. RESULTS All patients healed without complications. At the end of the third follow-up month, the range of motion was S-0-0-130 in 22 patients and S-0-0-120 in three patients. Only one patient had the range of motion restricted to S-0-0-110. Evaluation showed improvement from pre-operative values to those at 6 months and two years post-operatively as follows: IKDS score, 57-64 to 73-80 to 76-84; Lysholm score, 50-76 to 80-90 to 85-95; and Tegner score, 2-4 to 4-7 to 5-8. No complications associated with meniscal transplant incorporation were recorded. Also in five patients with Outbridge grade III degenerative changes, meniscal transplantation was successfully carried out. In four patients, of which two had a cartilage defect treated, second-look arthroscopy showed that the lesions healed with healthy fibrocartilaginous tissue. CONCLUSIONS All patients reported resolution of subjective complaints, as seen from the results of the IKDC, Lysholm and Tegner scoring systems. It was obvious that when biomechanics of the knee joint were restored, conditions facilitating healing of chondral defects were provided. Based on this experience, the authors conclude that meniscal transplantation improves the quality of life in biologically young patients with clinical problems after meniscectomy.",0

They can occur after ankle trauma, such as sprains or fractures, but they usually present as a continued ankle pain after the initial injury has resolved. Chronic ankle ligament instability and subsequent microtrauma may lead to insidious development of an OLT. Medial-sided lesions are more common (67%) than lateral-sided lesions. For acute lesions that are nondisplaced, nonoperative management is initially performed, with a 4-6 week period of immobilization and protected weight bearing. Symptomatic improvement results in more than 50% of patients by 3 months. Acute osteochondral talus fractures, which have a bone fragment thickness greater than 3 mm with displacement will benefit from early surgical intervention. These injuries should undergo primary repair via internal fixation with bioabsorbable compression screws 3.0 mm or smaller using at least 2 points of fixation. Acute lesions that are too small for fixation can be treated with morselization and reimplantation of the cartilage fragments. If OLTs are persistently symptomatic following an appropriate course of nonoperative treatment, various reparative and restorative surgical options may be considered on the basis of diameter, surface area, depth, and location of the lesion. A small subset of symptomatic osteochondral lesions of the talus involve subchondral pathology with intact overlying articular cartilage; in these cases, retrograde drilling into the cystic lesion can be employed to induce underlying bony healing. Cancellous bone graft augmentation may be used for subchondral cysts with volume greater than 100 mm3 or with those with a depth of more than 10 mm. Debridement, curettage, and bone marrow stimulation is a reparative technique that may be considered in lesions demonstrating a diameter less than 10 mm, with surface area less than 100 mm2, and a depth less than 5 mm. This technique is commonly performed arthroscopically using curettes and an arthroscopic shaver to remove surrounding unstable cartilage. A microfracture awl of 1 mm or less is used to puncture the subchondral bone with 3-4 mm of spacing between to induce punctate bleeding. Initial (<5 year) results are good to excellent in 80% of cases, with some deterioration of improvement over time. Factors contributing to poor results include surface area greater than 1.5 cm2, overall osteochondral lesion depth over 7.8 mm, smoking history, age over 40, and uncontained lesions. Lesions greater than 1.29 cm2, cystic lesions, and lesions that have failed prior treatment are potential candidates for osteochondral autograft transplantation. The autograft is typically harvested from the lateral femoral condyle of the ipsilateral knee with an optimal plug depth and diameter of 12-15 mm. Transplantation often involves open technique and may even require malleolar osteotomy for perpendicular access to the defect, as well as visualization of a flush, congruent graft fit. Good to excellent outcomes have been reported in up 87.4% of cases with the most common complication being donor site morbidity in up to 15% of cases. Failure rates increased significantly in lesions larger than 225 mm2. Scaffold-based therapies, such as matrix-associated chondrocyte implantation, can be employed in primary or revision settings in lesions larger than 1 cm2, including uncontained shoulder lesions with or without cysts. Lesions with greater than 4 mm of bone loss following debridement may require bone grafting to augment with the scaffold. This technique requires an initial procedure for chondrocyte harvest and a secondary procedure for transplantation of the scaffold. Outcomes have been good to excellent in up to 93% of cases; however, this technique requires a two-stage procedure and can be cost-prohibitive. Particulated juvenile cartilage is a restorative technique that employs cartilage allograft from juvenile donors. The cartilage is placed into the defect and secured with fibrin glue in a single-stage procedure. Studies have shown favorable outcomes in 92% of cases, with lesions between 10 and 15 mm in diameter, but increased failure rates and poorer outcomes in lesions larger than 15 mm. This may be an alternative option for contained lesions between 10 and 15 mm in diameter. Osteochondral allograft plugs are an option for larger contained lesions (>1.5 cm in diameter) and in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and concern for donor site morbidity. Furthermore, bulk osteochondral allograft from a size-matched talus can also be used for even larger, unstable/uncontained shoulder lesions. An anterior approach is often employed and fixation is achieved via placement of countersunk headless compression screws. Failure of the aforementioned options associated with persistent pain or progressive OA would then lend consideration to ankle arthroplasty versus ankle arthrodesis.",0

Although allografts and autografts will restore function in most adults, it is unclear whether fresh osteochondral allograft transplantations similarly restore function in skeletally immature patients who failed conventional treatment.Therefore, we determined function in (1) daily activity; (2) sports participation; and (3) healing (by imaging) in children with juvenile OCD who failed conventional therapy and underwent fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation.We retrospectively reviewed 11 children with OCD of the knee treated with a fresh stored osteochondral allograft between 2004 and 2009 (six males and five females). The average age of the children at the time of their allograft surgery was 15.2 years (range, 13-20 years). The clinical assessments included physical examination, radiography, MRI, and a modified Merle D'Aubigné-Postel score. The size of the allograft was an average of 5.11 cm(2). The minimum followup was 12 months (average, 24 months; range, 12-41 months).All patients had returned to activities of daily living without difficulties at 6 months and returned to full sports activities between 9 and 12 months after surgery. The modified Merle D'Aubigné-Postel score improved from an average of 12.7 preoperatively to 16.3 at 24 months postoperatively. Followup radiographs at 2 years showed full graft incorporation and no demarcation between the host and graft bone.Our observations suggested fresh osteochondral allografts restored short-term function in patients with juvenile OCD who failed standard treatments.Level IV, case series.

The inability of cartilage tissue to self-repair is instrumental in developing tissue engineered substitutes. To this effect, the present study aims to engineer cartilage construct by culturing umbilical cord blood-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on novel 3D porous scaffolds developed from natural biopolymers, silk fibroin (SF) and chitosan (CS), with addition of cartilage matrix components, glucosamine (Gl) and chondroitin sulfate (Ch). The presence of Gl and Ch is expected to enhance cartilage regeneration. The developed SF/CS-Gl-Ch scaffolds possess desired pore size in the range 56.55-168.15 μm, 88-92% porosity, 44.7-46.8̊ contact angle, controlled swelling and biodegradability. Upon culturing under dynamic condition in a spinner flask bioreactor, the scaffold supported hMSCs attachment, proliferation, and further promoted chondrogenic differentiation. Cartilage-specific matrix and gene (Collagen II, Sox9 and aggrecan) expression analyses by histology, immunophenotype, immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR studies showed superiority of cell-scaffold construct generated in dynamic culture towards cartilage tissue generation as compared to cell aggregates formed by pellet culture. This study demonstrates the potentiality of SF/CS-Gl-Ch porous scaffold for the development of tissue construct for cartilage regeneration under dynamic culture condition.",0

Advanced biomaterials and tissue engineered constructs have been developed to improve cartilage repair; nevertheless, their clinical translation has been hampered by the lack of reliable in vitro models suitable for pre-clinical screening of new implants and compounds. In this study, an osteochondral defect model in a bioreactor that mimics the multi-axial motion of an articulating joint, was developed. Osteochondral explants were obtained from bovine stifle joints, and cartilage defects of 4 mm diameter were created. The explants were used as an interface against a ceramic ball applying dynamic compressive and shear loading. Osteochondral defects were filled with chondrocytes-seeded fibrin-polyurethane constructs and subjected to mechanical stimulation. Cartilage viability, proteoglycan accumulation and gene expression of seeded chondrocytes were compared to free swelling controls. Cells within both cartilage and bone remained viable throughout the 10-day culture period. Loading did not wear the cartilage, as indicated by histological evaluation and glycosaminoglycan release. The gene expression of seeded chondrocytes indicated a chondrogenic response to the mechanical stimulation. Proteoglycan 4 and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein were markedly increased, while mRNA ratios of collagen type II to type I and aggrecan to versican were also enhanced. This mechanically stimulated osteochondral defect culture model provides a viable microenvironment and will be a useful pre-clinical tool to screen new biomaterials and biological regenerative therapies under relevant complex mechanical stimuli. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Articular cartilage lesions have a poor healing capacity and reflect one of the most challenging problems in orthopedic clinical practice. The aim of current research is to develop a testing system to assess biomaterials for implants, that can permanently replace damaged cartilage with the original hyaline structure and can withstand the mechanical forces long term. Here, we present an osteochondral ex vivo culture model within a cartilage bioreactor, which mimics the complex motion of an articulating joint in vivo. The implementation of mechanical forces is essential for pre-clinical testing of novel technologies in the field of cartilage repair, biomaterial engineering and regenerative medicine. Our model provides a unique opportunity to investigate healing of articular cartilage defects in a physiological joint-like environment.",0

Although there have been many attempts to treat articular cartilage defects, such as drilling, microfracture techniques, soft tissue grafts or osteochondral grafts, no treatment has managed to repair the defects with long-lasting hyaline cartilage. Recently, a regenerative medicine using a tissue engineering technique for cartilage repair has been given much attention in the orthopedic field. In 1994, Brittberg et al. introduced a new cell technology in which chondrocytes expanded in monolayer culture were transplanted into the cartilage defect of the knee. As a second generation of chondrocyte transplantation, since 1996 we have been performing transplantation of tissue-engineered cartilage made ex vivo for the treatment of osteochondral defects of the joints. This signifies a concept shift from cell transplantation to tissue transplantation made ex vivo using tissue engineering techniques. We have reported good clinical results with this surgical treatment. However, extensive basic research is vital to achieve better clinical results with this tissue engineering technique. This article describes our recent research using a minimally invasive tissue engineering technique to promote cartilage regeneration.",0

In the knee joint of miniature pigs, cartilage lesions were treated by microfracturing and were then either left empty, covered with a collagen membrane, or treated by matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation. In control lesions, the subchondral bone plate was left intact (partial-thickness lesion). The repair tissues were analyzed after 12 weeks by histological methods focusing on bone formation and vascularization. The effect of chondrocytes on angiogenesis was assessed by in vitro assays. The presence of antiangiogenic proteins in cartilage repair tissue, including thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and chondromodulin-I (ChM-I), was detected immunohistochemically and their expression in chondrocytes and bone marrow stromal cells was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Significant outgrowths of subchondral bone and excessive endochondral ossification within the repair tissue were regularly observed in lesions with an exposed or microfractured subchondral bone plate. In contrast, such excessive bone formation was significantly inhibited by the additional transplantation of chondrocytes. Cartilaginous repair tissue that resisted ossification was strongly positive for the antiangiogenic proteins, TSP-1 and ChM-I, which were, however, not detectable in vascularized osseous outgrowths. Chondrocytes were identified to be the major source of TSP-1- and ChM-I expression and were shown to counteract the angiogenic activity of endothelial cells. These data suggest that the resistance of cartilaginous repair tissue against endochondral ossification following the transplantation of chondrocytes is associated with the presence of antiangiogenic proteins whose individual relevance has yet to be further explored.",0

Graphene oxide with 0.3, 0.5, and 1 wt% was added to different concentrations of PCL solutions under sonication. The blends were electrospun under varied conditions of 10-20 kV applied voltages, a distance of 10 to 20 cm, and a 0.5 ml/hr flow rate. The web of PCL(10 %)-GO(0.5 %) was selected as an optimum one via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, which exhibited uniform morphology with a 257 +/- 18 nm average diameter. The fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results showed that the specified peaks of both PCL and GO in the blends. Mechanical investigation exhibited higher strength of the PCL-GO web (about 4.3 MPa) compare to the PCL web. The porosity of the webs was measured by densitometry, which showed an increase in porosity from 80 % to 92 % after the bulking process (ultra-sonication, followed by freeze-drying). The MTT assay was employed using human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) on the scaffolds. Results indicated that the cell viability of bulk and non-bulk PCL-GO scaffolds were about 98 % and 99.8 %, respectively. In vivo study was carried out on defected cartilage knees of fourteen New Zealand rabbits. For monitoring the cartilage repair, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as pathological investigations were performed after surgery. The results of MRI and H&E staining showed high qualified healing of defects, which were exposed to bulk nanofibrous scaffold. Therefore, bulk PCL-GO electrospun scaffolds can be introduced as a suitable scaffolds for cartilage regeneration.",0

Interest has recently focused on fresh osteochondral allografts as a promising treatment alternative. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of osteochondral lesions of the talus treated with a fresh osteochondral allograft.We performed a transfer of fresh osteochondral allograft in forty-two patients with a symptomatic, refractory osteochondral lesion of the talus. Complete postoperative follow-up was achieved for thirty-eight patients with an average age of 44.2 years. Clinical evaluation was performed with use of the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score and a visual analog pain scale. All scores were obtained from either a retrospective chart review or a direct patient interview. All patients were also asked about their subjective satisfaction with the procedure. Magnetic resonance images were acquired for fifteen patients, to assess graft incorporation, subsidence, articular cartilage congruity, osteoarthritis, and stability with use of the De Smet criteria.The average duration of follow-up after osteochondral allograft transplantation was 37.7 months. Graft failure occurred in four patients. With the inclusion of scores before revision for those with graft failure, the mean visual analog pain scale score improved from 8.2 to 3.3 points, and the mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score improved from 52 to 79 points. Patient satisfaction with the outcome was rated as excellent, very good, or good by twenty-eight of the thirty-eight patients and as fair or poor by ten patients. Of the fifteen magnetic resonance imaging scans, most showed minimal graft subsidence, reasonable graft stability, and persistent articular congruence.In our experience, transplantation of fresh osteochondral allograft is a viable and effective method for the treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus as evidenced by improvements in pain and function.",0

After 4 months, the time necessary for the development of cartilage surface damage, animals were treated either with trephination bone plug wrapped with the chondroprogenic hBM-MSCs-embedded collagen scaffold or microfractures alone. Histological and histomorphometric evaluations were performed at 5 months after surgery.All animals subjected to ACL transection showed osteoarthritic changes including mild lateral femoral condyle or moderate medial femoral condyle ulcerations. After 14 days' chondrogenic induction, hBM-MSCs seeded onto the scaffold showed expression of chondroprogenitor markers such as SOX9 and COMP. At 5 months after the implantation, significant differences in the quality of the regenerated tissue were found between the hBM-MSCs-embedded scaffold group and the control group. Newly generated tissue was only observed at the site of implantation with the hBM-MSCs-embedded scaffolds. Furthermore, histological examination of the generated tissue revealed evidence of cartilage-like tissue with lacuna formation. In contrast, fibrous layers or fissures were formed on the surface of the control knee joint.This study shows that xenogenic hBM-MSC derived chondroprogenitor scaffolds can generate new cartilage tissue in porcine articular cartilage and have the potential as a useful treatment option for osteoarthritis.",0

Many approaches attempt to increase the number of matrix-producing cells that can migrate to the interface, which may help to reinforce the boundary over time but does not address the problems associated with an initially unstable interface. The objective of this study was to develop a bioadhesive implant to create an immediate bond with the extracellular matrix components of articular cartilage. We hypothesized that implant-bound collagen adhesion protein (CNA) would increase the interfacial strength between a poly(vinly alcohol) implant and an articular cartilage immediately after implantation, without preventing cell migration into the implant. By way of a series of in vitro immunohistochemical and mechanical experiments, we demonstrated that (i) free CNA can bind to articular cartilage, (ii) implant-bound CNA can bind to collagen type II and (iii) implants functionalized with CNA result in a fourfold increase in interfacial strength with cartilage relative to untreated implants at day zero. Of note, the interfacial strength significantly decreased after 21 days in culture, which may be an indication that the protein itself has lost its effectiveness. Our data suggest that functionalizing scaffolds with CNA may be a viable approach toward creating an initially stable interface between scaffolds and articular cartilage. Further efforts are required to ensure long-term interface stability.",0

Current treatment options such as abrasion arthroplasty procedures, osteochondral transplantation and autologous chondrocyte implantation fail to produce repair tissue exhibiting the same mechanical and functional properties of native articular cartilage. This results in repair tissue that inevitably fails as it is unable to deal with the mechanical demands of articular cartilage, and does not prevent further degeneration of the native cartilage. Mesenchymal stem cells have been proposed as a potential source of cells for cell-based cartilage repair due to their ability to self-renew and undergo multi-lineage differentiation. This proposed procedure has the advantage of not requiring harvesting of cells from the joint surface, and its associated donor site morbidity, as well as having multiple possible adult donor tissues such as bone marrow, adipose tissue and synovium. Mesenchymal stem cells have multi-lineage potential, but can be stimulated to undergo chondrogenesis in the appropriate culture medium. As the majority of work with mesenchymal stem cell-derived articular cartilage repair has been carried out in vitro and in animal studies, more work still has to be done before this technique can be used for clinical purposes. This includes realizing the ideal method of harvesting mesenchymal stem cells, the culture medium to stimulate proliferation and differentiation, appropriate choice of scaffold incorporating growth factors directly or with gene therapy and integration of repair tissue with native tissue.",0

Without access to progenitor cells and the supply of blood and nutrients, the impaired articular cartilage would be short of the capability to self-repair. Although the present clinical treatments, including autogenous and allograft osteochondral transplantation, microfracture technique, and so forth, have shown some efficacies, their drawbacks, such as donor insufficiency and poor-integration with adjacent tissue, limit the satisfactory repair of articular cartilage defects and cause unsatisfied prognosis. Cartilage tissue engineering, involving the combination of progenitor cells with scaffolds, which serve as artificial extracellular matrices (ECMs), provides a promising strategy for cartilage regeneration. Recently, thermosensitive hydrogels have attracted much attention as scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering owing to their unique physical properties analogous to the native ECM. In this review, we summarize the fabrication, characterization of newly reported thermosensitive hydrogels as cartilage tissue engineering scaffolds. The potential challenges and future perspectives are proposed.",0

Nevertheless, many studies have been focusing on autologous MSCs. The following study investigates the safety and effectiveness of intraarticular injection of allogenic MSCs in a pig OA model.Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles were labelled with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) to allow cells tracking using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A pig OA model was established by bilateral medial meniscectomy. Next, SPIO-BM-MSCs were injected into the right knee, while the left knee was left untreated. MRI and radiography were used to assess the degree of OA and to evaluate the effectiveness of allogenic MSCs. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), safranin-o fast green staining, toluidine blue, and immunohistochemical staining were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the injections.At concentration of ≤20 µg/mL, SPIO caused no toxicity to BM-MSCs. Four weeks after surgery, OA changes were observed on MRI scan. The SPIO labeled BM-MSCs were found moving towards the impaired part of the cartilage 8 to 24 h after injections. In addition, no significant differences between the right side (therapeutic side) and the left side (untreated side) were observed following histological and immunohistochemistry analysis.The suitable concentration of SPIO for labelling BMSCs was 20 µg/mL, while the allogenic MSCs could move towards and accumulate around the impaired cartilage. No significant difference was found between treatment and control group.",0

The avascular nature of cartilage and the altered chondrocyte phenotype characteristic of OA severely limit the capacity for in vivo tissue regeneration. Cell- and tissue-based repair has the potential to revolutionize treatment of OA, but those approaches have exhibited limited clinical success to date. In this study, we test the hypothesis that bovine and human chondrocytes in a collagen type I scaffold will form hyaline cartilage ex vivo with immunohistochemical, biochemical, and magnetic resonance (MR) endpoints similar to the original native cartilage. Chondrocytes were isolated from 1- to 3-week-old calf knee cartilage or from cartilage obtained from human total knee arthroplasties, suspended in 2.7 mg/mL collagen I, and plated as 300 microL spot cultures with 5 x 10(6) each. Medium formulations were varied, including the amount of serum, the presence or absence of ascorbate, and treatments with cytokines. Bovine chondrocytes generated metachromatic territorial and interstitial matrix and accumulated type II collagen over time. Type VI collagen was confined primarily to the pericellular region. The ex vivo-formed bovine cartilage contained more chondroitin sulfate per dry weight than native cartilage. Human chondrocytes remained viable and generated metachromatic territorial matrix, but were unable to support interstitial matrix accumulation. MR analysis of ex vivo-formed bovine cartilage revealed evidence of progressively maturing matrix, but MR-derived indices of tissue quality did not reach those of native cartilage. We conclude that the collagen-spot culture model supports formation and maturation of three-dimensional hyaline cartilage from active bovine chondrocytes. Future studies will focus on determining the capacity of human chondrocytes to show comparable tissue formation.",0

961,https://openalex.org/W3023312352,,Arthroscopic lavage and debridement for osteoarthritis of the knee: an evidence-based analysis.,"The purpose of this review was to determine the effectiveness and adverse effects of arthroscopic lavage and debridement, with or without lavage, in the treatment of symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, and to conduct an economic analysis if evidence for effectiveness can be established. QUESTIONS ASKED: Does arthroscopic lavage improve motor function and pain associated with OA of the knee?Does arthroscopic debridement improve motor function and pain associated with OA of the knee?If evidence for effectiveness can be established, what is the duration of effect?What are the adverse effects of these procedures?What are the economic considerations if evidence for effectiveness can be established?Osteoarthritis, the most common rheumatologic musculoskeletal disorder, affects about 10% of the Canadian adult population. Although the natural history of OA is not known, it is a degenerative condition that affects the bone cartilage in the joint. It can be diagnosed at earlier ages, particularly within the sports injuries population, though the prevalence of non-injury-related OA increases with increasing age and varies with gender, with women being twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with this condition. Thus, with an aging population, the impact of OA on the health care system is expected to be considerable. Treatments for OA of the knee include conservative or nonpharmacological therapy, like physiotherapy, weight management and exercise; and more generally, intra-articular injections, arthroscopic surgery and knee replacement surgery. Whereas knee replacement surgery is considered an end-of-line intervention, the less invasive surgical procedures of lavage or debridement may be recommended for earlier and more severe disease. Both arthroscopic lavage and debridement are generally indicated in patients with knee joint pain, with or without mechanical problems, that are refractory to medical therapy. The clinical utility of these procedures is unclear, hence, the assessment of their effectiveness in this review. LAVAGE AND DEBRIDEMENT: Arthroscopic lavage involves the visually guided introduction of saline solution into the knee joint and removal of fluid, with the intent of extracting any excess fluids and loose bodies that may be in the knee joint. Debridement, in comparison, may include the introduction of saline into the joint, in addition to the smoothening of bone surface without any further intervention (less invasive forms of debridement), or the addition of more invasive procedures such as abrasion, partial or full meniscectomy, synovectomy, or osteotomy (referred to as debridement in combination with meniscectomy or other procedures). The focus of this health technology assessment is on the effectiveness of lavage, and debridement (with or without meniscal tear resection).THE MEDICAL ADVISORY SECRETARIAT FOLLOWED ITS STANDARD PROCEDURES AND SEARCHED THESE ELECTRONIC DATABASES: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and The International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment. THE KEYWORDS SEARCHED WERE: arthroscopy, debridement, lavage, wound irrigation, or curettage; arthritis, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis; osteoarthritis, knee; knee or knee joint. TIME FRAME: Only 2 previous health technology assessments were identified, one of which was an update of the other, and included 3 of 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the first report. Therefore, the search period for inclusion of studies in this assessment was January 1, 1995 to April 24, 2005. EXCLUDED WERE: case reports, comments, editorials, and letters. Identified were 335 references, including previously published health technology assessments, and 5 articles located through a manual search of references from published articles and health technology assessments. These were examined against the criteria, as described below, which resulted in the inclusion of 1 health technology assessment and its corresponding update, and 4 articles (2 RCTs and 2 level 4 studies) for arthroscopic lavage and 8 papers (2 RCTs and 6 level 4 studies) for arthroscopic debridement.English-language articles from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Systematic Reviews, and health technology assessments from January 1, 1995 onwardStudies on OA of the knee with a focus on the outcomes of motor function and painStudies of arthroscopic procedures onlyStudies in which meniscal tear resection/meniscectomy (partial or full) has been conducted in conjunction with lavage or debridement.Studies that focus on inflammatory OA, joint tuberculosis, septic joints, psoriatic joints (e.g., psoriatic knee joint synovitis), synovitis, chondropathy of the knee and gonarthrosis (which includes varotic gonarthrosis)Studies that focus on rheumatoid arthritisStudies that focus on meniscal tears from an acute injury (e.g., sports injury)Studies that are based on lavage or debridement for microfracture of the kneeStudies in which other surgical procedures (e.g., high tibial osteotomy, synovectomy, have been conducted in addition to lavage/debridement)Studies based on malalignment of the knee (e.g., varus/valgus arthritic conditions).Studies that compare lavage to lavage plus drug therapyStudies on procedures that are not arthroscopic (i.e., visually guided) (e.g., nonarthroscopic lavage)Studies of OA in children.Arthroscopic lavage or debridement, with or without meniscectomy, for the treatment of motor function symptoms and pain associated with OA of the knee.Studies in which there was a comparison group of either diseased or healthy subjects or one in which subjects were their own control were included. Comparisons to other treatments included placebo (or sham) arthroscopy. Sham arthroscopy involved making small incisions and manipulating the knee, without the insertion of instruments.IN EARLY OA OF THE KNEE WITH PAIN REFRACTORY TO MEDICAL TREATMENT, THERE IS LEVEL 1B EVIDENCE THAT: Arthroscopic lavage gives rise to a statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful effect in improving pain (WOMAC pain and VAS pain) up to 12 months following surgery. The effect on joint function (WOMAC function) and the primary outcome (WOMAC aggregate) was neither statistically nor clinically significant. IN MODERATE OR SEVERE OA OF THE KNEE WITH PAIN REFRACTORY TO MEDICAL TREATMENT, THERE IS: Level 1b evidence that the effect on pain and function of arthroscopic lavage (10 L saline) and debridement (with 10 L saline lavage) is not statistically significant up to 24 months following surgery.Level 2 evidence that arthroscopic debridement (with 3 L saline lavage) is effective in the control of pain in severe OA of the medial femoral condyle for up to 5 years.For debridement in combination with meniscectomy, there is level 4 evidence that the procedure, as appropriate, might be effective in earlier stages, unicompartmental disease, shorter symptom duration, sudden onset of mechanical symptoms, and preoperative full range of motion. However, as these findings are derived from very poor quality evidence, the identification of subsets of patients that may benefit from this procedure requires further testing.In patients with pain due to a meniscal tear, of the medial compartment in particular, repair of the meniscus results in better pain control at 2 years following surgery than if the pain is attributable to other causes. There is insufficient evidence to comment on the effectiveness of lateral meniscus repair on pain control.Arthroscopic debridement of the knee has thus far only been found to be effective for medial compartmental OA. All other indications should be reviewed with a view to reducing arthroscopic debridement as an effective therapy. Arthroscopic lavage of the knee is not indicated for any stage of OA. There is very poor quality evidence on the effectiveness of debridement with partial meniscectomy in the case of meniscal tears in OA of the knee.",0

The increasing number of patients suffering from joint-related conditions leads to a concomitant increase in the economic burden. In this review article, we focus on strategies to repair and replace knee joint cartilage, since knee-associated disabilities are more prevalent than any other joint. Because of inadequacies associated with widely used approaches, the orthopedic community has an increasing tendency to develop biological strategies, which include transplantation of autologous (i.e., mosaicplasty) or allogeneic osteochondral grafts, autologous chondrocytes (autologous chondrocyte transplantation), or tissue-engineered cartilage substitutes. Tissue-engineered cartilage constructs represent a highly promising treatment option for knee injury as they mimic the biomechanical environment of the native cartilage and have superior integration capabilities. Currently, a wide range of tissue-engineering-based strategies are established and investigated clinically as an alternative to the routinely used techniques (i.e., knee replacement and autologous chondrocyte transplantation). Tissue-engineering-based strategies include implantation of autologous chondrocytes in combination with collagen I, collagen I/III (matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation), HYAFF 11 (Hyalograft C), and fibrin glue (Tissucol) or implantation of minced cartilage in combination with copolymers of polyglycolic acid along with polycaprolactone (cartilage autograft implantation system), and fibrin glue (DeNovo NT graft). Tissue-engineered cartilage replacements show better clinical outcomes in the short term, and with advances that have been made in orthopedics they can be introduced arthroscopically in a minimally invasive fashion. Thus, the future is bright for this innovative approach to restore function.",0

Chondral defects may arise from a variety of joint pathologies and left untreated, will likely progress to osteoarthritis. Current repair techniques, such as microfracture, result in short-term clinical improvements but have poor long-term outcomes. Emerging scaffold-based repair strategies have reported superior outcomes compared to microfracture and motivate the development of new biomaterials for this purpose. In this study, unique composite implants consisting of a base porous reinforcing component (woven poly(ε-caprolactone)) infiltrated with 1 of 2 hydrogels (self-assembling peptide or thermo-gelling hyaluronan) or bone marrow aspirate were evaluated. The objective was to evaluate cartilage repair with composite scaffold treatment compared to the current standard of care (microfracture) in a translationally relevant large animal model, the Yucatan minipig. While many cartilage-repair studies have shown some success in vivo, most are short term and not clinically relevant. Informed by promising 6-week findings, a 12-month study was carried out and those results are presented here. To aid in comparisons across platforms, several structural and functionally relevant outcome measures were performed. Despite positive early findings, the long-term results indicated less than optimal structural and mechanical results with respect to cartilage repair, with all treatment groups performing worse than the standard of care. This study is important in that it brings much needed attention to the importance of performing translationally relevant long-term studies in an appropriate animal model when developing new clinical cartilage repair approaches.",0

However, a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical outcomes of those treatment modalities in OLT has yet to be published. The purpose of this review is to provide an evidence-based overview of clinical outcomes following biologic augmentation to surgical treatments for OLT. Design A comprehensive literature review was performed. Two commonly used surgical techniques for the treatment of OLT—bone marrow stimulation and osteochondral autograft transfer—are first introduced. The review describes the operative indications, step-by- step operative procedure, clinical outcomes, and concerns associated with each treatment. A review of the currently published basic science and clinical evidence on biologic augmentation in the surgical treatments for OLT, including platelet-rich plasma, concentrated bone marrow aspirate, and scaffold-based therapy follows. Results Biologic agents and scaffold-based therapies appear to be promising agents, capable of improving both clinical and radiological outcomes in OLT. Nevertheless, variable production methods of these biologic augmentations confound the interpretation of clinical outcomes of cases treated with these agents. Conclusions Current clinical evidence supports the use of biologic agents in OLT cases. Nonetheless, well-designed clinical trials with patient-specific, validated and objective outcome measurements are warranted to develop standardized clinical guidelines for the use of biologic augmentation for the treatment of OLT in clinical practice.",0

One of the main problems of this surgical strategy is related to the harvesting of the cartilage slice from a healthy knee. The aim of this study was to examine the capacity of chondrocytes harvested from a detached osteochondral fragment to proliferate and to serve as a source of viable cells for ACI in the repair of ankle cartilage defects.Detached osteochondral fragments harvested from the ankle joint of 20 patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus served as the source of human articular cartilage specimens. All of the osteochondral lesions were chronic and of traumatic origin. In all cases, the fragments were utilized to evaluate the viability and proliferation of the cells, the histological appearance of the cartilage tissue and the expression of specific cartilage markers by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the 16 patients scheduled for ACI, the expanded chondrocytes were used for chondrocyte implantation. In the other 4 patients, with lesion size <1.5cm(2), microfractures were created during the initial arthroscopic step. As a control group, 7 patients with comparable osteochondral lesions underwent the same surgery, but received chondrocytes harvested from the ipsilateral knee.According to the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Scoring (AOFAS) system, patients in the experimental group had a preoperative score of 54.2+/-16 points and a postoperative one of 89+/-9.6 points after a minimum follow-up time of 12 months (P<0.0005). The control group of patients had a preoperative score of 54.6+/-11.7 points and a postoperative one of 90.2+/-9.7 points at a minimum follow-up time of 12 months (P<0.0005). The clinical results of the two groups did not differ significantly from each other. Chondrocytes isolated from the detached fragments were highly viable, phenotypically stable, proliferated in culture and redifferentiated when grown within the three-dimensional scaffold used for ACI. The morphological and molecular characteristics of the cartilage samples obtained from the detached osteochondral fragments were similar to those of healthy hyaline articular cartilage.The good results achieved with this strategy indicate that cells derived from the lesioned area may be useful in the treatment of osteochondral defects of the talus.",0

Here, we report the development of a novel tricalcium phosphate-collagen-hyaluronate (TCP-COL-HA) scaffold that can function as a stem cell carrier to induce chondrogenesis and promote cartilage repair, and the investigation of chondroinductive properties of scaffolds containing varying amounts of TCP, COL and HA. TCP-COL-HA scaffolds, as well as TCP-COL scaffolds at two different TCP/COL ratios (50:50 and 25:75), were evaluated for their ability to induce cartilage regeneration from rabbit mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) in vitro and in vivo. Chondrogenic differentiation was evaluated by sulphated glycosaminoglycan quantification, collagen type II immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR. Mechanical strength was evaluated by the compression test. The results showed that the TCP-COL-HA scaffolds enhanced rMSC chondrogenesis to a greater degree than did the TCP-COL scaffolds; for the latter, the scaffold with the lower TCP/COL ratio (25:75) was superior in terms of promoting rMSC chondrogenesis. Similar results were obtained in an ectopic implantation model in nude mice. In a critical-size rabbit osteochondral defect-repair model, rMSCs seeded on TCP-COL-HA scaffolds showed greater cartilage regeneration and integration into surrounding tissue than the TCP-COL groups, in which cartilage repair was more efficient at the 25:75 than at the 50:50 ratio. These results indicate that the addition of HA and different TCP/COL ratios can affect the chondroinductive capacity of scaffolds, and suggest that the TCP-COL-HA scaffold can serve as an effective cell carrier for cartilage regeneration.",0

A total of 24 bi-layer (5 mm, four in each condyle) or three-layer C-HA scaffolds (8 mm, eight in the trochlea, four in each condyle) were first press-fit implanted and underwent testing with CPM, 90 cycles, 0°-90°. The second set of 24 scaffolds was implanted in cleaned lesions with the addition of fibrin glue. Two knees with fibrin glue fixation were additionally exposed to 15 kg loading, with 30 cycles of CPM, 0°-30°. Then, the knees were reopened and the scaffolds were evaluated using semi-quantitative Drobnic and modified Bekkers scores.All but two scaffolds remained in the lesions site throughout CPM. Two implants failed: both were bi-layer osteochondral scaffolds, press-fit implanted at the lateral femoral condyle (LFC). A statistically significant difference was obtained between press-fit and fibrin glue implants with both Drobnic (2.9 ± 0.7 vs 4.3 ± 0.1, P < 0.0005) and Bekkers (3.3 ± 1.0 vs 5.0 ± 0.1, P < 0.0005) scores. Additional knee loading did not affect fibrin glue scaffold fixation or integrity.This cadaveric study showed fibrin glue notably improved bi-layer or three-layer C-HA scaffold press-fit fixation regardless of lesion location. It is therefore recommended that fibrin glue be used during surgery to improve early post-operative C-HA scaffold stability and integrity.",0

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether incorporation of the power of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) sheet to MSCs-loaded bilayer poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolds can improve the integration and repair of cartilage defects in a rabbit model. Rabbit bone marrow-derived MSCs were cultured and formed cell sheet. Full-thickness cylindrical osteochondral defects (4 mm in diameter, 3 mm in depth) were created in the patellar groove of 18 New Zealand white rabbits and the osteochondral defects were treated with PLGA scaffold (n = 6), PLGA/MSCs (n = 6) or MSC sheet-encapsulated PLGA/MSCs (n = 6). After 6 and 12 weeks, the integration and tissue response were evaluated histologically. The MSC sheet-encapsulated PLGA/MCSs group showed significantly more amounts of hyaline cartilage and higher histological scores than PLGA/MSCs group and PLGA group (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). In addition, the MSC sheet-encapsulated PLGA/MCSs group showed the best integration between the repaired cartilage and surrounding normal cartilage and subchondral bone compared to other two groups. The novel method of incorporation of MSC sheet to PLGA/MCSs could enhance the ability of cartilage regeneration and integration between repair cartilage and the surrounding cartilage.

Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strive to develop new solutions to regenerate hyaline cartilage tissue. This systematic review and meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview of current literature and assesses the efficacy of articular cartilage regeneration by implantation of cell-laden versus cell-free biomaterials in the knee and ankle joint in animals after bone marrow stimulation. PubMed and EMBASE (via OvidSP) were systematically searched using tissue engineering, cartilage and animals search strategies. Included were primary studies in which cellular and acellular biomaterials were implanted after applying bone marrow stimulation in the knee or ankle joint in healthy animals. Study characteristics were tabulated and outcome data were collected for meta-analysis for studies applying semi-quantitative histology as outcome measure (117 studies). Cartilage regeneration was expressed on an absolute 0–100% scale and random effects meta-analyses were performed. Implantation of cellular biomaterials significantly improved cartilage regeneration by 18.6% compared to acellular biomaterials. No significant differences were found between biomaterials loaded with stem cells and those loaded with somatic cells. Culture conditions of cells did not affect cartilage regeneration. Cartilage formation was reduced with adipose-derived stem cells compared to other cell types, but still improved compared to acellular scaffolds. Assessment of the risk of bias was impaired due to incomplete reporting for most studies. Implantation of cellular biomaterials improves cartilage regeneration compared to acellular biomaterials.",0

Chart review, patient questionnaires, and validated knee function assessment tools were used: International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form scores ranged from 0 (maximal disability) to 100 (no disability). Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index scores ranged from 0% (no disability) to 100% (maximal disability). Magnetic resonance imaging and radiographs were obtained on the donor knee on the majority of patients.Questionnaire response rate was 79% (45 of 57 patients). Average patient age was 35 ± 11 years (range, 19-70 years). Average postoperative follow-up was 27 ± 17 months (range, 9-108 months).

Healthy and diseased engineered cartilage from human chondrocytes (cultured in agar gels) were integrated with human bone marrow stem cell (HBMSC)-derived cartilaginous engineered matrix with and without HA, and evaluated after 28 days of growth. HBMSCs were seeded within photopolymerizable poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels. In addition, we also conducted a preliminary in vivo evaluation of cartilage repair in rabbit knee chondral defects treated with subchondral bone microfracture and cell-free PEGDA with and without HA. Under in vitro conditions, the interfacial shear strength between tissue engineered cartilage derived from HBMSCs and osteoarthritic chondrocytes was significantly higher (p < 0.05) when HA nanoparticles were incorporated within the HBMSC culture system. Histological evidence confirmed a distinct spatial transition zone, rich in calcium phosphate deposits. Assessment of explanted rabbit knees by histology demonstrated that cellularity within the repair tissues that had filled the defects were of significantly higher number (p < 0.05) when HA was used. HA nanoparticles play an important role in treating chondral defects when osteoarthritis is a co-morbidity. We speculate that the calcified layer formation at the interface in the osteoarthritic environment in the presence of HA is likely to have attributed to higher interfacial strength found in vitro. From an in vivo standpoint, the presence of HA promoted cellularity in the tissues that subsequently filled the chondral defects. This higher presence of cells can be considered important in the context of accelerating long-term cartilage remodeling. We conclude that HA nanoparticles play an important role in engineered to native cartilage integration and cellular processes.",0

Systematic Review of Literature,"Treatment of osteochondral defects remains a challenge in orthopedic surgery. The TruFit plug has been investigated as a potential treatment method for osteochondral defects. This is a biphasic scaffold designed to stimulate cartilage and subchondral bone formation. The aim of this study is to investigate clinical, radiological, and histological efficacy of the TruFit plug in restoring osteochondral defects in the joint.We performed a systematic search in five databases for clinical trials in which patients were treated with a TruFit plug for osteochondral defects. Studies had to report clinical, radiological, or histological outcome data. Quality of the included studies was assessed.Five studies describe clinical results, all indicating improvement at follow-up of 12 months compared to preoperative status. However, two studies reporting longer follow-up show deterioration of early improvement. Radiological evaluation indicates favorable MRI findings regarding filling of the defect and incorporation with adjacent cartilage at 24 months follow-up, but conflicting evidence exists on the properties of the newly formed overlying cartilage surface. None of the included studies showed evidence for bone ingrowth. The few histological data available confirmed these results.There are no data available that support superiority or equality of TruFit compared to conservative treatment or mosaicplasty/microfracture. Further investigation is needed to improve synthetic biphasic implants as therapy for osteochondral lesions. Randomized controlled clinical trials comparing TruFit plugs with an established treatment method are needed before further clinical use can be supported.",0

Tissue engineered autologous cartilagenous tissue was cultured on calcium phosphate cylinders and implanted into osteochondral defects into the femoral condyles in minipigs. Radiological follow-up was performed at 2, 8, 26 and 52 weeks, condyles were harvested 26 and 52 weeks post-implantation. Thickness of cultivated tissue (1.10 +/- 0.55 mm) was comparable to in situ cartilage and cells produced in vitro cartilage specific proteins. In vivo, 26 and 52 weeks post-implantation defects were resurfaced with hyaline-like tissue, the implants were well integrated with no gap at the interface between the engineered neocartilage and the adjacent articular cartilage.

Aspiration from the iliac crest is the most widely used method to harvest bone marrow cells for cartilage repair. The objective of our study was to establish a new method to isolate mesenchymal progenitor cells by direct aspiration of bone marrow from the subchondral spongious bone underneath cartilage defects during microfracture treatment and to confirm the chondrogenic potential of the resulting cell cultures.Bone marrow was aspirated arthroscopically from patients treated for isolated cartilage defects. Adherent stromal cells were isolated, expanded in monolayer cultures, and characterized by flow cytometry. Chondrogenic induction of cells was achieved by combination of spheroid cultures in hanging drops and the concomitant use of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta). Articular chondrocytes established in three-dimensional (3D) cultures were used as positive cartilage-forming units, and skin fibroblasts were used as negative controls. Three-dimensional constructs were stained for immunohistochemical and histological examination, and a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to quantify the expression of aggrecan, collagen types 1 and 2, and Sox9.Mesenchymal stem cell-like progenitor cells (MSCs) displaying chondrogenic differentiation capacity were harvested arthroscopically from underneath cartilage lesions on distal femurs using the one-hole technique. Stem cell-related surface antigens analyzed by flow cytometry confirmed the nature of the isolated adherent cells. MSC spheroids stained positive for glycosaminoglycans and collagen type 2. Realtime PCR showed that MSCs in 3D spheroids significantly increased gene expression of collagen type 2, aggrecan, and Sox 9 and down-regulated expression of collagen type 1 when compared to the mRNA levels measured in MSCs monolayers.We describe a new technique that may be applied for harvesting bone marrow cells from cartilage defects during arthroscopic intervention of the knee. Cells harvested in this way hold full chondrogenic differentiation potential. Our data imply that MSC storage may be established by using marrow from this approach, bypassing the need for cell aspiration from the iliac crest.",0

A secondary objective was to identify salient demographic factors associated with these procedures.We performed a retrospective database review using a large private-payer medical record database within the PearlDiver database. The PearlDiver database is a publicly available, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant national database compiled from a collection of private insurer records. A search was performed for surgical techniques in cartilage palliation (chondroplasty), repair (microfracture/drilling), and restoration (arthroscopic osteochondral autograft, arthroscopic osteochondral allograft, autologous chondrocyte implantation, open osteochondral allograft, and open osteochondral autograft). The incidence, growth, and demographic factors associated with the surgical procedures were assessed.From 2004 through 2011, 198,876,000 patients were analyzed. A surgical procedure addressing a cartilage defect was performed in 1,959,007 patients, for a mean annual incidence of 90 surgeries per 10,000 patients. Across all cartilage procedures, there was a 5.0% annual incidence growth (palliative, 3.7%; repair, 0%; and restorative, 3.1%) (P = .027). Palliative techniques (chondroplasty) were more common (>2:1 ratio for repair [marrow-stimulation techniques] and 50:1 ratio for restoration [autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral autograft and allograft]).

However, adequate mechanical stability of these implants in the lesion is required for successful repair. Fibrin is the most common clinically available adhesive for cartilage implant fixation, but fixation quality using fibrin is not well understood. The objectives of this study were to investigate the conditions leading to damage in the fibrin adhesive and to determine which adhesive properties are important in preventing delamination at the interface. An idealized finite element model of the medial compartment of the knee was created, including a circular defect and an osteochondral implant. Damage and failure of fibrin at the interface was represented by a cohesive zone model with coefficients determined from an inverse finite element method and previously published experimental data. Our results demonstrated that fibrin glue alone may not be strong enough to withstand physiologic loads in vivo while fibrin glue combined with chondrocytes more effectively prevents damage at the interface. The results of this study suggest that fibrin fails mainly in shear during off-axis loading and that adhesive materials that are stronger or more compliant than fibrin may be good alternatives due to decreased failure at the interface. The present model may be used to improve design and testing protocols of bioadhesives and give insight into the failure mechanisms of cartilage implant fixation in the knee joint.",0

In this study, we investigated the characteristics and potential of human CSPCs combined with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolds to induce osteochondral regeneration in rabbit knees. We isolated CSPCs from human adult articular cartilage undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. We characterized CSPCs and compared them with infrapatellar fat pad-derived stem cells (IFPs) in a colony formation assay and by multilineage differentiation analysis in vitro. We further evaluated the osteochondral regeneration of the CSPC-loaded PLGA scaffold during osteochondral defect repair in rabbits. The characteristics of CSPCs were similar to those of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and exhibited chondrogenic and osteogenic phenotypes without chemical induction. For in vivo analysis, CSPC-loaded PLGA scaffolds produced a hyaline-like cartilaginous tissue, which showed good integration with the host tissue and subchondral bone. Furthermore, CSPCs migrated in response to injury to promote subchondral bone regeneration. Overall, we demonstrated that CSPCs can promote osteochondral regeneration. A monophasic approach of using diseased CSPCs combined with a PLGA scaffold may be beneficial for repairing complex tissues, such as osteochondral tissue.",0

In the knee, computer-assisted joint design can now be applied to the treatment of younger patients suffering pain and restriction of activity due to focal defects in their femoral articular cartilage. By taking MRI scans of the affected knee and digitally segmenting these scans, we can identify and map focal defects in cartilage and bone. Metallic implants matched to the defect can be fabricated, and guide instrumentation to ensure proper implant alignment and depth of recession in the surrounding cartilage can be designed from segmented MRI scans. Beginning in 2012, a series of 682 patient-specific implants were designed based on MRI analysis of femoral cartilage focal defects, and implanted in 612 knees. A Kaplan-Meier analysis found a cumulative survivorship of 96% at 7-year follow-up from the first implantation. Fourteen (2.3%) of these implants required revision due to disease progression, incorrect implant positioning, and inadequate lesion coverage at the time of surgery. These survivorship data compare favorably with all other modes of treatment for femoral focal cartilage lesions and support the use of patient-specific implants designed from segmented MRI scans in these cases.",0

To overcome this limitation, an expandable scaffold with a honeycomb-like structure has been developed using microfluidic technology. In this study, we evaluated the performance of this expandable gelatin scaffold seeded with rabbit chondrocytes in vivo. The chondrocyte/scaffold constructs were implanted into regions of surgically introduced cylindrical osteochondral defects in rabbit femoral condyles. At 2, 4, and 6 months postsurgery, the implanted constructs were evaluated by gross and histological examinations. As expected, the osteochondral defects, which were untreated or transplanted with blank scaffolds, showed no signs of repair, whereas the defects transplanted with chondrocyte/scaffold constructs showed significant cartilage regeneration. Furthermore, the expandable scaffolds seeded with chondrocytes had more regenerated cartilage tissue and better integration with the recipient tissue than autologous chondrocyte implantation. Biomechanical tests revealed that the chondrocyte/scaffold group had the highest compressive strength among all groups at all three time points and endured a similar compressive force to normal cartilage after 6 months of implantation. Histological examinations revealed that the chondrocytes were distributed uniformly within the scaffolds, maintained a normal phenotype, and secreted functional components of the extracellular matrix. Histomorphometric assessment showed a remarkable total interface of up to 87% integration of the expandable scaffolds with the host tissue at 6 months postoperation. In conclusion, the expandable scaffolds improved chondrocyte/scaffold construct integration with the host tissue and were beneficial for cartilage repair.",0

We present the short-term clinical outcome and MRI findings of a cell-free scaffold used for the treatment of these lesions in the knee. A total of 38 patients were prospectively evaluated clinically for two years following treatment with an osteochondral nanostructured biomimetic scaffold. There were 23 men and 15 women; the mean age of the patients was 30.5 years (15 to 64). Clinical outcome was assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Tegner activity scale and a Visual Analgue scale for pain. MRI data were analysed based on the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) scoring system at three, 12 and 24 months post-operatively. There was a continuous significant clinical improvement after surgery. In two patients, the scaffold treatment failed (5.3%) There was a statistically significant improvement in the MOCART precentage scores. The repair tissue filled most of the defect sufficiently. We found subchondral laminar changes in all patients. Intralesional osteophytes were found in two patients (5.3%). We conclude that this one-step scaffold-based technique can be used for osteochondral repair. The surgical technique is straightforward, and the clinical results are promising.

Due to the limitations of conventional treatments for focal chondral defects of the knee, orthobiologics have recently become an area of interest. Orthobiologics used for cartilage defects include (but are not limited to) bone marrow aspirate concentrate, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, platelet-rich plasma, and micronized allogeneic cartilage. Each of these products can be applied in the clinical setting, as an isolated surgical procedure, or as an augment to cartilage restoration surgery.",0

Unfortunately, attempts at providing such a method have provided variable and often unsatisfactory outcomes. Unicondylar knee replacement, for example, is associated with a markedly higher rate of revision when compared with total knee arthroplasty, and there is a distinct probability of disease progression in the remaining joint compartments. Small metallic caps intended for filling the cartilage defects are commercially available, but the clinical follow-up of patients who have undergone this treatment is short. Although not yet in clinical use, synthetic polymeric implant scaffolds, with and without cell-seeding, are also under development. The biomechanical requirements for treating chondral lesions, like those of total knee arthroplasty, are wear and fixation. A lesion-filling implant must carry large joint loads without damaging the opposing tissue. Integration with surrounding cartilage and subchondral bone would enhance load-sharing and load transfer. The challenge of meeting these requirements is difficult, but new forms of computational models and in vitro tests can aid in establishing performance and in rapidly screening possible solutions.",0

Stem cell treatment is a promising approach; however, replicative senescence is a challenge to acquiring large-quantity and high-quality stem cells for cartilage regeneration. Synovium-derived stem cells (SDSCs) are a tissue-specific stem cell for cartilage regeneration. Our recent findings suggest that decellularized stem cell matrix (DSCM) can rejuvenate expanded SDSCs in cell proliferation and chondrogenic potential. In this study, we were investigating (1) whether transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TGF-β3 played a similar role in chondrogenic induction of SDSCs after expansion on either DSCM or plastic flasks (plastic), and (2) whether DSCM-expanded SDSCs had an enhanced capacity in repairing partial-thickness cartilage defects in a minipig model. SDSCs were isolated from synovium in two 3-month-old pigs and DSCM was prepared using SDSCs. Passage 2 SDSCs were expanded on either DSCM or plastic for one passage. The expanded cells were evaluated for cell morphology, chondrogenic capacity, and related mechanisms. TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 were compared for their role in chondrogenesis of SDSCs after expansion on either DSCM or plastic. The chondrogenic induction medium without TGF-β served as a control. In 13 minipigs, we intraarticularly injected DSCM- or plastic-expanded SDSCs or saline into knee partial-thickness cartilage defects and assessed their repair using histology and immunohistochemistry. We found DSCM-expanded SDSCs were small, had a fibroblast-like shape, and grew quickly in a three-dimensional format with concomitant up-regulation of phosphocyclin D1 and TGF-β receptor II. Plastic-expanded SDSCs exhibited higher mRNA levels of chondrogenic markers when incubated with TGF-β3, while DSCM-expanded SDSCs displayed comparable chondrogenic potential when treated with either TGF-β isotype. In the minipig model, DSCM-expanded SDSCs were better than plastic-expanded SDSCs in enhancing collagen II and sulfated glycosaminoglycan expression in repair of partial-thickness cartilage defects, but both groups were superior to the saline control group. Our observations suggested that DSCM is a promising cell expansion system that can promote cell proliferation and enhance expanded cell chondrogenic potential in vitro and in vivo. Our approach could lead to a tissue-specific cell expansion system providing large-quantity and high-quality stem cells for the treatment of cartilage defects.",0

Gellan gum (GG) is a widely used natural polysaccharide in the field of tissue engineering (TE) and regenerative medicine due to its versatile properties. There are many reports about the successful application of GG in cartilage tissue engineering and guiding bone formation. Functional coatings and porous composite materials have been introduced in next-generation materials for treating OD, whereas osteoconductive materials, such as demineralized bone particle (DBP) or bone derivatives, are used. However, modification of porosity, biocompatibility, cell proliferation, and mechanical properties is needed. DBP can activate human mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into osteoblast cells. In this chapter, the potential application of GG with DBP in different combinations was reviewed, and the best suitable combinations were selected and further studied in small animal models for the soft and hard tissue engineering applications; also its application in the osteochondral integration fields were briefly discussed.",0

Cartilage defects change articular biomechanics and lead to eventual osteoarthritis and joint destruction. During the past decade, several competing techniques have evolved to stimulate articular cartilage repair. Micro-fracture can successfully treat small lesions of non weigh-bearing surfaces. When the damaged area is more extensive, osteochondral cylinder grafting (mosaicplasty) should be considered. Our experience includes 5 cases with follow-up of 6 months to 1 year. Between 1999 and 2000 an osteochondral transplantation (mosaicplasty) was performed in 5 patients. The defect-size in these 5 patients (2 males and 3 females) ranged between 12 mm and 23 mm in diameter and had an average-size of 15 mm. In the all of cases an average of 7.2 grafts was needed. Preoperative complaints of pain, crepitation and locking disappear. The short outcome in the modified HSS-score has shown excellent and good results. The average score value during follow-up was 93.8 (range 92-96). This outcome forms prerequisite for likewise middle-term-results. Mosaicplasty can be recommended for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral defects in the weight-bearing area of the knee as a safe procedure for transplantation of hyaline cartilage.",0

Results of patellofemoral cartilage repair are often variable. Concomitant pathologies, such as malalignment and instability are frequent. Currently no common treatment concept exists. Improvement of patellofemoral biomechanics, e.g. tubercle transfer, results in better outcome independent of the cartilage repair technique used. In patellofemoral instability reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) has recently become a focus of interest. Microfracturing and osteochondral cylinder transfer/mosaicplasty are recommended for smaller defects, while comparative studies have shown advantages for autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) in defects larger than 4 cm². In our study patients with patellofemoral scaffold ACI (MACI®), better Lysholm scores were seen with isolated trochlea defects rather than patella defects or bipolar lesions. While trochlea defects can be effectively addressed, treatment of bipolar patellofemoral defects by scaffold ACI cannot generally be recommended. Follow-up treatment of the patellofemoral joint is more time and cost-consuming than other defect localizations. For the development of therapeutic algorithms further well-defined large randomized studies are necessary.",0

The goal of surgical techniques to repair articular cartilage injuries is to achieve the regeneration of organized hyaline cartilage. Microfracture and other bone marrow stimulation techniques involve penetration of the subchondral plate in order to recruit mesenchymal stem cells into the chondral defect. The formation of a stable clot that fills the lesion is of paramount importance to achieve a successful outcome. Mosaicplasty is a viable option with which to address osteochondral lesions of the knee and offers the advantage of transplanting hyaline cartilage. However, limited graft availability and donor site morbidity are concerns. Transplantation of an osteochondral allograft consisting of intact, viable articular cartilage and its underlying subchondral bone offers the ability to address large osteochondral defects of the knee, including those involving an entire compartment. The primary theoretical advantage of autologous chondrocyte implantation is the development of hyaline-like cartilage rather than fibrocartilage in the defect, which presumably leads to better long-term outcomes and longevity of the healing tissue. Use of synthetic scaffolds is a potentially attractive alternative to traditional cartilage procedures as they are readily available and, unlike allogeneic tissue transplants, are associated with no risk of disease transmission. Their efficacy, however, has not been proven clinically.",0

A common initial treatment for focal, full-thickness articular cartilage defects is microfracture, which has been shown to have good to excellent short-term outcomes in appropriately indicated patients. Unfortunately, microfracture leads to the growth of fibrocartilage repair tissue rather than native hyaline-like cartilage and is less durable at longer-term follow-up. Efforts to augment repair and restore hyaline-like cartilage have led to the use of 2-stage procedures, such as autologous chondrocyte implantation, allografts, harvesting of autograft tissue, or complex scaffolds. An effective and reliable simple, single-stage method of cartilage restoration is needed. BioCartilageTM is a new product containing dehydrated, micronized allogeneic cartilage and is implanted with the addition of platelet rich plasma over a microfractured defect. Platelet rich plasma is shown to potentiate the cartilage repair process and is chemotactic for mesenchymal stem cells introduced following the microfracture procedure. BioCartilageTM is also an appropriate allogeneic cartilage scaffold with the proper biochemical makeup, including Collagen Type II and cartilage matrix elements. The procedure can be performed as a single-stage procedure with instrumentation and skill level consistent with standard microfracture techniques. The use of BioCartilage may create more hyaline-like tissue at the repair site vs microfracture alone.",0

Despite the limited healing potential of chondral defects, several treatment options have been proposed. However, microfracture, osteochondral autograft (or allograft) transfer, autologous chondrocyte implantation, and matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation are all associated with their respective shortcomings. As such, the optimal treatment for chondral defects of the knee remains unclear. Recently, many authors have advocated treating chondral defects with biological therapies and scaffold-based treatments. Bone marrow aspirate concentrate, a cell-based injection, has gained particular attention because of its differentiation capacity and potential role in tissue regeneration. In addition, scaffold cartilage treatments have emerged and reached clinical practice.

In contrast to the conclusive and mostly convincing mid-term results of cartilage regenerative techniques known for the knee, clinical results of innovative therapeutic approaches with glenohumeral cartilage defects are more or less absent. Current techniques include procedures for mesenchymal stem cell recruitment, such as microfracturing, (autologous) osteochondral transplantation, (matrix-associated) autologous chondrocyte transplantation and biological resurfacing, addressing focal chondral defects up to massive structural osteochondral defects.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes of patients treated with a new all-arthroscopic AMIC® (AT-AMIC®) technique with autologous bone graft for talar osteochondral defects at a follow-up of 24 months.Twenty patients underwent the AT-AMIC® procedure and autologous bone graft for type III and IV talar osteochondral lesions. Patients were evaluated pre-operatively and at 6, 12, and 24 months post-operatively using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, the visual analog scale, and the SF-12 (Short Form-12). Radiological assessment included computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART).All scores significantly improved (p < 0.05) with respect to pre-operative values after 6 months. Further improvements were detected at 24 months (AOFAS, from 57.1 ± 14.9 before surgery to 86.6 ± 10.9 after 24 months; VAS, from 8.1 ± 1.4 to 2.5 ± 2.2; SF-12, from 29.9 ± 4.1 to 48.5 ± 6.9 and from 43.8 ± 2.9 to 53.1 ± 3.9, respectively, for Physical and Mental component score).

A secondary aim was to compare the histologic properties of cartilage lesions prepared by surgeons of varying experience.Standardized cartilage lesions (8 mm × 15 mm), located to the medial/lateral condyle and medial/lateral trochlea were created within 12 human cadaver knees by 40 orthopaedic surgeons. Participants were instructed to create full-thickness cartilage defects within the marked area, shouldered by uninjured vertical walls of cartilage, and to remove the calcified cartilage layer, without violating the subchondral plate. Histologic specimens were prepared to examine the verticality of surrounding cartilage walls at the front and rear aspects of the lesions, and to characterize the properties of the surrounding cartilage, the cartilage wall profile, the debrided lesion depth, bone sinusoid access, and the bone surface profile. Comparative analysis of cartilage wall verticality measured as deviation from perpendicular was performed, and Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to examine associations between debrided wall verticality and surgeon experience.Mean cartilage wall verticality relative to the base of the lesion was superior at the rear aspect of the lesion compared to the front aspect (12.9° vs 29.2°, P < .001). Variability was identified in the morphology of the surrounding cartilage (P < .001), cartilage wall profile (P = .016), debrided lesion depth (P = .028), bone surface profile (P = .040), and bone sinusoid access (P = .009), with sinusoid access identified in 42% of cases. There was no significant association of cartilage lesion wall verticality and surgeon years in practice (rs = 0.161, P = .065) or arthroscopic caseload (rs = -0.071, P = .419).Arthroscopic cartilage lesion preparation using standard curette technique in a human cadaveric knee model results in inferior perpendicularity of the surrounding cartilage walls at the front aspect of the defect, compared to the rear aspect. This technique has shown significant variability in the depth of debridement, with debridement depths identified as either too superficial or too deep to the calcified cartilage layer in more than 60% of cases in this study. Surgeon experience does not appear to impact the morphologic properties of cartilage lesions prepared arthroscopically using ring curettes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: To optimize restoration of hyaline-like cartilage tissue, careful attention to prepared cartilage lesion morphology is advised when arthroscopically performing cartilage repair, given the tendency for standard curette technique to create inferior verticality of cartilage walls at the front of the lesion, and the variable depth of debridement achieved.",0

The engineered 3D constructs – PLGA/Fibrin/BMSCs and PLGA/BMSCs – were cultured for 3 weeks in vitro and implanted autologously to the osteochondral defect created in the rabbit knee. The in vivo constructs were harvested and evaluated by means of gross observation, histology assessment, gene expression study, sulphated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) production assay and biomechanical evaluation at 6 and 12 weeks post implantation. The results showed that the osteochondral defects treated with the PLGA/Fibrin/BMSCs constructs exhibited better repairment, more cartilaginous extracellular matrix, higher sGAG production, superior compressive strength and more intense expression of chondrogenic marker genes than the PLGA/BMSCs group. This study suggested that the PLGA/Fibrin/BMSCs has the potential to treat osteochondral defect and may be presented as a viable therapeutic option for those who would be in need from the life-extending benefits of tissue replacement or repair.",0

All three methods gave the same pattern of oligonucleotide distribution, and the intensity of the histologic signal agreed with previously published pharmacokinetic data on the relative concentration of P = S ODN in different organs. Proximal tubule cells in the kidney and Kupffer and endothelial cells in the liver were among the most heavily labeled with P = S ODN at all doses and time-points. Connective tissues proper, such as the lamina propria and submucosa of the intestine and the dermis and subcutaneous layer of the skin, were also labeled, whereas the P = S ODN signal was weak or negative in epithelial and muscle cells in the skin and intestine. At 2 hours postinjection, P = S ODN were clearly detectable in the extracellular matrix in loose and dense connective tissues, although by 24 hours, the label was predominantly intracellular. Large, nucleated cells in red marrow, and the connective tissues around bone and skeletal muscle cells and lining the knee joint, were positive for oligonucleotide, whereas P = S ODN were not detected in erythrocytes, cartilage, compact bone, and skeletal muscle. In spleen, white pulp was negative for P = S ODN, whereas cells surrounding the sinusoids and nucleated cells in the red pulp were strongly positive for P = S ODN. Our results provide specific information on the tissue and cellular localization of P = S ODN within organs in vivo. The data presented will be used as a reference for studies of P = S ODN distribution in diseased tissues and the distribution of modified oligonucleotides.

This requires a different surgical technique and preoperative planning compared to ACI alone. In addition, pain from bone marrow donor site locations can be expected and should be part of patient consent and expectations. This study evaluates whether the MRI made as part of the standard preoperative cartilage patient work up has the diagnostic accuracy to predict the need for a sandwich procedure.Retrospectively, 185 preoperative MRI scans (PD and T2 sequences) of patients planned for ACI were included. The integrity of the subchondral bone and lamina was scored by four different observers (3 radiologists, and 1 orthopaedic resident). The depth of the defect was measured perpendicular from articulating surface to the bottom of the bony lesion. The area under the curve (AUC) for subchondral defect on MRI (i.e. lamina or bone defect or expert impression), depth measurements and eventual sandwich procedure were calculated. Also inter-observer Kappa values were determined.The AUCs for lamina (0.74-0.80) and bone defect (0.73-0.79) were fair and inter-observer Kappas ranged from 0.49 to 0.76, indicating a moderate-good inter-observer agreement and moderate prediction of the need for a sandwich procedure based on the presence of lamina and or subchondral bone defect on MRI. However, depth measurements resulted in an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84-0.95,) with an optimal cut-off point at 6.5mm depth of the lesion (90% sensitivity, 80% specificity) to predict the need for a sandwich procedure.Ours is the first study examining MRI as a diagnostic tool in predicting the need for a sandwich procedure. Our results show that the integrity of the subchondral layer on MRI has a moderate role in predicting the need for an eventual autologous bone graft to augment ACI whereas in our cohort a depth of the lesion above 6.5mm accurately predicts the need for a sandwich procedure. This can aid in optimising the preoperative planning and patient consent.",0

Osteochondral defects were created in the talus of goat hind legs using a posterolateral surgical approach. The defects were filled with either autologous cancellous bone or donor demineralized bone matrix or left empty as control. After 12 weeks of healing, the specimens were analyzed with radiography, macroscopy, microcomputed tomography, histology, histomorphometry, and fluorescence microscopy. It was possible to create a standardized defect in each talus. The implanted material remained in place. The analyses showed that most bony tissue was generated in the defects filled with autologous bone and least in the control defects. Our findings show that a standard osteochondral defect can be created in the talus by a relatively simple procedure in a large animal that allows qualitative and quantitative evaluation.

The rhCII hydrogels were seeded with BM-MSCs and cultured in a xeno-free chondro-inductive medium for 14, 28 and 84 days. High-density pellet cultures served as controls. The samples were subjected to biochemical, histological and gene expression analyses. Although the cells deposited glycosaminoglycans into the extracellular space significantly more slowly in the rhCII hydrogels compared to the high-density pellets, a similar potential of matrix deposition was reached by the end of the 84-day culture. At day 28 of culture, the gene expression level for cartilage marker genes (i.e. genes encoding for Sox9 transcription factor, Collagen type II and Aggrecan) were considerably lower in the rhCII hydrogels than in the high-density pellets, but at the end of the 84-day culture period, all the cartilage marker genes analysed were expressed at a similar level. Interestingly, the expression of the matrix metallopeptidases (MMP)-13, MMP-14 and MMP-8, i.e. extracellular collagen network-degrading enzymes, were transiently upregulated in the rhCII hydrogel, indicating active matrix reorganization. This study demonstrated that the rhCII hydrogel functions as a xeno-free platform for BM-MSC chondrogenesis, although the process is delayed. The reversible catabolic reaction evoked by the rhCII hydrogel might be beneficial in graft integration in vivo and pinpoints the need to further explore the use of hydrogels containing recombinant extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to induce the chondrogenesis of MSCs.

MSCs were isolated from New Zealand White rabbits and labelled with DiR (1.25-20 mu g/mL). Viability and induction of apoptosis were assessed by XTT- and Caspase-3/-7-testing. Chondrogenic potential was evaluated by measurement of glycosaminoglycans. Labelled cells and unlabeled controls (n = 3) underwent FMT-XCT imaging before and after chondrogenic differentiation. Osteochondral defects were created surgically in rabbit knees (n = 6). Unlabeled and labelled MSCs were implanted in fibrin-clots and imaged by FMT-XCT. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple regression models. DiR-labelling of MSCs resulted in a dose-dependent fluorescence signal on planar images in trans-illumination mode. No significant reduction in viability or induction of apoptosis was detected at concentrations below 10 mu g DiR/mL (p \textbackslashtextgreater .05); the chondrogenic potential of MSCs was not affected (p \textbackslashtextgreater .05). FMT-XCT of labelled MSCs in osteochondral defects showed a significant signal of the transplant (p \textbackslashtextless .05) with additional high-resolution anatomical information about its osteochondral integration. FMT-XCT allows for detection of stem cell implantation within osteochondral regeneration processes. DiR-labelling of MSCs shows no toxic side effects or impairment of chondrogenesis. Fluorescence molecular tomography allows for detection of MSCs for osteochondral defect repair. FMT-XCT helps to improve evaluation of cell implantation and osteochondral regeneration processes.",0

Specifically, restoration of the osteochondral junction and secure integration with adjacent cartilage could be considered key factors. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of a combined material comprising a scaffold-free tissue-engineered construct (TEC) derived from synovial mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and a hydroxyapatite (HA) artificial bone using a rabbit osteochondral defect model. Osteochondral defects were created on the femoral groove of skeletally mature rabbits. The TEC and HA artificial bone were hybridized to develop a combined implant just before use, which was then implanted into defects (N=23). In the control group, HA alone was implanted (N=18). Histological evaluation and micro-indentation testing was performed for the evaluation of repair tissue. Normal knees were used as an additional control group for biomechanical testing (N=5). At hybridization, the TEC rapidly attached onto the surface of HA artificial bone block, which was implantable to osteochondral defects. Osteochondral defects treated with the combined implants exhibited more rapid subchondral bone repair coupled with the development of cartilaginous tissue with good tissue integration to the adjacent host cartilage when assessed at 6 months post implantation. Conversely, the control group exhibited delayed subchondral bone repair. In addition, the repair cartilaginous tissue in this group had poor integration to adjacent cartilage and contained clustered chondrocytes, suggesting an early osteoarthritis (OA)-like degenerative change at 6 months post implantation. Biomechanically, the osteochondral repair tissue treated with the combined implants at 6 months restored tissue stiffness, similar to normal osteochondral tissue. The combined implants significantly accelerated and improved osteochondral repair. Specifically, earlier restoration of subchondral bone, as well as good tissue integration of repair cartilage to adjacent host tissue could be clinically relevant in terms of the acceleration of postoperative rehabilitation and longer-term durability of repaired articular surface in patients with osteochondral lesions, including those with OA. In addition, the combined implant could be considered a promising MSC-based bio-implant with regard to safety and cost-effectiveness, considering that the TEC is a scaffold-free implant and HA artificial bone has been widely used in clinical practice.",0

In this article, we highlight recent work that addresses key challenges of stem cell-based therapies for osteoarthritis and provide examples of innovative ways in which stem cells can aid in the treatment of osteoarthritis.Significant progress has been made in understanding the challenges to successful stem cell therapy, such as the effects of age or disease on stem cell properties, altered stem cell function due to an inflammatory joint environment and phenotypic instability in vivo. Novel scaffold designs have been shown to enhance the mechanical properties of tissue-engineered cartilage and have also improved the integration of newly formed tissue within the joint. Emerging strategies such as injecting stem cells directly into the joint, manipulating endogenous stem cells to enhance regenerative capacity and utilizing stem cells for drug discovery have expanded the potential uses of stem cells in treating osteoarthritis.Several recent studies have greatly advanced the development and preclinical evaluation of potential stem cell-based treatments for osteoarthritis through novel approaches focused on cell therapy, tissue engineering and drug discovery.",0

They are commonly associated with ligament injuries but also may be frequently isolated. Increasing awareness and advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to increasing diagnosis and recognition of these injuries. Articular cartilage is just 2 to 4 mm thick and is avascular, alymphatic, and aneural. It has a limited capacity for healing, and there has been increasing use of cartilage repair techniques to treat these lesions in the active population. Strategies for cartilage repair include marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture/drilling, osteochondral grafting, and autologous chondrocyte transplants. MRI is an important tool in the diagnosis and grading of cartilage injury and is useful in the follow-up and monitoring of these repair procedures. It is important for radiologists and clinicians to be aware of the capabilities and limitations of MRI in assessing cartilage injury and to be familiar with common postsurgical appearances to facilitate assessment and follow-up in this population. This article reviews the clinical findings and MRI imaging appearances of cartilage injury. The management options are discussed as well as common postsurgical appearances following the various interventions.",0

Histology is probably the gold standard, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to decrease the need for invasive histological biopsies. The 3D magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score is a reliable yet elaborate tool. Moreover, literature is controversial concerning the correlation of histology and MRI. Design To test the applicability of the International Cartilage Regeneration and Joint Preservation Society (ICRS) II and MOCART 3D score for the evaluation of aged osteochondral regenerates in a large animal model, and to identify correlating histological and MRI parameters. Osteochondral defects in medial femoral condyles of n = 12 adult sheep were reconstructed with biodegradable bilayer implants. About 19.5 months postoperation, n = 10 joints were analyzed with MRI (3D MOCART score). Histological samples were analyzed using the ICRS II score; both pre- and post-training. The intraclass correlation coefficient, the inter-rater reliability, and the 95% confidence interval were calculated. Matching histological and MRI parameters were tested for correlation. Results We found a statistically significant correlation of all histological parameters. MRI parameters reflecting “overall” assessments had very strong inter-rater correlations. Statistically significant strong correlations were found for the MRI parameters defect filling, cartilage interface, bone interface, and surface. For defect overall (MRI) and overall assessment (ICRS II), we found a significant yet mild correlation. Conclusions The ICRS II and the 3D MOCART score are applicable to aged osteochondral regenerates. Prior training on the scoring systems is essential. Select MRI and histological parameters correlate; however, the only statistically significant correlation was found for overall assessment.",0

More recently, techniques have evolved from 2-step techniques that use autologous chondrocyte expansion to 1-step techniques that make use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) embedded onto biocompatible scaffolding. Our 1-step technique has been further developed to provide cell-based cartilage repair using MSCs that have the potential to be used in an off-the-shelf manner, without the need for autologous tissue harvest. Precursor MSCs can be isolated in abundance from the Wharton's jelly of umbilical cord tissue. These cells have been shown to have the desired capacity for proliferation, differentiation, and release of trophic factors that make them an excellent candidate for use in the clinical setting to provide cell-based restoration of hyaline-like cartilage. Although allogeneic in nature, these cells stimulate little or no host immune response and can be stored for long periods while maintaining viability. We present a technique of cartilage repair in the knee using Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs embedded onto scaffolding and implanted in a minimally invasive fashion using dry arthroscopy.",0

OLT have become increasingly recognized with the advancements in cartilage-sensitive diagnostic imaging modalities. Although OLT may be treated nonoperatively, a number of surgical techniques have been described for patients whom surgery is indicated. Traditionally, treatment of symptomatic OLT have included either reparative procedures, such as bone marrow stimulation (BMS), or replacement procedures, such as autologous osteochondral transplantation (AOT). Reparative procedures are generally indicated for OLT < 150 mm2 in area. Replacement strategies are used for large lesions or after failed primary repair procedures. Although short- and medium-term results have been reported, long-term studies on OLT treatment strategies are lacking. Biological augmentation including platelet-rich plasma and concentrated bone marrow aspirate is becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of OLT to enhance the biological environment during healing. In this review, we describe the most up-to-date clinical evidence of surgical outcomes, as well as both the mechanical and biological concerns associated with BMS and AOT. In addition, we will review the recent evidence for biological adjunct therapies that aim to improve outcomes and longevity of both BMS and AOT procedures.",0

Stem cell transplantation has been well implemented as a common approach in cartilage tissue engineering but has technical complexity and safety concerns. The stem cell homing-based technique emerged as an alternative promising therapy for cartilage repair to overcome traditional limitations. In this study, we constructed a composite hydrogel scaffold by combining an oriented acellular cartilage matrix (ACM) with a bone marrow homing peptide (BMHP)-functionalized self-assembling peptide (SAP). We hypothesized that increased recruitment of endogenous stem cells by the composite scaffold could enhance cartilage regeneration. Methods: To test our hypothesis, in vitro proliferation, attachment and chondrogenic differentiation of rabbit mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were tested to confirm the bioactivities of the functionalized peptide hydrogel. The composite scaffold was then implanted into full-thickness cartilage defects on rabbit knee joints for cartilage repair, in comparison with microfracture or other sample groups. Stem cell recruitment was monitored by dual labeling with CD29 and CD90 under confocal microcopy at 1 week after implantation, followed by chondrogenic differentiation examined by qRT-PCR. Repaired tissue of the cartilage defects was evaluated by histological and immunohistochemistry staining, microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 and 6 months post-surgery. Macroscopic and histological scoring was done to evaluate the optimal in vivo repair outcomes of this composite scaffold. Results: The functionalized SAP hydrogels could stimulate rabbit MSC proliferation, attachment and chondrogenic differentiation during in vitro culture. At 7 days after implantation, increased recruitment of MSCs based on CD29+ /CD90+ double-positive cells was found in vivo in the composite hydrogel scaffold, as well as upregulation of cartilage-associated genes (aggrecan, Sox9 and type II collagen). After 3 and 6 months post-surgery, the articular cartilage defect in the composite scaffold-treated group was fully covered with cartilage-like tissue with a smooth surface, which was similar to the surrounding native cartilage, according to the results of histological and immunohistochemistry staining, micro-CT and MRI analysis. Macroscopic and histological scoring confirmed that the quality of cartilage repair was significantly improved with implantation of the composite scaffold at each timepoint, in comparison with microfracture or other sample groups. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that the composite scaffold could enhance endogenous stem cell homing and chondrogenic differentiation and significantly improve the therapeutic outcome of chondral defects. The present study provides a promising approach for in vivo cartilage repair without cell transplantation. Optimization of this strategy may offer great potential and benefits for clinical application in the future.",0

A large osteochondral defect was created in the center of the femoral trochlea of adult rabbits. The rabbits were divided in four groups: Group 1 = untreated defects (controls); Group 2 = adult cartilage fragments; Group 3 = juvenile cartilage fragments; and Group 4 = adult + juvenile cartilage fragments. Killings were performed at 3 and 6 months. The defects were evaluated with ICRS macroscopic score, modified O'Driscoll score, and Collagen type II immunostaining.At 3 months, Group 4 performed better than Group 1, in terms of modified O'Driscoll score (p = 0.001) and Collagen type II immunostaining (p = 0.015). At 6 months, Group 4 showed higher modified O'Driscoll score (p = 0.003) and Collagen type II immunostaining score (p < 0.001) than Group 1. Histologically, also Group 3 performed better than Group 1 (p = 0.03), and Group 4 performed better than Group 2 (p = 0.004).Mixing adult and juvenile cartilage fragments improved cartilage repair in a rabbit model. In the clinical setting, a new ""one-stage"" procedure combining the two cartilage sources can be hypothesized, with the advantages of improved chondral repair and large defect coverage, because of the use of an off-the-shelf juvenile allograft. Further studies on larger animals and clinical trials are required to confirm these results.",0

Currently, cartilage lesions are often treated by microfracture or autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). However, these treatments are frequently reported to result in a mixture of the desired hyaline cartilage and mechanically inferior fibrocartilage. In this study, by combining the advantages of cartilage tissue engineering and decellularization technology, we developed a decellularized allogeneic hyaline cartilage graft, named dLhCG, which achieved superior efficacy in articular cartilage repair and surpassed living autologous chondrocyte-based cartilaginous engraftment and ACI. By the 6-month time point after implantation in porcine knee joints, the fine morphology, composition, phenotype, microstructure and mechanical properties of the regenerated hyaline-like cartilaginous neo-tissue have been demonstrated via histology, biochemical assays, DNA microarrays and mechanical tests. The articular cartilaginous engraftment with allogeneic dLhCG was indicated to be well consistent, compatible and integrated with the native cartilage of the host. The successful repair of articular chondral defects in large animal models suggests the readiness of allogeneic dLhCG for clinical trials.",0

Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has gained popularity over the past 20 years and has become the treatment of choice for large cartilage defects for some surgeons. Termed matrix-applied ACI (MACI), use of autologous chondrocytes cultured on porcine collagen membrane has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of symptomatic full-thickness cartilage defects in the knee. This new technique for cartilage repair is the third generation of chondrocyte implantation technology and the first to involve the use of a scaffolding to grow chondrocytes1. MACI is a simpler technique than previous generations and has more reliable chondrocyte seeding. Research has shown that patients do well postoperatively, with improvements in patient-reported outcome out to 5 years postoperatively3. These improvements are statistically greater for patients who underwent MACI when compared to those who underwent microfracture2. (1) Preoperative evaluation: patients are indicated for a cartilage procedure after magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical examination. (2) Stage 1: a diagnostic arthroscopy is performed, and chondrocytes are harvested and cultured. (3) Approach: a short vertical incision is made, followed by a medial parapatellar arthrotomy. (4) Debridement: the lesion is identified and debrided back to stable cartilage. (5): Hemostasis: hemostasis is obtained with an epinephrine-soaked sponge. (6) Template creation: foil is used to create a template of the lesion. (7) Cells cutting: with use of the foil, the membrane of cells is cut to the appropriate size and shape.

We developed a biphasic cylindrical osteochondral composite construct for such use, and conducted this study to determine its feasibility for treating osteochondral lesions in human knees.Ten patients with symptomatic osteochondral lesions at femoral condyles were treated by replacing pathological tissue with the construct of dl-poly-lactide-co-glycolide, whose lower body was impregnated with β-tricalcium phosphate and served as osseous phase. The construct had a chamber to load double-minced autologous cartilage, serving as source of chondrocytes. Osteochondral lesion was drill-fashioned a pit of identical dimension as the construct. Chondrocyte-laden construct was press-fit to fill the pit. Postoperative outcome was evaluated using Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) scale up to 24 months. Magnetic resonance image was taken, and sample tissue was collected with second-look arthroscopic needle biopsy at 12 months. Outcome parameters were primarily safety of surgery, and secondarily postoperative change in KOOS and regeneration of hyaline cartilage and cancellous bone.No patient experienced serious adverse events. Postoperative mean KOOS in ""symptoms"" subscale had not changed significantly from pre-operation until 24 months; whereas those in the other four subscales were significantly higher than pre-operation at 12 and 24 months. Second-look arthroscopy showed completely filled grafted sites, with regenerate cartilaginous surfaces flushed with surrounding native joint surface.

By combining rapid prototyping and thermally induced phase separation, the NSP-PCL scaffold was produced for matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation. Lyophilizing a water-dioxane-PCL solution created micro and nano-pores. In vitro: The scaffolds were seeded with rabbit chondrocytes and cultured in hypoxia for 6 days. qRT-PCR was performed using primers for sox9, aggrecan, collagen type 1 and 2. In vivo: 15 New Zealand White Rabbits received bilateral osteochondral defects in the femoral intercondylar grooves. Autologous chondrocytes were harvested 4 weeks prior to surgery. There were 3 treatment groups: (1) NSP-PCL scaffold without cells. (2) The Chondro-Gide(A (R)) scaffold with autologous chondrocytes and (3) NSP-PCL scaffold with autologous chondrocytes. Observation period was 13 weeks. Histological evaluation was made using the O'Driscoll score. In vitro: The expressions of sox9 and aggrecan were higher in the NSP-PCL scaffold, while expression of collagen 1 was lower compared to the Chondro-Gide(A (R)) scaffold. In vivo: Both NSP-PCL scaffolds with and without cells scored significantly higher than the Chondro-Gide(A (R)) scaffold when looking at the structural integrity and the surface regularity of the repair tissue. No differences were found between the NSP-PCL scaffold with and without cells. The NSP-PCL scaffold demonstrated higher in vitro expression of chondrogenic markers and had higher in vivo histological scores compared to the Chondro-Gide(A (R)) scaffold. The improved chondrocytic differentiation can potentially produce more hyaline cartilage during clinical cartilage repair. It appears to be a suitable cell-free implant for hyaline cartilage repair and could provide a less costly and more effective treatment option than the Chondro-Gide(A (R)) scaffold with cells.",0

One year after the procedure, a second-look arthroscopic operation was performed with biopsy of reparative tissue. The International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) visual histological assessment scale was used for histological assessment. Biopsied tissue was immunohistochemically analyzed with the use of monoclonal antihuman collagen type I and monoclonal antihuman collagen type II primary antibodies. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) concentrations in biopsied reparative cartilage samples were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). MR imaging was performed with T1- and T2-weighted imaging and three-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled (3D-SPGR) MR imaging.Four tissue samples were graded as having a mixed morphology of hyaline and fibrocartilage while the other two were graded as fibrocartilage. Average ICRS scores for each criterion were (I) 1.0 +/- 1.5; (II) 1.7 +/- 0.5; (III) 0.6 +/- 1.0; (IV) 3.0 +/- 0.0; (V) 1.8 +/- 1.5; and (VI) 2.5 +/- 1.2. Average total score was 10.7 +/- 2.8. On immunohistochemical analysis, the matrix from deep and middle layers of reparative cartilage stained positive for type II collagen; however, the surface layer did not stain well. The average GAG concentration in reparative cartilage was 76.6 +/- 4.2 microg/mg whereas that in normal cartilage was 108 +/- 11.2 microg/mg. Common complications observed on 3D-SPGR MR imaging were hypertrophy of grafted periosteum, edema-like signal in bone marrow, and incomplete repair of subchondral bone at the surgical site. Clinically, patients had significant improvements in Lysholm scores.In spite of a good clinical course, reparative cartilage after ACI had less GAG concentration and was inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in histological and immunohistochemical appearance and on MRI findings.",0

However, to regenerate articular cartilage using this method, the procedure paradoxically demands that the cell source of the articular chondrocytes (ACs) for ex vivo expansion be from the patient's own healthy cartilage, which can result in donor site morbidity. Accordingly, it is essential to develop a substitute for AC. In the present study, we investigated whether synovium-derived cells (SYs) could be used as a partial replacement for ACs in ACI. ACs and SYs from the knees of rabbits were isolated and cultured, and the growth rates of the cells were compared. To manufacture the cellular transplants, we developed a high-density suspension-shaking culture method (HDSS), which circulates the cells in culture media, promoting self-assembly of scaffold-free cellular aggregates. ACs and SYs were mixed in various ratios using HDSS. Injectable cellular transplants were harvested and transplanted into full-thickness osteochondral defects. Simultaneously, histological evaluations were conducted with toluidine blue and safranin O, and immunohistochemistry of collagen type I and II was conducted. Gene expression to evaluate chondrocyte-specific differentiation was also performed. We successfully prepared a large quantity of spheroids (spheroidal cell aggregates) in a short time using mixed ACs and SYs, for all cellular composition ratios. Our data showed that the minimal therapeutic unit for the transplants contributed to in situ regeneration of cartilage. In summary, SYs can be used as a replacement for ACs in clinical cases of ACI in patients with broad areas of osteoarthritic lesions.",0

In addition, the benefits of bone marrow stimulation for the treatment of large (>150 mm2), deep (>7 mm), or cystic lesions is limited. Autologous osteochondral transplant has emerged as one such treatment option for large lesions that may address underlying bone loss and reconstitute articular cartilage. The utility of autologous osteochondral transplant also must be interpreted with an understanding of the potential complications, including donor-site morbidity. In addition, it is important to decompress, curettage, and back fill associated cysts with bone graft. When cysts are not treated aggressively, patients may have ongoing bone marrow edema and pain.",0

The technique requires perpendicular access to the talar dome, which is often difficult to obtain for posterior or lateral lesions. Traditional methods to access these areas have required disruption of the syndesmotic complex with concern over osteotomy reduction, malalignment, and ligament disruption. An alternate to these traditional methods of access is an anterolateral tibial osteotomy. The purpose of this study was to report functional and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes in a series of patients that underwent AOT for treatment of an OLT via an anterolateral tibial osteotomy. Methods: Records of patients that underwent an anterolateral tibial osteotomy for AOT were retrospectively reviewed. Pre- and postoperative Foot and Ankle Outcome Scores (FAOS) and demographic data were recorded. Magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) was used to assess morphologic state of tibial cartilage at the repair site of the osteotomy. Quantitative T2 mapping MRI was analyzed in the superficial and deep cartilage layers of the repair site of the osteotomy and in adjacent normal cartilage to serve as control tissue. Seventeen patients with a mean age of 36.9 (range, 17-76) years underwent anterolateral tibial osteotomy with a mean follow-up of 64 (range, 29 to 108) months. MOCART data were available in 9 of 17 patients, and quantitative T2 mapping was available in 6 patients. Results: FAOS significantly improved from an average 39.2 (range, 14 to 66) out of 100 points preoperatively to 81.2 (range, 19 to 98) postoperatively ( P &lt; .01). The average MOCART score was 73.9 out of 100 points (range, 40 to 100). Quantitative T2 analysis demonstrated relaxation times that were not significantly different from the normal native cartilage in both the deep half and superficial half of interface repair tissue ( P &gt; .05). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the anterolateral tibial osteotomy was a reasonable alternative for accessing centrolateral or posterolateral OLT for AOT with limited morbidity associated with the osteotomy. The evidence demonstrated adequate osteotomy and cartilaginous healing with improvement in functional outcome scores at medium-term follow-up. Level of Evidence: Level IV, retrospective case series.",0

This technique allows advantages of both the Pridie technique and the in situ proliferation of mesenchymal cells beneath a biological collagen membrane, 'augmented', with bone marrow blood. The collagen membrane forms the roof of a 'biological chamber', and serves to protect and contains the stem cells as they differentiate into chondrocytes, which will form a healthy regenerative cartilage.",0

Previous studies have demonstrated a negative effect of blood on native cartilage; however, the effect of the contact of blood on engineered cartilage is unclear. Methods Articular chondrocytes were isolated from swine joints, expanded in monolayer culture, and seeded onto collagen membranes. The seeded membranes were cultured for 3 days in the presence of different concentrations of peripheral blood. Some samples were retrieved at the end of the blood contact, others after 21 additional days of standard culture conditions, in order to investigate the “long-term effect” of the blood contact. Results All seeded samples showed an increase in the weight and an evident cartilage-like matrix production. A concentration-dependent reduction in the mitochondrial activity due to blood contact was shown at the earlier culture time, followed by a partial recover at the longer culture time. Conclusion A blood contact of 3 days affected the chondrocytes' activity and determined a delay in the maturation of the engineered cartilage. These findings have clinical relevance, as autologous chondrocytes seeded onto biological scaffolds has become an established surgical method for articular cartilage repair. Therefore, further investigation into material sciences should be encouraged for the development of scaffold protecting the reparative cells from the blood insult.",0

First-generation ACI used a periosteal patch, leading to the second generation, in which a type I–type III collagen membrane is used to cover the autologous chondrocytes, and ultimately the third generation, in which autologous chondrocytes are seeded onto the scaffold itself. As third-generation, scaffold-based ACI techniques are becoming more widely available, interest in the long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes continues to grow, especially given the high costs associated with these procedures. Several studies have now shown persistently improved clinical outcomes at long-term follow-up, which support the increasing utilization of third-generation ACI techniques. However, it is important to continue to develop our understanding of the limitations of and expectations with third-generation ACI, particularly regarding reoperation, as well as to continue to design high-quality long-term studies that can evaluate differences in technology.",0

The biological environment regulated by the growth factors during the stage of tendon-bone healing was considered important in controlling the integrating process. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) genetically modified with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on healing after ACL reconstruction. BMSCs were infected with an adenoviral vector encoding BMP2 (AdBMP2) or bFGF (AdbFGF). Then, the infected BMSCs were surgically implanted into the tendon-bone interface. At 12 weeks postoperatively, the formation of abundant cartilage-like cells, smaller tibial bone tunnel and significantly higher ultimate load and stiffness levels, through histological analysis, micro-computed tomography and biomechanical testing, were observed. In addition, the AdBMP2-plus-AdbFGF group had the smallest bone tunnel and the best mechanical properties among all the groups. The addition of BMP2 or bFGF by gene transfer resulted in better cellularity, new bone formation and higher mechanical property, which contributed to the healing process after ACL reconstruction. Furthermore, the co-application of these two genes was more powerful and efficient than either single gene therapy.",0

It commonly occurs in the knee joint, elbow, wrist, and ankle. Although several surgical concepts have been described to treat OCD (fragment fixation, microfracture, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), and mosaicplasty), no gold standard treatment has been accepted for managing OCD. Multiple factors like age, stability of defect, and defect size should be considered while selecting a specific treatment for OCD. Here, we discuss the case of an 18-year-old patient with horizontal and noncontained OCD. The MRI and CT scan evaluations of condylar notch view showed a defect (23 mm × 19 mm × 8 mm) with ICRS grade IV lateral femoral condyle OCD that was successfully managed by gel-based ACI. After 9 years of ACI, the patient was asymptomatic with full range of motions at the knees. Improvement in visual analog scale score, International Knee Documentation Committee score, and Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue score was also seen at 9 years post-ACI.

Current clinical focal defect repair strategies have had limited success. New scaffold-based approaches may provide solutions that can repair extensive damage and prevent osteoarthritis. This study utilized a novel scaffold design that accommodated strain gauges for shear and axial load monitoring in the canine stifle joint through implantable telemetry technology. Loading changes induced by ligament disruption are widely implicated in the development of injury-related osteoarthritis. Seeding the scaffold end with progenitor cells resulted in higher shear stress than without cell seeding and histology showed significantly more bone and cartilage formation. Biomechanically, the effect of transecting the anterior cruciate ligament was a significant reduction in braking load in shear, but no change axially, and conversely a significant reduction in push-off load axially, but no change in shear. This is the first study to report shear loads measured directly in knee joint tissue. Further, advances of these measurement techniques are critical to developing improved regeneration strategies and personalizing reliable rehabilitation protocols.",0

Inclusion criteria were English language-written, original clinical research (Level of Evidence I to IV) and preclinical studies of TERM application in knee meniscal lesions. Reference lists and related articles on journal Web sites of selected articles were checked until prepublication for potential studies that could not be identified eventually by our original search. The modified Coleman Methodology score was used for study quality analysis of clinical trials.The PubMed search identified 286 articles (a similar search from 2000 to 2005 identified 161 articles). Non-English-language articles (n = 9), Level V publications (n = 19), in vitro studies (n = 118), and 102 studies not related to the topic were excluded. One reference was identified outside of PubMed. Thirty-eight references that met the inclusion criteria were identified from the original search. On the basis of our prepublication search, 2 other references were included. A total of 9 clinical and 31 preclinical studies were selected for further analysis. Of the clinical trials, 1 was classified as Level I, 2 as Level II, and 6 as Level IV. Eight referred to acellular scaffold implantation for partial meniscal replacement, and one comprised fibrin clot application. The mean modified Coleman Methodology score was 48.0 (SD, 15.7). Of the preclinical studies, 11 original works reported on studies using large animal models whereas 20 research studies used small animals. In these studies the experimental design favored cell-seeded scaffolds or scaffolds enhanced with growth factors (GFs) in attempts to improve tissue healing, as opposed to the plain acellular scaffolds that were predominant in clinical trials. Injection of mesenchymal stem cells and gene therapy are also presented as alternative strategies.Partial meniscal substitution using acellular scaffolds in selected patients with irreparable loss of tissue may be a safe and promising procedure. However, there is only 1 randomized controlled study supporting its application, and globally, many methodologic issues of published trials limit further conclusions. We registered a different trend in preclinical trials, with most considering augmentation of scaffolds by cells and/or GFs, as opposed to the predominantly acellular approach in clinical trials. Different TERM approaches to enhance meniscal repair or regeneration are in preclinical analysis, such as the use of mesenchymal stem cells, gene therapy, and GFs alone or in combination, and thus could be considered in the design of subsequent trials.Level IV, systematic review of Level I to IV studies.",0

Oxidative stress is considered one of the pathophysiological factors in the progression of OA. We investigated the effects of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE), which is an antioxidant, on monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced arthritis of the knee joint of rat, which is an animal model of human OA. GSPE (100 mg/kg or 300 mg/kg) or saline was given orally three times per week for 4 weeks after the MIA injection. Pain was measured using the paw withdrawal latency (PWL), the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and the hind limb weight bearing ability. Joint damage was assessed using histological and microscopic analysis and microcomputerized tomography. Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP13) and nitrotyrosine were detected using immunohistochemistry. Administration of GSPE to the MIA-treated rats significantly increased the PWL and PWT and this resulted in recovery of hind paw weight distribution (P < 0.05). GSPE reduced the loss of chondrocytes and proteoglycan, the production of MMP13, nitrotyrosine and IL-1β and the formation of osteophytes, and it reduced the number of subchondral bone fractures in the MIA-treated rats. These results indicate that GSPE is antinociceptive and it is protective against joint damage in the MIA-treated rat model of OA. GSPE could open up novel avenues for the treatment of OA.",0

The main functions of articular cartilage are stress transmission, absorption, and friction reduction. The cartilage cannot be repaired and regenerated once it has been damaged, and it needs to be replaced by artificial joints. Many approaches, such as artificial joint replacement, hyaluronic acid injection, microfracture surgery and cartilage tissue engineering have been applied in clinical treatment. Basically, some of these approaches are foreign material implantation for joint replacement to reach the goal of pain reduction and mechanism support. This study demonstrated another frontier in the research of cartilage reconstruction by applying regeneration medicine additive manufacturing (3D Printing) and stem cell technology. Light curing materials have been modified and tested to be printable and cytocompatible for stem cells in this research. Design of experiments (DOE) is adapted in this investigation to search for the optimal manufacturing parameter for biocompatible scaffold fabrication and stem cell attachment and growth.

However, hydrogels possess only limited mechanical strength, and must therefore be reinforced for applications in load-bearing conditions. In most approaches the reinforcing component and the hydrogel network have poor interactions and the synergetic effect of both materials on the mechanical properties is not effective. Therefore, in the present study, a thermoplastic polymer blend of poly(hydroxymethylglycolide-co-ε-caprolactone)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (pHMGCL/PCL) was functionalized with methacrylate groups (pMHMGCL/PCL) and covalently grafted to gelatin methacrylamide (gelMA) hydrogel through photopolymerization. The grafting resulted in an at least fivefold increase in interface-binding strength between the hydrogel and the thermoplastic polymer material. GelMA constructs were reinforced with three-dimensionally printed pHMGCL/PCL and pMHMGCL/PCL scaffolds and tested in a model for a focal articular cartilage defect. In this model, covalent bonds at the interface of the two materials resulted in constructs with an improved resistance to repeated axial and rotational forces. Moreover, chondrocytes embedded within the constructs were able to form cartilage-specific matrix both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, by grafting the interface of different materials, stronger hybrid cartilage constructs can be engineered.",0

To replace a severely damaged ligament, a tissue-engineered graft preinstalled with interfacial fibrocartilage, which is being regenerated from stem cells, appears to be more promising than ligament-alone graft. Such a concept can be realized by a biomimetic approach of establishing a dynamic communication of stem cells with bone cells and/or ligament fibroblasts in vitro.The current study has two objectives. The first objective is to demonstrate functional coculture of bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) with mature bone cells/ligament fibroblasts as evidenced by gap-junctional communication in vitro. The second objective is to investigate the role of BMSCs in the regeneration of fibrocartilage within the coculture.Rabbit bone/ligament fibroblasts were dual-stained with DiI-Red and calcein (gap-junction permeable dye), and cocultured with unlabeled BMSCs at fixed ratio (1:10). The functional gap junction was demonstrated by the transfer of calcein from donor to recipient cells that was confirmed and quantified by flow cytometry. Type 2 collagen (cartilage extracellular matrix-specific protein) expressed by the mixed cell lines in the cocultures were estimated by real-time reverse transcription PCR and compared with that of the ligament-bone coculture (control).Significant transfer of calcein into BMSCs was observed and flow cytometry analyses showed a gradual increase in the percentage of BMSCs acquiring calcein with time. Cocultures that included BMSCs expressed significantly more type 2 collagen compared with the control.The current study, for the first time, reported the expression of gap-junctional communication of BMSCs with two adherent cell lines of musculoskeletal system in vitro and also confirmed that incorporation of stem cells augments fibrocartilage regeneration.

Studies have shown that meniscal repairs have better outcomes over both partial and total meniscectomies. Tissue engineering strategies to repair meniscus tears have been explored using cell sources that involve a donor as well as a period of in vitro cell expansion before use. This study explored cell sources that could be easily harvested and rapidly isolated by enzymatic digestion and cannulated delivery. Methods. Bovine menisci were used to create a bucket handle tear. Cell lines were established from meniscus, synovium, and adipose tissue and fluorescently labeled. At passages P2, P4, and P8, cells were added to the defect from the following experimental groups: cells alone, collagen gel, collagen scaffold, or hyaluronic acid. Menisci constructs were xenografted subcutaneously onto the dorsum of athymic rats and incubated for 3, 6, and 9 weeks, at which time they were retrieved and processed for histology. Results. Meniscal cells were able to repair defects faster and significantly better than adipose or synovium derived cells. Adipose cells were the least effective in comparison. Repair was significantly better at 9 weeks compared with 6 and 3 weeks. Macroscopic examination of menisci that received cell implants showed the thickest tissue in menisci that had collagen implants, and the thinnest fill occurred in menisci treated with cells alone. Histology confirmed no cells or integrative repair in the control specimens. Conclusions. Delivery of cells alone outperformed the additional use of biomaterials. Our results suggest a strategy that would use both meniscus and synovial cells for arthroscopic meniscal repair.",0

This third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) technique improves on the limitations of previous methods, including the risk of uneven chondrocyte distribution at the time of implantation and graft hypertrophy. Given the compliant properties of the scaffold, the graft can be easily shaped to treat irregular chondral defects and applied to articular surfaces with multiplanar geometry (e.g., patella, trochlea). Although ACI techniques are ideally suited to treat chondral surface defects, the ACI ""sandwich"" technique can be used to treat large osteochondral defects with significant bone loss (>8 mm). Historically, this procedure uses autologous bone graft to replace areas of osseous deficiency along with 2 type I/III collagen bilayer membranes to securely contain the cultured chondrocytes within the defect.

In an attempt to fulfill patients' expectations and successfully treat this pathology, various techniques have been developed over the years. Treatments proposed for cartilage lesions are described with their rationale and indications, ranging from conservative measures to surgical approaches, reparative or regenerative. Among the numerous and heterogeneous procedures proposed over time to treat cartilage defects none has clearly proven to lead to a hyaline articular surface nor to offer better clinical results. Regenerative procedures have been introduced as ambitious techniques that aim to overcome the limitations of the more traditional reparative approaches and restore the articular surface with a hyaline-like tissue; improvement in tissue engineering with new scaffolds as well as new regenerative options involving growth factors or MSCs are currently being investigated as promising solutions to further improve the treatment of cartilage lesions. However, the current literature findings are not conclusive. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate new regenerative approaches, to show clearly advantages and disadvantages with respect to the more traditional procedures, besides their potential, limits, and indications to improve the treatment of patients affected by chondral and osteochondral lesions. Since clear and commonly accepted treatment algorithms are not available in the literature, the massively increasing number of controversial results may be confusing for the orthopaedic surgeon who has to choose the proper management of patients with cartilage lesions. Thus, the results obtained through the study of the authors' 20 years' experience in cartilage treatment were analyzed to give some indications on the potential and limits of different treatment approaches available in clinical practice.",0

Chaque technique, les microfractures, les greffes ostéochondrales et la greffe de chondrocytes, sera développée avec ses principes chirurgicaux, sa prise en charge rééducative spécifique et ses résultats. Le protocole postopératoire sera peu spécifique dans les premières semaines : pour les lésions condyliennes, la protection de la zone de greffe est indispensable par un non-appui strict mais la mobilisation du genou est possible d’emblée ; pour les lésions rotuliennes, l’appui est autorisé mais la flexion est limitée. Ensuite, les délais de reprise d’appui, de renforcement musculaire, de reprise des sports sont spécifiques de chaque technique. Ces trois techniques ne s’appliquent qu’à des lésions symptomatiques des condyles en zone d’appui ou de la fémoro-patellaire chez des sujets jeunes ; l’arthrose même débutante est exclue. Ces lésions peuvent être associées à une rupture du ligament croisé antérieur et la réparation cartilagineuse d’emblée sera discutée. The objective of the present study is to assess the techniques, indications and management of the three principal repair methods of cartilaginous lesions of the knee. Arthroscopic irrigation and debridement are excluded. The most important articles of the last 20 years have been evaluated favouring those written by the protagonists of the technique and those with the longest follow-up. Each technique, i.e. the microfractures, the osteochondral grafts and the chondrocyte grafts, is explained in detail with its surgical principles, management of specific reeducation and results. Postoperative treatment is not very different during the first weeks ; for condyle lesions protection of the graft site is mandatory by strict avoidance of non weight bearing, whereas immediat mobilisation of the knee is possible; for patellar lesions, weight bearing is permitted whereas flexion is limited. Later, the delay concerning resumption of weight bearing, muscular training and sports is specific for each technique. These three techniques are only apply to symptomatic lesions of the condyle at the weight-hearing zone or the femoro-patellar site in young patients. The degenerative knee, even in its beginning, is excluded. Those lesions can be linked to rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament and immediate cartilaginous repair is discussed.",0

Osteochondral defects were made in the center of rabbit and swine patellae, and magnetically labeled MSCs were injected into the knee joints either under the direction of an external magnetic force or with no magnetic force applied. In the rabbit model we evaluated the patellae macroscopically and histologically, and in the swine model we observed the patellae arthroscopically.Accumulation of magnetically labeled MSCs to the osteochondral defect was shown macroscopically and histologically in the rabbit model and was shown by arthroscopic observation to be attached to the chondral defect in the swine model.We showed the ability to deliver magnetically labeled MSCs to a desired place in the knee joint.Our novel approach is applicable for human cartilage defects and may open a new era of repairing cartilage defects caused by osteoarthritis or trauma by use of a less invasive technique.",0

From 56,098 evaluated studies, 133 studies could be further pursued. These supplied data concerning microfracturing, the osteochondral autograft transplantation system (OATS), the autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and the matrix induced chondrocyte implantation (MACI). The modified Coleman Methodical Score (CMS) and the Level of Evidence (LOE) were applied to evaluate the quality.In these studies, a total of 6,920 patients were reviewed with a median of 32 patients per study and a mean follow-up of 24 months. The mean CMS was 58 of 100 points. No study reached 100 points in the CMS. Three studies reached a level above 90. Ten studies were Level I, five studies reached Level II. Seven studies reached Level III, 111 studies Level IV. MRI scans to verify the clinical data were used by only 72 studies. The means in the modified CMS were for the different procedures as follows: ACI 58 points, MACI 57 points, microfracturing 68 points and OATS 50 points. 24 studies applied the Lysholm Score (LS) for clinical evaluation of cartilage surgery. All operative procedures yielded comparable improvements of the LS (n.s.) meaning that no operative procedure proved superior.As the majority of studies evaluated by this review is insufficient for EBM purposes more coherent studies with LOE of I or II are needed. Co-relating the systems of CMS and LOE and validating the applied scores seems desirable.",0

In the first experiment, the DN gel was implanted in a surgically created defect in the femoral trochlea of rabbit knee joints and the left knee was used as the control. Evaluations using a confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that the DN gel did not affect the surface microstructure (surface roughness, the number of small pits) of the counterface cartilage in vivo at 4 and 12 weeks. The histology also showed that the DN gel hadno pathological damage on the cartilage matrices and cells at 4 weeks. However, two of the five DN gel-implanted knees showed mild irregularity on the counterface cartilage surface at 12 weeks. In the second experiment, the friction property between the normal and the artificial cartilage was determined using a joint simulator apparatus. The ex vivo mean friction coefficient of the DN gel to normal cartilage was 0.029, while that of the normal-to-normal cartilage articulation was 0.188. The coefficient of the DN gel-to-normal cartilage articulation was significantly lower than that of the normal-to-normal cartilage articulation (p < 0.0001). This study suggested that the PAMPS/PDMAAm DN gel has very low friction coefficient on normal cartilage and has no significant detrimental effects on counterface cartilage in vivo, and can be a promising material to develop the artificial cartilage.",0
1149,https://openalex.org/W2340316393,,Autologous chondrocyte transplantation for reconstruction of isolated joint defects: the Assaf Harofeh experience.,"Articular cartilage is incapable of undergoing self-repair since chondrocytes lose their mitotic ability as early as the first year of life. Defects in articular cartilage, especially in weight-bearing joints, will predictably deteriorate toward osteoarthritis. No method has been found to prevent this deterioration. Drilling of the subchondral bone can lead to fibrocartilage formation and temporary repair that slowly degrades. Animal experiments indicate that introducing proliferating chondrocytes such as cultured articular chondrocytes can reliably reconstruct joint defects.To describe our clinical experience in culturing and transplanting autologous chondrocytes.Biopsies were obtained from 10 patients, aged 18-45, undergoing a routine arthroscopy in which a cartilage defect was identified with indications for cartilage transplantation. The biopsies were further processed to establish chondrocyte cultures. ACT was performed in 8 of the 10 patients because of persistent symptoms for at least 2 months post-arthroscopy. All patients (6 men and 2 women) had a grade IV cartilage defect in the medial or lateral femoral condyle, and three had a defect in the trochlear region as well. Biopsies were removed from the lateral rim of the superior aspect of the femur, and cells were cultured in a clean room. Following a 2 order of magnitude expansion, cells were implanted under a periosteal flap.The eight patients implanted with autologous cells were followed for 6 months to 5 years (average 1 year). Complaints of giving-way, effusion and joint locking resolved in all patients, and pain as assessed by the visual analogue score was reduced by an average of 50%. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging studies in all patients revealed that the defects were filled with tissue having similar signal characteristics to cartilage.Chondrocyte implantation is a procedure capable of restoring normal articular cartilage in cases with isolated joint defects. Pain can be predictably reduced, while joint locking and effusion are eliminated. The effect on osteoarthritis progression in humans has not yet been elucidated.",0

Current surgical techniques to repair osteochondral defects lead to poor subchondral bone regeneration and fibrocartilage formation, which is often associated with joint pain and stiffness. The objective of this pilot clinical study is to evaluate the performance and the intrinsic stability of a newly developed biomimetic osteochondral scaffold and to test the safety and the feasibility of the surgical procedure.A gradient composite osteochondral scaffold based on type I collagen-hydroxyapatite was obtained by nucleating collagen fibrils with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. Thirteen patients (15 defect sites) were treated with scaffold implantation from January 2007 to July 2007: four at the medial femoral condyle, two at the lateral femoral condyles, five at the patellas and four at the trochleas. The mean size of the defects was 2.8 cm(2) (range: 1.5-5.9 cm(2)). All patients were followed up prospectively. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to determine ""the early postoperative adherence rate"" at 4-5 weeks and 25-26 weeks after scaffold implantation. Moreover, the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score was performed on every MRI. Two second-looks were performed at 6 months; cartilage repair was assessed using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) visual scoring system and histological and immunohistochemical analysis of the two biopsies was carried out.A completely attached graft and repair tissue were found in 13 of 15 lesions (86.7%). A partial detachment was observed in two patients (13.3%). No detached grafts were found. Complete filling of the cartilage defect and congruency of the articular surface were seen in 10 lesions (66.7%) with MRI evaluation at 6 months. The complete integration of the grafted cartilage was detected in eight lesions (53.3%). Subchondral bone changes (oedema or sclerosis) were found in eight defects (53.3%). Statistical analysis showed a significant improvement in the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective and objective scores from preoperative to 6 months' follow-up (p<0.0005). Visual scoring of the repaired tissue at second-look revealed a normal repair score in one case and a near-normal repair score in the other case. Histological analysis showed the formation of subchondral bone without the presence of biomaterial. The cartilage repair tissue appeared to be engaged in an ongoing maturation process.The technique is safe and MRI evaluation at short-term follow-up has demonstrated good stability of the scaffold without any other fixation device. The preliminary clinical results at short-term follow-up are encouraging. A clinical and MRI study with longer follow-up and randomised studies will be done to confirm the high potential of this novel osteochondral scaffold.",0

Associated Factors, Operative Options, and Preliminary Results from the CartilageRegistry DGOU","Zusammenfassung Degenerativ bedingte Knorpelschäden im medialen Kniekompartiment. Assoziierte Faktoren, operative Optionen und präliminäre Ergebnisse. Ergebnisse aus dem KnorpelRegister (DGOU). Zielsetzung Ziel dieser Untersuchung war es, den Stellenwert der knorpelregenerativen Behandlungen bei Patienten mit degenerativ bedingten Knorpelschäden des Kniegelenkes, vor allem bei Vorliegen von kombinierten Defekten, unter dem Aspekt der Versorgungsforschung anhand der Daten aus dem KnorpelRegister in Deutschland zu untersuchen. Material und Methode Das KnorpelRegister (DGOU) besteht seit dem Jahre 2013. Bis August 2016 wurden im Kniemodul des Registers insgesamt 1847 Behandlungsfälle erfasst, von denen 432 Patienten (23,3%) degenerativ bedingte Knorpelschäden im Bereich des medialen Kompartiments aufwiesen. Entsprechend den Präferenzen der verschiedenen an der Erfassung beteiligten Einrichtungen wurden bei diesen Patienten verschiedene Verfahren der knorpelregenerativen Therapie angewandt. Die Kontrolluntersuchungen ([Online-]Evaluation) erfolgte nach 6, 12 und 24 Monaten durch Befragung der subjektiven Patientenzufriedenheit und Bestimmung des KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score). Ergebnisse Insgesamt hatten 358 Patienten isolierte Defekte im Bereich des medialen Kondylus, 25 Patienten isolierte tibiale Defekte und bei den restlichen 49 Patienten lagen kombinierte Defekte (kissing lesions) vor. Unterschiede zwischen Männern und Frauen in Bezug auf die Defektpathologie gab es nicht, Patienten mit isolierten femoralen bzw. tibialen Defekten waren signifikant jünger als Patienten mit kombinierten Defekten. Tendenziell hatten Patienten mit einem tibialen Defekt eine kürzere Anamnesedauer. Als Therapie kam in 20,1% der Fälle die Knochenmarkstimulation, in 39,9% die autologe Knorpeltransplantation allein bzw. in 8,1% der Fälle die Knorpeltransplantation in Kombination mit einer Spongiosaplastik zur Anwendung. Sonstige Therapieverfahren waren Bohrung, osteochondrale Transplantationen, matrixassoziierte Mikrofrakturierung, Débridement. In 17,9% der Fälle erfolgten kombinierte Verfahren. Begleiteingriffe wurden bei 39,7% der Patienten mit einem isolierten femoralen, bei 56,0% der Patienten mit einem tibialen und in 67,6% bei kombinierten Defekten durchgeführt. Hierbei handelte es sich in den meisten Fällen um zusätzliche Tibiakopfosteotomien. Subjektiv waren Patienten mit einem femoralen Defekt signifikant häufiger sehr zufrieden/zufrieden, gefolgt von Patienten mit isoliertem Tibiadefekt. Am schlechtesten schlossen Patienten mit kombinierten Defekten ab. Der KOOS betrug zur Eingangsuntersuchung im Median 52 Punkte und stieg nach 6 Monaten auf 75, nach 12 Monaten auf 78 und nach 24 Monaten auf 80 Punkte an. Dabei zeigten Patienten mit einem isolierten femoralen Defekt tendenziell bessere Ergebnisse als die übrigen Patienten. Die Gesamtrevisionsrate betrug 7,1%. Schlussfolgerungen Die Daten zeigen, dass bei der Behandlung degenerativer Knorpelschäden des medialen Gelenkkompartiments des Kniegelenkes (Früharthrosen) durch knorpelregenerative Verfahren in solchen Fällen kurz- und mittelfristig akzeptable Ergebnisse erzielt werden können.",0

So far, satisfactory solution to this subsistent problem has not been found, but transgenic therapy may be a promising way. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a tissue-engineered cartilage that was transfected with morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP 7) in repairing the cartilaginous defects of rabbit knee joints. Chondrocytes were transfected with BMP-7 gene (5 x 10(6) cells/ml), inoculated into the collagen-fibrin gel scaffolds, and cultured for 14 days. Then, the scaffolds were implanted onto the created defects (5.0 mm in diameter) in rabbits' knee joints. After 12 weeks, the rabbits were sacrificed and histological sections were evaluated using modified O'Driscoll cartilage scores; In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect the expression of BMP-7 mRNA and BMP-7 at the implanted site while the content of DNA and GAG was determined as well. A better quality of repairs was observed at the 12th week after implantation when compared to the control group using histological analyses. The content of DNA and specific secretion of GAG in the treatment group is statistically significant different compared with the control group. Gene therapy may be a promising treatment method, but the novel therapy approach needs further studies with respect to a longer follow-up period.",0

We aimed to systematically organize stem cell treatment methods by reviewing the literature. The treatment methods used in 27 clinical trials were examined and reviewed. The clinical processes were separated into seven categories: cell donor, cell source, cell preparation, delivery methods, lesion preparation, concomitant procedures, and evaluation. Stem cell donors were sub-classified as autologous and allogeneic, and stem cell sources included bone marrow, adipose tissue, peripheral blood, synovium, placenta, and umbilical cord. Mesenchymal stem cells can be prepared by the expansion or isolation process and attached directly to cartilage defects using matrices or injected into joints under arthroscopic observation. The lesion preparation category can be divided into three subcategories: chondroplasty, microfracture, and subchondral drilling. The concomitant procedure category describes adjuvant surgery, such as high tibial osteotomy. Classification codes were assigned for each subcategory to provide a useful and convenient method for organizing documents associated with stem cell treatment. This classification system will help researchers choose more unified treatment methods, which will facilitate the efficient comparison and verification of future clinical outcomes of stem cell therapy for osteoarthritis.",0

Therefore, wide-ranging cartilage damage rarely resolves spontaneously. Cartilage damage is typically treated by chondrocyte transplantation, mosaicplasty or microfracture. Recent advances in tissue engineering have prompted research on techniques to repair articular cartilage damage using a variety of transplanted cells. We studied the repair and regeneration of cartilage damage using layered chondrocyte sheets prepared on a temperature-responsive culture dish. We previously reported achieving robust tissue repair when covering only the surface layer with layered chondrocyte sheets when researching partial-thickness defects in the articular cartilage of domestic rabbits. The present study was an experiment on the repair and regeneration of articular cartilage in a minipig model of full-thickness defects. Good safranin-O staining and integration with surrounding tissues was achieved in animals transplanted with layered chondrocyte sheets. However, tissue having poor safranin-O staining-not noted in the domestic rabbit experiments-was identified in some of the animals, and the subchondral bone was poorly repaired in these. Thus, although layered chondrocyte sheets facilitate articular cartilage repair, further investigations into appropriate animal models and culture and transplant conditions are required.",0

We hypothesized that in tissue-engineered osteochondral grafts synthesized by bonding mesenchymal stem cell-loaded hydrogels to a porous material, the choice of the porous scaffold would affect graft healing to host bone, and the quality of cell restoration at the hyaline cartilage surface. Bone marrow-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells were suspended in hydrogels that were attached to cylinders of porous tantalum metal, allograft bone, or a bioactive glass. The tissue-engineered osteochondral grafts, thus created were implanted into experimental defects in rabbit knees. Subchondral bone restoration, defect fill, bone ingrowth-implant integration, and articular tissue quality were compared between the three subchondral materials at 6 and 12 weeks. Bioactive glass and porous tantalum were superior to bone allograft in integrating to adjacent host bone, regenerating hyaline-like tissue at the graft surface, and expressing type II collagen in the articular cartilage. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Methods Five hundred and eight patients underwent primary ACLR and diagnostic arthroscopy. All identified cartilage lesions were graded using the Outerbridge system. All patients underwent isokinetic strength testing. The association between cartilage Outerbridge grade and a \textbackslashtextgreater= 90% Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) and recurrent ACL injury risk at mean 38.7 month follow-up (SD 31.8) was evaluated via multivariate regression analysis. Results Grade 2 or higher damage was present in 394 (77.5%) of patients, grade 3 or higher in 143 (28.1%) and grade 4 in 83 (16.4%) at time of ACLR. Ipsilateral ACLR graft rupture occurred in 31 (6.1%) of patients. Contralateral ACL injury occurred in 19 (3.7%). Patients with grade 2 or higher damage were significantly less likely to meet an LSI goal of \textbackslashtextgreater= 90% for fast (300 degrees/s) isokinetic extension. There was no association with slow isokinetic extension. Cartilage lesion severity at or beyond grade 2 had a similar effect on isokinetic testing results regardless of compartment involvement or performance of microfracture. Patients with grade 2-4 cartilage damage were less likely to sustain a second ipsilateral ACL injury or a contralateral native ACL injury. Conclusions Cartilage damage seen at time of ACL reconstruction is common and associated with lower likelihood of achieving \textbackslashtextgreater= 90% symmetry for isokinetic extension strength at 6 months after surgery. However, lower recurrent ACL injury rates are seen in patients with concurrent cartilage damage. These data may inform future clinical decisions regarding operative managment of recurrent ACL injuries.",0

Tissue engineering or tissue regeneration is an important method to repair articular cartilage defects. While it has recently been paid much attention to use bilayered porous scaffolds to repair both cartilage and subchondral bone, it is interesting to examine to what extent a bilayer scaffold composed of the same kind of the biodegradable polymer poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) can restore an osteochondral defect. Herein, we fabricated bilayered PLGA scaffolds and used a rabbit model to examine the efficacy of implanting the porous scaffolds with or without bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The present manuscript reports the regenerative potential up to 24 weeks.The osteochondral defect, 4 mm in diameter and 5 mm in depth, was created in the medial condyle of each knee in 23 rabbits. The bilayered PLGA scaffolds with a pore size of 100-200 μm in the chondral layer and a pore size of 300-450 μm in the osseous layer, seeded with or without BMSCs in the chondral layer, were then transplanted into the osteochondral defect of each knee. The osteochondral defect created in the same manner was untreated to act as the control. At 12 and 24 weeks postoperatively, condyles were harvested and analyzed using histology, immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and biomechanical testing to evaluate the efficacy of osteochondral repair.No joint erosion, inflammation, swelling, or deformity was observed, and all animals maintained a full range of motion. Compared with the untreated blank group, the groups implanting the bilayered scaffolds with or without cells exhibited much better resurfacing, similar to the surrounding normal tissue. The histological scores of neotissues repaired by the scaffold with cells were closer to that of normal tissue. Although the biomechanical properties of neotissues were not as good as the normal tissue, no significant difference was found between the gene levels of neotissues repaired by the scaffold with or without cells and that of the normal tissue. The repair of the osteochondral defect tends to be stable 12 weeks after implantation.Our bilayered PLGA porous scaffold supports long-term osteochondral repair via in vivo tissue engineering or regeneration, and its effect can be further facilitated under the scaffold seeded with allogenic BMSCs.The bilayered PLGA porous scaffold can facilitate the repair of osteochondral defects and has potential for application in osteochondral tissue engineering.",0

Half of the surgeons indicated that patient age of 50 was the upper limit for cartilage repair. Irrespective of activity level, microfracture (60-67%) was the most frequently used technique for lesions smaller 2.5 cm2. In lesions larger than 4 cm2, MACI was the most commonly advocated procedure (67%). In patients with high activity levels, mosaicplasty was the first choice (69%) for lesions between 2.5 and 4 cm2 in size, followed by MACI (27%).Patient age, activity level, BMI and lesion size were important determinants for the choice of treatment of isolated chondral lesions in the knee. These results reflect the choices of experienced knee surgeons in the country. Although not widely performed in Turkey and has limited reimbursement by the health care system, the first choice for defects over 4 cm2 was second generation ACI. Third party payers & health reimbursement authorities should take into account that large defects require methods which are relatively expensive and need high technology.

Since bone marrow contains osteochondral progenitor cells and bioactive agents, it is hypothesized that the combination of scaffold and bone marrow would be a superior composite material for osteochondral repair. This hypothesis will be tested by comparing the outcome of osteochondral defects filled with a fibronectin-coated hyaluronan-based sponge (ACP) with or without autologous bone marrow. Thirty-three 4-month-old rabbits received 3-mm diameter osteochondral defects that were then filled with ACP loaded or not with autologous bone marrow. Rabbits were sacrificed at 2, 3, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after surgery and the condyles processed for histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation. The defects were graded with a histologic scoring scale. Except for the 3-week specimens, the histologic appearance of the defects was similar in both groups. Four weeks after surgery, the defects were filled with bone with a top layer of cartilage well integrated with the adjacent cartilage. Twelve and 24 weeks after surgery, the defects again showed bone filling. The primary difference between the 4-week samples and the 12- and 24-week samples was that the layer of cartilage that appeared to be thinner than the adjacent cartilage. At each harvest time, the overall histologic scores of the specimens did not reveal statistical differences between the treatment groups. However, as revealed by the results of the 3-week sacrifices, bone marrow loading appeared to accelerate the first stages of the repair process. The fibronectin-coated hyaluronan-based scaffold appears to organize the natural response and facilitate the integration of the neo-cartilage with the adjacent tissue. The fundamental tissue engineering principles derived from this study should provide guidelines for the development of comparable clinical reconstructive therapies.",0
