1. Initial search in ASReview
2. Relevant documents are identified & stopping rule is triggered after
3. Re-rank the documents left with our outlier detection model which also utilizes the already found relevant papers 
4. Outliers should be ranked fairly high so we can do another quick search & find many outliers before triggering our second stopping rule

SUBMODEL #1: Citation Network Analysis
--------------------------------------
Instead of looking purely at the content, we can include a citation network 
in our model which gives us some extra information to identify the outlier. 
Looking for documents with similar citations to the already identified relevant 
documents has proven ineffective. Reason for this might be that citations are
already considered in the initial ranking process, which means that citations 
alone are not enough to find the outlier as we would've already found it. 
However, there is another way we can use the citation network. 
In the Appenzeller dataset, the outlier in question is completely isolated in 
terms of citations. It has no connections to the other relevant document or the 
prior documents. While this seems bad, this could be beneficial: instead of 
looking for documents with similar citations, we search for isolated documents. 
Measuring whether a document is isolated in terms of citations should be done 
dynamically (by comparing its citation behaviour to other documents from the 
same dataset) as it is reasonable to assume citation behaviour/patterns might 
be different across multiple datasets. 
We want our model to be adaptable & robust, thus we take the dynamic approach.
